FAANG, MSFT, TSLA, NIKE, WMT, JPM, PYPL, AXP, BABA, NVDA, AMD, SBUX, CRM.  Or ETF\u2019s like MGK, FNGS, and SOXX if you don\u2019t have the capital to get in on single equity options.\n\n2)\tHold for at least half of the 6 months until expiration.  \n\n3)\tThe long term goal is to buy and hold shares.  This is what rich people do.  Hard assets that can\u2019t quickly evaporate like options can.  Same choice of companies as above.  Just the good shit. Hold assets that slowly grow. Cash gang = chicken coop.\n\n4)\tIn order to protect your winnings, make sure half of your account is shares.  \n\n5)\tUse margin sparingly.  Less than half of what they are offering you.\n\n6)\tIf you need to do a weekly just to have a little casino thrill in your life it should be less than a grand.  Weeklies are not how real wealth is built.  But it\u2019s ok if you see a strong trend but don\u2019t YOLO your whole stack.

But then I lost like 3/4\u2019s of my stack staying short when the market bottomed on March 23rd.  So I needed to come up with a system to protect my gains.  Hence, the Coda code of conduct.\n\nFor example, I started with $75k but now I have around $162k in shares.  So, no matter what happens I\u2019ll likely be ahead of where I started.  I\u2019m slightly out of balance because I have more options than shares.  $196k in calls vs $162k in shares.  So I\u2019m like $34k out of balance, somewhat breaking my own rule.  So I\u2019m living a little dangerously until 9/18 at which time I\u2019m going to execute 4 apple calls and 2 msft calls.  Which will bring my share total up like $65k.  I might have to sell some options so I have the buying power in my account to get this done.  At that point, I will have more shares than options so I\u2019ll be green lit to buy more calls.  This is how I enforce discipline on myself to not get to overextended.  Leverage, but not too much leverage.  Good luck to us all!",

Epic knew that it was breaching its contract with Apple when it published the update, but did it anyway, she said, accusing the company of dishonesty. She rejected claims that Apple's in-app payment system is a separate product an an example of illegal bundling, as well as that Apple's app store operates as a monopoly.\n\n* Fortnite players on iOS have a variety of choices to access the game even if it is no longer available on iOS, she said. \"Walled gardens have existed for decades,\" she said. \"Nintendo has had a walled garden. Sony has had a walled garden. Microsoft has had a walled garden. What Apple's doing is not much different... It's hard to ignore the economics of the industry, which is what you're asking me to do.\"\n\n* Separately on Monday, Google announced it will enforce rules that require app developers distributing Android software on the Google Play Store to use its in-app payment system. The move means that developers who have had customers pay them directly with a credit card for digital content will soon have to use Google\u2019s billing system, which takes a 30% fee from payments.",

        "selftext": "Took out a credit card loan to invest in stock market.\n\nSo, I just did it. My Discover Bank was offering a balance transfer of up to my credit limit which is $19,400 at a 3% fee and no interest until 12 months has passed and the balance hasn\u2019t been re-payed. I took out a $5,000 loan with an upfront fee of $150 or 3%. I plan on investing this money into Apple, Tesla and QQQ with hopes that the return at the very least is 4% on that $5,000 to break even on the loan after IRS takes their taxes on those gains within the following year. I anticipate getting much more than 4% return on that $5,000 within a year which will effectively net me a profit. I\u2019m new to investing and I believe this action is called investing on margin. I chose a $5,000 loan, because the monthly amount to pay it back within a year fits in my budget and I can stomach losing that much money as opposed to going all out with my $19,400 credit limit in which I can\u2019t afford to lose that.

        "selftext": "***\u2018A large market correction, should one materialise, would encourage more professional selling that could overwhelm the buy-the-dip retail investor.\u2019***\n\nThat\u2019s **Mohamed El-Erian, Allianz\u2019s chief economic adviser**, explaining in [an op-ed for the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/e50812f0-51c1-4f8c-9072-21eb0eb8cb9d) how action in the options pits should be taken as a warning by retail investors who have been cashing in on the stock market\u2019s relentless push higher in recent months.\n\n\u201cThe seemingly endless rally\u2026 gives the impression that prices are endorsed and supported by the entire professional investment community,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter all, despite the vocal concerns over valuations having split away from underlying corporate and economic fundamentals, few fund managers have been willing to challenge the market by placing outright shorts. \u201c\n\nHowever, \u201csophisticated investors\u201d are expressing their cautious views with the use of derivatives, and El-Erian says the mom-and-pop types should take note.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to overstate the extent of today\u2019s risk-taking in U.S. financial markets,\u201d he wrote, pointing to the explosive moves in a small number of high-flyers, such as Apple [**AAPL,** **+3.98%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/AAPL?mod=MW_story_quote), Tesla [**TSLA,** **-4.67%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/TSLA?mod=MW_story_quote) and Amazon [**AMZN,** **+1.39%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/AMZN?mod=MW_story_quote).\n\n\u201cMuch of this could be seen as market deepening were it not for one troubling fact: corporate and economic fundamentals have yet to reflect a sustained and convincing recovery from COVID-related damage,\u201d he said. The rebound in consumption is slowing, initial jobless claims are back to the 1 million level for a second straight week, bankruptcies are rising, and, according to El-Erian, it\u2019s looking like these short-term disruptions are about to become long-term scars.\n\n\u201cRather than a well-thought-out bet on the future, stocks reflect many investors\u2019 resolute faith in a consistently favourable and predictable liquidity environment,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is a backdrop anchored by reliable stimulus from central banks.\u201d\n\nOn the surface, the same can pretty much be said for what we\u2019re seeing in the derivatives market, but there\u2019s more to it than just that.\n\n\u201cThe fear of missing out on an unceasing equity rally has increasingly been expressed through call options,\u201d El-Erian said. \u201cThose who would normally short the market on concerns of excessive valuations appear to have no desire to be steamrollered once again by favourable liquidity and the strong \u2018buy-the-dip\u2019 conditioning that comes with that.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that buying call options limits risk and gives traders the ability to take strategic shots at capturing rallies. At the same time, the smart money is hedging bets with downside \u201ctail protection\u201d to guard against the inevitable sharp declines. That\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing the VIX volatility gauge [**VIX,** **-1.09%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/VIX?mod=MW_story_quote) decouple from equities, another sign, according to El-Erian, that retail investors are particularly vulnerable when the sellers take the upper hand.\n\nRead More:   [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-pros-are-getting-ready-for-a-market-crash-retail-investors-not-so-much-top-economist-warns-11598970447](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-pros-are-getting-ready-for-a-market-crash-retail-investors-not-so-much-top-economist-warns-11598970447)",

        "selftext": "I currently have a good chunk of money that I want to invest to hedge against inflation. I have a downpayment and a manageable mortgage and just want to grow my nest egg, so I invest ~40% of it. \n\n1. I have a rental property that most likely will be vacated due to coronavirus once evictions resume. I'm not collecting rent and will have to seek payment once the memorandium is removed. I'm currently paying two mortgages due to this. Because of this, it doesnt make a whole lot of sense to invest in more real estate. \n\n2. Home improvement material costs have risen terribly. Estimates to remodel my home are extremely high (30% higher than Dec) \n\n3. Small businesses are essentially dead in my area. Its been a dream of mine to invest in a resturant but that seems unrealistic for the time being. \n\nDoesn't it seem like the best investment these days is the stock market? I personally have been long since Jan in mostly Apple, but have started to dabble in options. The returns are great and researching companies, etc is fun. I get that he market poses a lot of uncertainity, but so does Housing, Cash, Inflation, etc.",

        "selftext": "A couple of weeks ago, I posted a comment in response to a question about ETFs. This question comes up very often; usually two or three times a week. Maybe more than than.  Several people suggested that it be \"pinned.\"  I obviously cannot do that, however if a mod wants to pin this, feel free to do so.  I did make a few modifications and additions to that comment and for those who haven't gone back to see the changes, I thought I'd post it again here.  Hopefully, this helps people who are interested in an investing approach that is either made up of ETFs or that includes ETFs as a part of their portfolio.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**QQQ** \\- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks. (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft). Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE. (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).\n\n**VOO**/**SPY** \\- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&amp;P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VTG**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**. There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.\n\n**IWF** \\- This is a Russell 1000 indexed fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn't get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different. I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**.\n\n**IWM** \\- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies. Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market. It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.\n\n**VXUS** \\- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas. I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future. XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.\n\n**EEM** \\- iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF - This one is going to have a lot of crossover with **VXUS**. It is an Emerging Markets ETF with a lot of focus on China. It includes Alibaba, Tencent, [JD.com](https://jd.com/), along with companies like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductors. This one should be a solid performer as long as our trade relations with China remain normal.\n\n**EFA** \\- This is another international ETF, but here the focus is mainly on more established companies in Europe and Japan. This is a Large Cap ETF that includes companies like Nestle SA, Roche, Toyota, Novartis and AstraZeneca.\n\n**S*****ector fund ETFs:***\n\n**ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \\- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. **ICLN** is more broad while **TAN** focuses more specifically on solar energy and **FAN** specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of **QQQ** and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies. **QCLN** and **PBW** are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them \"electric vehicle\" funds, as well. No problem if you want to add that, but you'll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.\n\n**ARK** **group of funds:**  **ARKG**, **ARKF**, **ARKK ARKW**, **ARKQ**, **PRNT** and **IZRL**. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.\n\n* **ARKG** \\- Genomic Revolution\n* **ARKF** \\- Fintech\n* **ARKK** \\- Disruptive Companies (broader market)\n* **ARKW** \\- Internet/computer/technology (Telsa is a top holding)\n* **ARKQ** \\- Robotics and artificial intelligence\n* **PRNT** \\- 3D printing technology\n* **IZRL** \\- disruptive companies based in Israel\n\n**XL series of funds**. Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:\n\n* **XLV** \\- Health Care\n* **XLK** \\- Technology\n* **XLI** \\- Industrial\n* **XLY** \\- Consumer Discretionary\n* **XLP** \\- Consumer Staples\n* **XLF** \\- Financial\n* **XLRE** \\- Real Estate\n* **XLU** \\- Utilities\n* **XLE** \\- Energy/Oil\n\n**Cloud Computing** is another sector to consider. Some tickers in that sector include: **WCLD**, **SKYY**, **CLOU**, **BUG** and **XIKT**. Of these **WCLD** has the best 52 week performance. Top holdings in **WCLD** include **ZM**, **PLAN**, **CRM**, **CRWD**, **ZEN**, **WDAY**, **TENB**, **PCTY**, **DDOG**, **BL**. Many of these are likely to also appear in **QQQ**, however, they would be in very small percentages as the Cap on these companies is much smaller.\n\n***Other sector funds include:***\n\n**Health Care:** FHLC, VHT, IYH\n\n**Utilities:** IDU, VPU, FUTY, RYU\n\n**Oil/Energy:** IYE, FENY, VDE\n\n**Consumer Staples:** FSTA, VDC, IECS\n\n**Real Estate:** ICF, USRT, VNQ, PSR, BBRE\n\n**Media/Entertainment:** IEME, PBS, PEJ, IYC\n\n**Gaming/Casinos:** BJK, BETZ, CARZ\n\n**Transportation (including airlines):** JETS, XTN, FTXR, VIS\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n***A nice portfolio might look something like this:***\n\n**20%** \\- Broad market US fund such as QQQ, VOO or IWF\n\n**20%** \\- VXUS or one of the other International ETFs\n\n**20%** \\- IWM - Small/Mid-cap broad market fund\n\n**10%** **each** in four sector funds of your choice\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n*I'm not a financial expert or advisor and this is not financial advice, just an opinion from a random internet person.

        "selftext": "Every week for the past 8 weeks, I've seen non-stop posts about how people are having great FOMO on TSLA. How they wish they had gotten in at $1000, $1300, $1500, $1750, $2000.\n\nEveryone asking about best price to get in, whether it will go higher, etc.\n\nWell, now TSLA is down almost 40% from its ATH post-split. Pre-split it was at $2200. Then there was a 5:1 split, which drove the price to $440, at which point it rocketed up to $500 (or $3000 pre-split).\n\nNow TSLA has cratered all the way to $340 (or $1700 pre-split). Its back at the price point it was at right after the split was announced. Its still high for some people here, but its trading at a discount from its ATH of $3000.\n\nTo all those TSLA FOMO-er's, its time to step up to their conviction. Do you believe in TSLA as the \"company of the future\" that has a valuation potential that can't be captured (ie. ARKK's perspective, and hence their $7000 pre-split price target potential).\n\nAdded fun: AMD, BA, MSFT, AAPL are all hammered right now. Again, these are all stocks that I've seen people have incredible FOMO about missing the August run up. If you genuinely believe these stocks have a future, and are thinking long term (ie. over 1 year holdings), these price points are good entries for a DCA strategy. Basically, all these stocks gave up ALL their August gains, which means if you missed the boat at the end of July, nows the time to get back in because the train came back to the station.\n\nIf you believe the valuations of these stocks are still too high, then feel free to disregard this entire post.",

        "selftext": " \n\n[SoftBank Group Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/9984:JP) shares tumbled in Tokyo trading after reports that the Japanese conglomerate made substantial bets on equity derivatives amid the surge in technology stocks.\n\nSoftBank shares dropped as much as 5.4%, the most on an intraday basis since April. The stock had gained 33% this year before Monday.\n\nThe Financial Times, Wall Street Journal and [Zero Hedge](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QG8ZJIMB2SJO) reported that SoftBank was making massive bets on technology stocks using equity derivatives. The FT labeled SoftBank the \u201cNasdaq whale\u201d that \u201cstoked the fevered rally in big tech stocks,\u201d though it didn\u2019t include details of any trading. The FT later reported that SoftBank is sitting on trading gains of about $4 billion after founder Masayoshi Son\u2019s bets on equity derivatives, citing people with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\n The Japanese conglomerate [said in August](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-11/softbank-returns-to-profit-after-record-losses-on-startup-bets) that it was starting a new unit to trade public securities, pushing beyond its traditional base in telecommunications and private startup investments. Bloomberg [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-11/softbank-is-said-to-target-over-10-billion-in-public-investing) in August that SoftBank was targeting investments of more than $10 billion, perhaps tens of billions, and would use financing structures that would allow the company to avoid showing up in public disclosures of shareholding. \n\n \n\nThe Japanese company\u2019s derivatives strategy has been built over the past few months, the FT cited the people as saying, adding that SoftBank has spent about $4 billion on options premiums focused on tech stocks over that time. SoftBank now has large but unrealized profits, and the trades have been deeply controversial even within SoftBank, the newspaper reported.\n\nSoftBank declined to comment.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that SoftBank spent about $4 billion buying call options on stocks, while also selling call options at higher prices.\n\n \n\nThe idea that options buyers [could drive extreme rallies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-04/option-traders-flex-market-muscles-with-focus-on-very-few-stocks) in technology stocks -- and push benchmark indexes to record highs -- would have drawn skepticism in the past. But as call volumes have exploded in stocks such as Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Tesla Inc., analysts are beginning to embrace the theory. They point out that traders could have outsize influence by concentrating their bets on a narrow set of high-profile names while other trading activity is reduced.\n\n\u201cIn a world where volumes are distorted by the frantic trading of algos, any real order flows may have surprisingly large impact on prices,\u201d Peter Tchir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities, wrote in a note Tuesday. \u201cBy trading options, they leverage their position.\u201d\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-06/softbank-s-4-billion-trading-gains-on-u-s-stock-option-bet-ft](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-06/softbank-s-4-billion-trading-gains-on-u-s-stock-option-bet-ft)",

        "selftext": "I will start off my discsussion using a couple of examples where investors/analysts missed the big picture and the company/stock has proven that they're much more than that.\n\n**Microsoft**\n\n\nIn July 2013, Microsoft stock had the biggest drop of the century after reporting their earnings. The stock dropped because of investors disappointment in the Surface RT laptop. They ignored the biggest elephant in the room that is Windows Azure, now known as Microsoft Azure. Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing division and it has been the major growth driver for Microsoft. Of course, the CEO change from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella helped but Satya's vision was all about cloud computing and it was completely ignored by investors at that time. \n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2013/07/19/as-shares-fall-12-percent-microsoft-experiences-its-biggest-drop-since-2000/\n\n**Apple**\n\nBack in 2018, investors/analysts were focusing on iPhone X sales figures. Warren Buffett saw the big picture. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said long-term investors of Apple\u2019s stock shouldn\u2019t obsess with near-term iPhone sales. \u201cThe idea that you\u2019re going to spend loads of time trying to guess how many iPhone X are going to be sold in a three-month period totally misses the point,\u201d he stated. His big picture was looking at Apple as a brand and its ecosystem\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/30/warren-buffett-says-he-bought-just-a-little-more-apple-recently.html\n\nLook at where Microsoft and Apple stocks were then and where they are trading at now.\n\n\n**Intel**\n\nI'd like to use the same logic for Intel. It dropped 20% after the earnings call last quarter in July. The big picture  Intel's Investors/analysts are  missing is that they are ignoring this industry leader\u2019s methodical transition into higher growth businesses and focusing solely on solvable supply chain problems ( 10 nm/7 nm transistor density issues). I will not be discussing the fact that AMD/NVidia are using 7 nm process and that Intel isn't. Also, the fact that TSMC will be on 5 nm by the time Intel fixes the 10 nm/7 nm node problems. Those are problems I'm well aware of and they have been beaten to death already. There is nothing I can add to that. I will talk about that later on but in the end as not the focal points. What I'd like to talk about and focus on is the data-centric transformation and its MobilEye division.\n\n\n**Data Centric Transformation**\n\nIntel in 2019 pivoted from being a PC centric business to a data centric business. The TAM of this is 250 billion dollars. Revenue in this business group has grown from 42% of revenue in 2015 to 51% of revenue over the TTM. While many business transitions result in periods of low performance, as firms switch focus from declining to new businesses, Intel has managed to grow its revenue by 12% compounded annually over the past four years as it better positions itself for future growth.\n\nhttps://channelbuzz.ca/2019/04/intel-emphasizes-data-centric-transformation-of-company-at-new-xeon-launch-30025/\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/08/18/put-your-chips-on-the-table-with-intel-corporation/#527d69d35951\n\n**Self driving business**\n\nIntel purchased MobilEye in 2015. It is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel . Mobileye has a plan to dominate self-driving. Self driving taxis and cars are a big growth business. MobilEye is in a great position to capitalize on this business. Mobileye says it shipped 17.4 million systems last year. Today, over 40 million cars have Mobileye technology installed, and its products have been selected for implementation in serial production of 313 car models from our 27 OEM partners by 2017 (compared to 36 car models across seven OEMs in 2010). Some of the partners include Volkswagen, BMW, Nissan, Ford. It also has partnered with NIO, a Chinese EV company which people have dubbed the Chinese Tesla.\n\nThe firm\u2019s acquisition of Mobileye strategically positions it to build out its driverless technology business as well. In just three years, Mobileye has experienced rapid growth, with revenue increasing from $210 million in 2017 to $879 million in 2019. Its share of automobile semiconductor sales increased from just 0.5% to 1.9% over the same time. If Mobileye continues taking market share in this fast-growing segment, Mobileye\u2019s could provide a meaningful contribution to Intel\u2019s operations, as it made up just over 1% of revenue in 2019. ResearchAndMarkets.com expects the autonomous/driverless market to grow 18% compounded annually from 2020 to 2025. Intel is positioned to grow with this new market.\n\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/ford-expands-partnership-with-mobileye-intels-autonomous-driving-business/\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2018/10/29/18039216/volkswagen-intel-mobileye-self-driving-ride-hailing-israel-2019\n\nhttps://newsroom.intel.com/news/mobileye-nio-partner-bring-level-4-autonomous-vehicles-consumers-china-beyond/\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/08/18/put-your-chips-on-the-table-with-intel-corporation/#527d69d35951\n\nhttps://www.engadget.com/mobileye-testing-autonomous-cars-germany-104521486.html\n\n\n**PC Business**\n\nThis is the side of Intel most people immediately associate Intel with. Intel\u2019s PC-centric business is not something to write-off. There is still a piece of the PC-centric market where Intel has an opportunity to grow: graphics processing units (GPU). Allied Market Research, expects the GPU market to grow from $19.8 billion in 2019 to nearly $201 billion in 2027 or by 34% compounded annually. For example, Intel is aggressively entering the discreet GPU business, which is about 80% of the current GPU market. The iGPU processors codenamed Tiger Lake just released September 2nd. Intel poached AMD's GPU guy Raja Koduri and nVidia's Tom Peterson. Intel hired engineers and marketing experts from Advanced Micro Devices and NVIDIA, the market leader in the space, to assemble a team to develop and rollout the firm\u2019s Intel Xe GPU.\n\nIntel is also releasing entry level processors. The entry-level processors will be targeted at budget-tier laptops and fanless mini desktops when they launch in early 2021. \n\nhttps://www.nextplatform.com/2020/09/02/intel-puts-its-xe-gpu-stakes-in-the-ground/\nhttps://wccftech.com/intel-jasper-lake-10nm-tremont-atom-cpus-leak-pentium-celeron-skus-2021/\n\n\n**7 nm/10 nm process**\n\nSince I have your attention until here - I'd like to say one final thing about this debacle. Lot of people assume that Intel's problems with this are due to complacency. Its not. Its due to Intel attempting to achieve and do something others have been unable to do, which is the exact opposite of complacency. Intel tried to use GAAFET for 7 nm when TSMC and Samsung warned Intel not to.  Intel was warned by TSMC and Samsung that the GAA-FET technique is too challenging to implement at this point in time, but Intel\u2019s pride and persistence led it to stubbornly try and tackle the GAA-FET problem, until it finally conceded this July.\n\nI agree Intel fucked up here but the point I'm trying to make is that this was not due to complacency as widely believed. Intel has a lot of management problems, hostile work environment etc but complacency is not one of them.  Intel never got complacent about its objectives, but it may have gotten complacent about its approaches, methods, and processes.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/i8qrx4/intel_exemployee_reveals_insider_details_on/\nhttps://www.dvhardware.net/article73530.html\n\n\n**Tl/DR; Post Summary / Post Script** : \n\nI'm perfecty aware that AMD and nVidia are eating Intel's lunch and have better more powerful CPUs/GPUs. However, Intel is much more than that and its other divisions are what will drive future growth. Analysts and investors are missing this big picture.",

        "selftext": "I briefly talked yesterday about Tesla's market cap and how it was absurdly priced and honestly felt like gambling to me. However, APPL is somewhat overlooked as well and I wanted to hear your guys' thoughts on it!\n\nApple's Market Cap as of right now is 2.3 Trillion ([Source](https://ycharts.com/companies/AAPL/market_cap)). On August 20, it was 2 Trillion. It has added 300 billion in about 10 days - without having added any products what soever (primarily due to the stock split). \n\nIn April of this year, it was 1.1 Trillion or so. It has since doubled since that time, so much so that it is the size of the GDP of France ([https://www.statista.com/statistics/685925/gdp-of-european-countries/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/685925/gdp-of-european-countries/))\n\nNow, I am all for Apple devices and services. They make some of the best products ever. They have crazy high margins and once a consumer buys an Apple device, he has to buy other ones due to the seamless integration it provides (biggest selling point). It is now getting in more markets such as India with its' new iPhone SE 2, but I am somewhat skeptical on its' valuation. \n\nI feel like people are buying AAPL due to its security - it has always gone up, so it will always go up - and therefore, it's safe to park their money there. Some are even likening it to Treasury Bonds - that it's better to put your money in AAPL stock because it's *safe.*",

        "selftext": "# Introduction\n\nA common belief is that Tesla is grossly comically overvalued. Most people who express that belief point to Tesla's insanely high price to earnings ratio (P/E) to make the argument.\n\nTesla's current P/E is (1038). A P/E of 1000+ is absurd. To compare with high growth technology companies (FAANG)\n\n* Facebook: 31.36\n* Apple: 34.97\n* Amazon: 122.03\n* Netflix: 82.74\n* Google: 32.21\n* Average: 60.66\n\n[Source](https://www.marketbeat.com/types-of-stock/faang-stocks/)\n\nDespite not enjoying the massive margins of the tech companies, Tesla has a P/E ratio 17 times greater than their average. This is simply ludicrous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Caveats\n\nWhile Tesla's P/E ratio is Prima Facie outrageous, I am of the opinion that it doesn't paint the full picture:\n\n* Tesla's margins per car are around 20%.\n* Tesla's profit margins were 1 - 2%.\n   * This is a very low profit margin that leads to a relatively tiny denominator. Tesla has only just begun to turn a profit, and the margin is expected to grow significantly in future.\n* Tesla's revenue growth over the last 5 years is &gt; 50%.\n   * Tesla's growth is one of the causes of their low profit margins as they're investing a lot in new factories.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe below excerpt sums up my take pretty well:\n\n&gt;Alphabet in 2007 was clearly cheaper than Tesla is today. Alphabet\u2019s price/sales ratio was only moderately below Tesla\u2019s level, but its price/book ratio was much lower. In addition, Alphabet had meaningful profits, which traded at a relatively modest P/E ratio of 50 \u2013 a steep multiple for most companies but not for one growing as rapidly as Alphabet. In contrast, **Tesla has only just begun to turn a profit.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**(Morningstar calculates Tesla\u2019s trailing P/E ratio as 1,111. I report that amount as \u201cnot applicable\u201d because price/earnings multiples that are derived from tiny denominators are misleading. The company\u2019s forward P/E ratio, generated by using its expected profits over the next four quarters, is a more realistic 125.)**\n\n[Source](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/205727/is-teslas-share-price-bonkers.aspx)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTesla's forward P/E ratio of 125 seems more appropriate as a metric of how overvalued (if at all) it is. In that case Tesla's P/E would only be 2x the FAANG average.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Growth\n\nSomething I do find interesting though is the revenue growth rates (over the last five years) of the companies involved:\n\n* Facebook: 41.49%\n* Apple: 7.31%\n* Amazon: 25.81%\n* Netflix: 29.64%\n* Google: 19.65%\n* Average: 24.78%\n* TSLA: 50.36%\n\n[Source (Reuters)](https://www.reuters.com/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTSLA's CAGR (5y) is two times the CAGR average of FAANG stocks. If the higher P/E ratios of FAANG companies represents their growth rate, then Tesla's 2x higher growth rate seems to fit perfectly with their 2x higher forward P/E.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould Tesla be valued comparatively to FAANG companies? That's up for debate. Some people insist that Tesla is just a car company. I don't think that's really true short term, and I doubt it'll be appropriate (from a financial standpoint at least) long term. In addition to their [Energy Business](https://www.tesla.com/energy) and [potential Ride Hailing Network](https://ark-invest.com/analyst-research/ride-hailing/)/[RoboTaxi](https://www.inverse.com/article/54944-autonomous-tesla-how-taxi-service-could-earn-money) [service](https://www.inverse.com/innovation/tesla-robo-taxi-elon-musk-gives-updated-timeline), [Tesla has been selling software upgrades to their customers for a few thousand dollars](https://www.tesla.com/support/upgrades):\n\n* [Acceleration Boost (Model 3): $2,000](https://electrek.co/2019/12/19/tesla-acceleration-boost-model-3-dual-motor/)\n* [Acceleration Boost (Model Y): $2,000](https://electrek.co/2020/09/25/tesla-launches-acceleration-boost-upgrade-model-y/)\n* [Enhanced Autopilot: $4,000](https://electrek.co/2020/09/19/tesla-reintroduce-enhanced-autopilot-alternative-full-self-driving/)\n* [Full Self Driving: $8,000](https://electrek.co/2020/09/19/tesla-reintroduce-enhanced-autopilot-alternative-full-self-driving/)\n\n[Musk has stated that the price for Full Self Driving would rise as it gets better](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1262530589506273280). [Furthermore, it appears that Tesla plans to roll out subscription services for at least its Full Self Driving feature](https://electrek.co/2020/09/20/tesla-full-self-driving-subscription-deadline-enhanced-autopilot/).\n\nIt goes without saying that all the above software upgrades are extremely high margin. They would represent nearly pure profit.\n\nThe above features suggests Tesla already has a fledgling SaaS business model, and that model is likely to grow to become a much larger share of their bottom line going forward.\n\nOf the FAANG companies, I think Tesla is most comparable to Apple (both manufacture and sell hardware for most of their revenue. They sell software services on top of said hardware for better profit margins.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Using Tesla's forward P/E, Tesla's P/E is 3.6 times higher than Apple.\n* Using their CAGR (5y), Tesla's growth rate is 6.9 times higher than Apple. \n\nIf high P/Es are accounting for impressive growth, then Tesla appears to not be overvalued compared to say Apple.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI don't think Tesla is really all that over valued. Not if you think a comparison between Tesla and FAANG companies (especially Apple) is appropriate.",

        "selftext": "Just as the title says the market will not tank. This is a healthy correction but of course when we're so fucking leveraged with short exp calls it feels like the apocalypse. \n\nLet's take a quick look at June 8th. SPY had a face ripping rally of roughly 30% from the previous 3 months. It was a steady climb up with a few dips a long the way. The drop off from June 8th was about 8% over a week. This is widely considered as a healthy correction. This wasn't followed by another rally. No, this is where the Kangaroo market was formed. AMD was trading like KO hovering in the $50's and theta gang was taking Bulls and Bears lunch. \n\nAfter a couple of weeks of this consolidation we started the bull run that was more rigged than Tim Donaghy officiating NBA games. SPY went up 18% in about 2 months with almost no dips along the way. Similar to June 8th, SPY drops about 8% in a week. Again, a healthy correction. Will this be followed by another 18% rally? Probably not. We'll have some big green and red days sprinkled in here and there in the next week or so. But theta is coming from the top ropes to kick our ass. \n\nThere was no major catalyst for this sell off that points to another market crash. Soft bank, tech bubble, elections, etc. All valid arguments but this is still normal compared to a sell off caused by a pandemic. Everyone one wants to be the next Michael Burry, Bill Ackman, and Bobby Axelrod. So keep buying those far OTM puts if you'd like, but the fed will not let SPY drop to $300. Mr. Pump won't let it either. \n\nWe've all gotten bear raped this last week and it hurts. Now's the time to learn to play both sides and start hedging. Having your account wiped out fucking sucks. I'm down 50% this month and I'm sure not letting myself get to 100%. Buy spreads, leaps, and wait for the storm to clear up a bit. \n\nMy positions are:\n\n AAPL 01/15 $130C \n\nSQQQ 10/16 $30C\n\n$WMT 01/15 $150C\n\nFeel free to roast me, inverse me, and tell me I'm wrong.

Anything at the end of the year is highly highly unrealistic.   \n[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/30/opinion/coronavirus-covid-vaccine.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/30/opinion/coronavirus-covid-vaccine.html)\n\n\\-On a daily chart. S&amp;P 500 and QQQ is showing a falling wedge. Bears have been gaining ground aggressively. Although support is holding right now, I dont' believe that this would hold true in the next week. \n\n\\-Our US gov is going to dick around and not give you a stimulus for a bit. (Chances are medium here.)   \nEven if they do it would be modest at best.   \n\n\n\\-We priced in everything for when vaccines does happen. Although I think that's just a dream that we all had. I believe people are going to come into a realization that our economy are getting hit pretty hard. Once people stop living in a tech dream, which I believe already started happening on Sep 4th. Correctly it's holding together, because some people refuse to come out just yet. \n\n\\-Any grounds that tech can gain is already priced in. It will be much harder for bulls to gain ground in current condition. You want bulls to gain ground, some magical vaccine deal gotta come in.... I doubt that. Even if vaccine were to gain ground, the money will flow back into airline, oil, etc. \n\n\\-QQQ was holding ground for earnings, and random tech events. (Apple day, TSLA battery etc). Nothing holding this up next week. Sorry.   \n\n\nMy thoughts:   \n\\-Take your profit aggressively for bulls. (Daily)   \n\\-Bears, hold your shorts.   \n\n\nThis coming week: \n\n  \nMonday: Baby bull day. \n\nTuesday: Consolidation \n\nWeds: Bear \n\nThursday: Bear \n\nFriday Bear",

        "selftext": "Please stop pumping a 3.3 Billion dollar company, that just had price targets jump 75 to 120 (60% price increase) with no underlying changes to its fundamentals. Any google search will bring up a million article giving glowing praises that SNOW can be the next AAPL or MSFT, sure anything can happen, but that's 10 years down the road if at all. \n\nThere are no options yet for this company, so there are few metrics to determine the expected moves in price, but you can do simple DD before making this sort of commitment. \n\nWant to know how you can tell a bad buy from a good buy?\n\n two main categories I use are \n\n## Future Growth Indicators \n\nWhen gauging future growth of a company just ask yourself these questions and try to find answer. \n\n* What are you (the investor) waiting for now that you bought 275 dollars of SNOW?\n * Do they have a roadmap of future services ?\n  * What sort of revenue streams will they be focusing on in this pandemic, will it be investing into growing existing contract or spend liquid cash on advertising? \n  * Will they focus on more research and development? And if so OF WHAT?\n  * How will they KEEP existing revenue streams? Undercutting competition's prices,  what do previous customers think of them vs competitors? \n* What sort of long term plan do they have if any for a growth from a their expected 3.3 billion dollar funding to a now  `70.4 billion` market valuation. \n\n\nThese are questions which are not answered yet, and If you look at the wiki for the company, all of the information will be about their IPO and valuation at launch and none of it will be about any product, service or asset they have because they don't have any. They are an unremarkable company that has potential to carve out a piece of a field only because the field has so much growth potential.  \n\n&gt; Snowflake Inc. is a cloud-based data-warehousing startup that was founded in 2012. It has raised more than $1.4 billion in venture capital, and is based in San Mateo, California. It was publicly launched by Bob Muglia in 2014 after two years in stealth mode\n\n&gt; Revenue\t$264.7 million (2019) Increase 174%\n\n&gt; Net income\t-$348.5 million (2019) Decrease\n\n&gt; Number of employees\t1400 (2019)\n\nThe company's website has glowing reviews of essentially a tailored data solution which is a service many non-publically traded contracting company's already do. Companies get google or amazon engineers to come help to integrations when they move a certain amount of data into their respective cloud environments, its a standard element of a field that again, is still growing a lot, but not unique to this company in any way.  \n\n\n\n## Risk Factors\n\nNormally before getting into an investment you should consider risk to the company. In IPOs everything is laid naked in-front of investors when they set the price targets. On [page 13 of their IPO](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000162828020013381/snowflakes-1a1.htm) they have a whole section listing risk factors, here is  exact excerpts of that section: \n\n\n&gt; We have a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\n&gt; We have experienced net losses in each period since inception.\n\nand \n\n&gt; In addition, our platform currently operates on public cloud infrastructure provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure (Azure), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and our costs and gross margins are significantly influenced by the prices we are able to negotiate with these public cloud providers, which in certain cases are also our competitors.\n\n\n\nYou may also be asking \"but they could get bought out\" \n\nDataware houses are not sexy startups that highly innovate, most of the innovation in that field is with the experts in the field, the direct competitors to SNOW\nActually, google or amazon are more likely to just hire their lead engineers at double pay and get everything they could have wanted from the company. If they were going to buy out this company they would have done it at IPO when shares were 75-85$ and asking for 3.3 billion in valuation. \n\n\nDon't get trapped in a long investment if you can't tie up that sort of liquidity for a very long time. I am sure one day this company will wedge itself into a more serious position in the field, but right now during a pandemic that is largely impacting the state this company is from, \n\n this is not an opportunity unless you are getting it at warren buffet prices.",

Sherman has been selling non-performing assets and have reduced the liabilities by 10% as well, trying to weather the virus event as much as possible for a brick and mortar business. He has reduced their net loss from 816 million a year to 554 a year. Essentially GME can afford to stay open another year and a half as it is right now and still stay open without doing any more changes, but, more shit is coming now that Cohen is on board.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Cash is increasing](https://preview.redd.it/q0u0e652ibp51.png?width=576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=078d01c2fcb81e81c8ee38bcd0eb27bbf2cfe7d5)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[non performing assets being liquidated](https://preview.redd.it/n5q1qh84ibp51.png?width=576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cfbec5f33f83f88c1e1b9a14d18485691c0fda0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[liabilities decreased from last year by 10&amp;#37;](https://preview.redd.it/qn7roih5ibp51.png?width=576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7861e3bee28f3ee4dcd93f9c11f0e17885d8dc5c)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Making this company more profitable \\(although still operating at a net loss\\)](https://preview.redd.it/a6rk4cv7ibp51.png?width=576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2d89c1adb3eb04fc3898c374880d4244042f484)\n\n  \n\n**Short Information** \n\nAugust 2020 Info:\n\nShares outstanding:  65m\n\nAvailable Float:  45m\n\n% Held by Insiders:  1.17%\n\n% Held by Institutions: 152.62%\n\nShares Short (Aug 31, 2020)  57.86M\n\nShort % of Float (Aug 31, 2020)  254.44%\n\nShort % of Shares Outstanding (Aug 31, 2020)  88.74%\n\nShares Short (prior month Jul 31, 2020)  54.52M\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeptember 15th 2020 Info from Morningstar\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[As you can see, their float decreased to 22.7 million.

Despite being made illegal after 2008 financial crisis naked shorting continues due to certain loopholes. \n\nOn 9/24/2020 the **Uptick Rule was triggered and comes into effect for GME on 9/25/2020.** \n\n**Understanding the Uptick Rule**\n\nThe Uptick Rule prevents sellers from accelerating the downward momentum of a securities price already in sharp decline. By entering a short-sale order with a price above the current bid, a short seller ensures that an order is filled on an uptick. The uptick rule prevents MM and short sellers from essentially doing this. \n\n  \n\n**Potential Catalysts:**\n\nShare buybacks\n\n[The last time they bought shares back was in October 2019 and it resulted in a 30&amp;#37; spike in a month.](https://preview.redd.it/exdgc2pajbp51.png?width=576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e2022f97a1e2b3121bdf433fc81c2026a8e1a7c)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[OCT 2019 Spike](https://preview.redd.it/42sschyfjbp51.png?width=197&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6588395574b74d52de511932d9bd964600a5330b)\n\n  \n\n**Ryan Cohen:**\n\nMr. Cohen had previously been CEO of Chewy, which he took from the ground up to the largest online retailer for pet goods. He knows how to get a company profitable and then sell it at a huge profit.\n\nHe's had absolutely nothing to do for 2 years and his other 2 biggest investments before disclosing his shares in GME are in Apple and Wells Fargo, both of which are too big for him to buy outright, but GME only has a marketcap of 654 or so million, so he's in luck. He can buy the whole thing and take it private if he wants to. My personal opinion is that he wants to become CEO. \n\n**Michael Burry:**\n\nMr. Burry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, could decide to buy shares to force the squeeze and then his options and share are worth hundreds of millions. He has enough capital to do this by himself if he wanted. \n\n[https://cheaperthanguru.com/portfolio/michael-burry?order=value](https://cheaperthanguru.com/portfolio/michael-burry?order=value)\n\nBurry's Portfolio is here.

        "selftext": "Turns out Softbank has been pumping all the tech stops with massive billion dollar call options plays forcing market makers to buy the shares in bulk to properly hedge themselves against infinite losses. They even tried to pump TSLA and AAPL AGAIN today before the news officially broke on mainstream media and tried to pump at the end of the day because they were already tens of millions of dollars deep in options that expired today they had bought in the morning. They were unsuccessful because I assume after the news broke anyone with more than two brain cells who knows what this means was dumping hard while they were trying to pump at end of day. Don't believe me? Take a look at the volume they dumped into the 0 DTE options to pump the market, throw these options charts up and see when the volume came in, at the bottom of the drop in the morning so they could squeeze the market makers out by stacking bids pushing price higher and forcing them to cover the options they just sold. Pull out the old calculator and calculate for yourself how much it would've cost someone at the mid-price with that volume to put on these positions, tens upon tens of millions of dollars. This wasn't no regular WSB autism, this was the Japs trying to get revenge for Hiroshima by creating the biggest market wide pump and dump anyone's ever seen. \"Buy the dip faggot\" me all you want buy the truth is everyone including me thought this huge volume and buying was legitimate institutions and investors investing for the long when its really just been a market manipulation feed back loop where all the buying was market makers covering their asses from infinite losses to the calls they sold exactly the same as short squeeze. I wish I had bought TSLA/AAPL/NVDA/NASDAQ/SPY puts before close because I assume come Tuesday everyone and their mom will be tripping over each other to scoop some up as the market corrects back to or below June levels which is about when they started this pumping scheme on the tech stocks. Retail will never touch the stock market again after the blood we will soon see because you know these dumb mfs have been dumping in more money than they can lose at the top on stocks or options and that's about to all go poof. Listen to me or not I don't give a shit, I'm just here so help those smart few avoid the slaughter house and offer free tendies for those who don't already have all their money is soon to be worthless TSLA weeklys.

        "selftext": "In a market with massively inflated valuations across the board (especially so in the technology sector), it feels like a breath of fresh air to see Intel trading at a P/E of less than 10. What I can't quite figure out is *why*.\n\nI know about the 7nm chip delay. I know AMD's 7nm chips are already out. I know Intel has been losing ground to AMD in the desktop market for years now. Yet, the magnitude of these factors has been completely exaggerated by Mr. Market. Intel recently released its 11th generation of CPUs, the 10nm Tiger Lake series, and benchmarks have put their performance up to 30% higher than that of AMD's 7nm chips (that metric comes from the Intel Core i7-1165G7, which isn't even the flagship chip of this generation of processors). However, even if we assume that AMD's 7nm chips are going to finally establish them as the dominant company in the desktop market, so what?\n\nIt may seem odd for me to brush off that particular loss of market share for a company that built itself on desktop CPU sales, but hear me out. Desktop sales have been in decline for years now, with laptop sales almost doubling those of desktops in 2019, and Intel's market share in the laptop market is still over 80%. Intel's management no longer considers it critical to dominate an industry in decline, and I tend to agree with them.\n\nTo offset the loss in desktop market share, Intel has increased its market share in data servers (a rapidly growing sector) to well over 90%. With massive corporations like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google making fortunes off of cloud services, Intel is taking a \"picks and shovels\" approach to profiting off of this trend (during the California gold rush, finding gold wasn't the only way to strike it rich. Many made enormous profits by selling picks and shovels to the miners). When PCs were revolutionizing the world, Intel took this same approach, and in an era when PC sales growth is dwindling, Intel is being proactive about expanding into new high-growth markets.\n\nIntel's current fundamental position has drawn comparisons to that of Apple in 2016, and I agree with the analysis. In 2016, Apple was widely considered to be a company whose upside had run out. They were fighting stiff competition in a saturated, slow-growth market, and their yearly revenue growth had started to reflect that fact. The stock fell out of favor with the market, and at one point fell to a P/E below 10. Any of this sound familiar? It gets better. What the market had neglected to realize was that Apple was still diversifying its product line (the purchase of Beats Audio, the release of the Apple Watch and Apple AirPods, etc.), was still a high-margin earner (net profit margins of \\~21% in comparison to INTC's historical margins of \\~20% and current margins of \\~30%), was beginning to reward shareholders through dividends and massive stock buybacks (INTC pays a safe dividend yielding 2.7% at current prices and is in the process of executing $10 billion worth of share buybacks before the end of this year), was in a great balance sheet position (\\~60% debt/equity in comparison to INTC's \\~50%), and had fantastic ratios (\\~40% ROE compared to INTC's \\~30%).\n\nI'd list Intel's intrinsic value at about $85/share, giving the stock a 40%+ margin of safety at the time of this writing. INTC is currently my second-largest holding, and I'll likely buy more if the share price declines further.\n\nMy primary inspiration for writing this (and the source of lots of my information) was a Seeking Alpha article that I'm not allowed to leave a link to because the auto-mods will remove this post lol. It's titled \"Intel: A Market Leader At A Great Price\" and goes over a lot of the same points as I did, but it's still worth a read imo.\n\nTLDR: INTC's recent price decline is attributable more so to overreaction and irrationality on the market's part than to the company's fundamental situation, which is reminiscent of AAPL's in 2016.",

        "selftext": "Hi, I'm relatively new to this sub, and I don't know jack shit about trading options, shorting, or margins, but after seeing your shitposts, I'm going to teach you how to build a real retirement portfolio after you YOLO all your gains and are ready for big boy pants. The strategy I've used has allowed me to consistently outperform all indexes, even NASDAQ in recent years (100% gain over past two years, never underperformed). As it relates to building wealth over the long haul there's only one true piece of advice that I have in common with you shits and that's that stonks only go up.\n\nI'm the head of engineering at our tech company so I\u2019m pretty familiar with the software industry. My strategy is to combine my domain expertise with buy and hold. I dollar cost average into all my positions, and I\u2019m particularly greedy when the market is down. Because my domain expertise is mostly in tech, this generally leaves me over-exposed in that sector. I try to combat against that by buying in some tech-adjacent companies on the consumer side. \n\nFor example, I am in an industry similar to Square and Shopify, they\u2019re our top competitors, so I buy them. I\u2019m intimate with the makeup of their portfolios, market positioning, and growth opportunities.\n\nWe chose Zoom and Slack at work, and as I use it extensively and have evaluated the competition as part of our vendor selection process, I can argue that they\u2019re the market leaders in what they do and I understand their pricing models. To dive deeper in this, I also know how much we pay and how much more we would be willing to pay (I make the final decision generally), and I can tell you that these companies haven\u2019t even started cost optimization. There\u2019s a lot of upside after the current high-growth period subsides. Yeah yeah we fucking hate when companies raise prices except when you own the goddamn company. Did you idiots know you can raise prices 10% most of the time and only churn out 2% in the short term? You probably didn't.\n\nYou autists have domain expertise as well, think about what software your company uses at work, do they have a POS? Do they have a CRM that is specific to your industry? Is there an incumbent that is publicly traded and they're kicking your ass? Do you use a lot of social media, are you an influencer? Maybe you know about the next big social network, or maybe you know that FB isn't going away anytime soon... you guys know shit and don't even realize it.\n\nAlso, as I stated earlier, my attempt to diversify is by moving into things that are adjacent to my domain expertise which happens to be software. For example, I own a Tesla and purchase clothes from Stitch Fix, and huge consumer of various Disney products and services. Again, I\u2019ve evaluated competitors, and I use the products personally, and I can also argue that my domain expertise gives me a little more insight than the average person on how well software is executed and how much enterprise value that brings the company through innovations such as auto-pilot and the UI/UX of their mobile apps, etc...\n\nI kinda look at PE but mostly just check revenue growth as a lot of the stocks I buy are from companies that aren't yet profitable.\n\nAnd yeah I fucking bought Apple, and Amazon before it was cool.\n\nAfter picking the stocks I don\u2019t go all in. I buy one share or add it to the watch list (dependent upon which brokerage app I use) so I get sense of where it was at a point in time, and by looking each day alongside the rest of my portfolio I get a sense of how it\u2019s changed over time and how they react in relation to my existing portfolio. Then if it dips or goes sideways for a bit, I\u2019ll average in, and then repeat until that stock rises about mid-way in my portfolio by value, then I hold my position there. \n\nAt this point I don\u2019t sell, I don\u2019t care what happens I laugh at 30% dips and buy more maybe. I just don\u2019t do it UNLESS the stock moons, then I try to sell so one stock doesn\u2019t get too far ahead so I have enough dry powder for more positions. It doesn\u2019t work all the time, sometimes you get something like Google and it just kinda sits there, but over the long haul, it works 9 times out of 10. \n\nYou can google them but there are studies that show definitively you almost have to try to fail at buy and hold, over periods of 10 years or more , it\u2019s almost impossible as long as you\u2019re not overexposed in two or three companies. People who bought before the dot com bust, or just before the housing bubble, they\u2019re multiples higher today than where they were.\n\nfuck you guys, I know somehow I'm going to get shit for this post but I think I'm starting to like it here.\n\nyah I know proof or ban, here's one of my retirement accounts: https://imgur.com/a/VaoT0t4\n\nTLDR; Buy companies with good products that you use, average in, hold for years and years, sell bits off when they moon or you're over invested in one stock.",

This confirms that big funds are rebalancing, they are cutting stocks that they think will yield shittier returns in the future. Also confirms my belief about Facebook on a decline, with the whole Social Dilemma, it shines a light on their corrupt evil ways, the users are increasingly aware of it.\n\nTikTok has Zuck shook, a tiny app originally from China almost dethroned FB, they had to resort to lobbying Trump to get rid of it. Long term, FB is running out of place to expand, they can't in China for obvious reasons, which is arguably the biggest and most profitable market. So they resorted to South East Asian countries, but the problem is their middle class is almost none existent, and FB coming in have caused mass civil unrest... their users LITERALLY killing each other off, not good for business. They are DESPERATELY trying to branch out by investing heavy in AI and VR, VR has very little demand right now, mostly a fad until it can achieve insane resolutions, and frankly it's risky and probably won't pay off in the near/medium term. Their AI department cannot compete with Google or Tesla, I think the big boys realize this, that's why they are dumping it the most. Either way, I would not long FB in any of my long term portfolios. Twitter is a much better bet, they are essentially becoming an utility at this point.\n\nTheir domestic market is becoming stale, with China on the rise, having zero access to their market is a huge downside. What's left for them to expand? Africa? Idk much about them, but I'm pretty sure China has first dibs on their market, WeChat will most likely be the social media app of Africa.\n\nYou gotta ask yourself, where is FB going to find growth? Take a look at Apple, they penetrated pretty much every market on earth, and their devices are becoming less and less appealing with each iteration. They need a breakthrough in hardware technology to get on the next wave, therefore, their only move is services, it took them 10 fucking years to realize this... they need to squeeze more dollars from their existing customers instead of finding new users. Facebook doesn't have that luxury, it doesn't have the cult following Apple has, Apple has a much stronger moat than Facebook, because while Facebook has network effects on its side, it will also be its downfall. Network effects can work negatively too, when another app becomes popular, it uses network effects to growth exponentially, and FB's market share will shrink exponentially. Its the reason why some social media platforms rise as quickly as they die, MySpace, YikYak, Tumblr. How much more fucking advertisement can they should you? How many more dollars can they squeeze from their data that is starting to lack diversity? How much more is their data gonna be worth by recording your 1020023rd like on the latest Instagram Thot's 5226th ass picture? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Facebook's reign is outnumbered, they are on a decline, no more exponential growth. I wouldn't short them, but I would not hold their shares long term in my portfolios, and the big funds aren't holding it either.",

This behavior is  common during market recoveries throughout history. The increase in  darkpool buying supports the idea that we are either at the bottom of  this dip, or nearing it, based on historical DIX numbers during pull  backs and corrections. This is encouraging, perhaps its time to start looking for entries.",

Buffet Buys Silver ( silver protects your money, it\u2019s not really like gold since your not investing in it for it to potentially go up, but more so to protect your funds)\n\n2. Banks are about to get played like a motherfucker. I find it funny that the major hand holding shares in all of these companies, are banks and the US government. This is about when people realize all the quantitative easing in the world can\u2019t save you. If no one wants to / will buy your shares... their worthless (anyone catch that SoftBank shit)\n\n3. (Who has a mortgage) I find it hilarious there\u2019s no more stimulus for consumers. Anyone catch the fact hundreds of companies filed for bankruptcy? and there\u2019s a law preventing banks from going after said companies? how about the fact that 28% of property owners didn\u2019t pay their mortgage in august, and starting September banks can start giving out foreclosures? Luckily I\u2019m renting and pay my bills\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude05\n\n4. Tech sector starts to fall, Nasdaq futures drop, and the dow goes up? Let\u2019s be honest we all know that tech stocks are overpriced like a motherfuker. My theory for this is simple af, nothing else was  operating, look at American Airlines.... meanwhile everyone is at home using all these digital products, and these software companies, that really only have to create a product once and can charge for using it seemed to be a very good investment when everyones forced to work from home. \u201con paper\u201d.\n\n\nGiven those 4 things if you use your last couple brain cells you can see were on the verge of some ugliness, and I\u2019m expecting a pretty significant tech pullback and a boom in commodities and sectors like energy and manufacturing. Banks are going to start wanting their money, and the only people they can really go after is mortgage owners unless the fed starts printing more money again.\n\nThat being said my first play is: \n\n30 SLV call @25.5 9/11/2020\n\nSo this is the play for me rn, it\u2019s cheap, and if tech stocks go up or down, this will go up due to uncertainty in the market, and if the fed prints even more money then we\u2019re super good lol.\n\n5 VSLR puts @23 9/18/2020, \n\novervalued solar stock that\u2019s not getting money if people don\u2019t pay their mortgages (solar contracts)\n\n5 aapl puts @110 9/11/2020 \n\nSo I\u2019m a lil bit uncertain about this one because I can see it rallying through Wednesday because of the perceived lower price and then dropping down sub 110 into next week, but I\u2019m gonna risk it for the biscuit cuz Nasdaq futures are already lower and I\u2019m expecting another sector wide drop again Forsure.\n\nYou may now proceed to roast me.",

        "selftext": "\u2018A large market correction, should one materialise, would encourage more professional selling that could overwhelm the buy-the-dip retail investor.\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s Mohamed El-Erian, Allianz\u2019s chief economic adviser, explaining in an op-ed for the Financial Times how action in the options pits should be taken as a warning by retail investors who have been cashing in on the stock market\u2019s relentless push higher in recent months.\n\n\u201cThe seemingly endless rally\u2026 gives the impression that prices are endorsed and supported by the entire professional investment community,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter all, despite the vocal concerns over valuations having split away from underlying corporate and economic fundamentals, few fund managers have been willing to challenge the market by placing outright shorts. \u201c\n\nHowever, \u201csophisticated investors\u201d are expressing their cautious views with the use of derivatives, and El-Erian says the mom-and-pop types should take note.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to overstate the extent of today\u2019s risk-taking in U.S. financial markets,\u201d he wrote, pointing to the explosive moves in a small number of high-flyers, such as Apple AAPL, +3.98%, Tesla TSLA, -4.67% and Amazon AMZN, +1.39%.\n\n\u201cMuch of this could be seen as market deepening were it not for one troubling fact: corporate and economic fundamentals have yet to reflect a sustained and convincing recovery from COVID-related damage,\u201d he said. The rebound in consumption is slowing, initial jobless claims are back to the 1 million level for a second straight week, bankruptcies are rising, and, according to El-Erian, it\u2019s looking like these short-term disruptions are about to become long-term scars.\n\n\u201cRather than a well-thought-out bet on the future, stocks reflect many investors\u2019 resolute faith in a consistently favourable and predictable liquidity environment,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is a backdrop anchored by reliable stimulus from central banks.\u201d\n\nOn the surface, the same can pretty much be said for what we\u2019re seeing in the derivatives market, but there\u2019s more to it than just that.\n\n\u201cThe fear of missing out on an unceasing equity rally has increasingly been expressed through call options,\u201d El-Erian said. \u201cThose who would normally short the market on concerns of excessive valuations appear to have no desire to be steamrollered once again by favourable liquidity and the strong \u2018buy-the-dip\u2019 conditioning that comes with that.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that buying call options limits risk and gives traders the ability to take strategic shots at capturing rallies. At the same time, the smart money is hedging bets with downside \u201ctail protection\u201d to guard against the inevitable sharp declines. That\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing the VIX volatility gauge VIX, -1.09% decouple from equities, another sign, according to El-Erian, that retail investors are particularly vulnerable when the sellers take the upper hand.\n\n\u201cIt would take a big shock for markets to move significantly lower \u2014 such as a renewed sharp economic downturn, a considerable monetary or fiscal policy mistake, or market defaults and liquidity accidents,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut should such a move occur, the likelihood of further market turmoil would be high, especially given the current lack of a short base to buffer the downturn. This exposes small retail investors to big potential losses.\u201d\n\nNo sign of the dying of the bull Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.75%, Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% and S&amp;P 500 SPX, +0.75% moving higher. \n\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-pros-are-getting-ready-for-a-market-crash-retail-investors-not-so-much-top-economist-warns-11598970447?mod=home-page",

        "selftext": "I received a call a week before Apple's split 4:1 asking whether they should buy shares for their long term account before the split or after the split. I gave my canned stock split pitch about how the value of the company is the same before and after the split, that you own the same (tiny) percentage of shares, etc. If one is buying as an investment, then it doesn't really matter when you buy. An investor should generally put his or her money to work as soon as possible and then wait. If you want to minimize potential regret, one can divide their capital into equal pieces and buy on a fixed schedule (25% on the first of the next 4 months, for example).\n\nBack to AAPL - in case you missed it (and if you're reading this, you haven't), since they announced on the stock split on the 30th, AAPL shot up leading into the split. Shortly after it gave back much of those gains as most of the market has dropped:\n\nFull disclosure I'm long AAPL and will probably add a few shares tomorrow as part of my mechanical buying of it each month - building a long term investment in the name. It is one of the names I trade frequently on my watch list, but I don't see a lot of good bullish options in the name right now. Let's break down a couple common option strategies, an example idea for each, and an explanation on why I'd avoid it for the time being:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t4gk7yq27zm51.png?width=501&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ac495a7d884ccdd4da12f09ed9b6808b4020ef3\n\n**Buy a call**\n\nThe most straightforward bullish option position. If we're bullish near-term, we could look at the October 16th, at-the-money call. The 112.5 strike can be purchased for 6.45 at the ask. It is expensive. That's almost 6% of the underlying for an option expiring in 33 days. Note also that the Implied Volatility remains high compared to the long term values in AAPL. Pre-COVID, AAPL hadn't hit a 50 vol since the large sell-off at the end of 2018 (Christmas Eve).\n\nOne could go further in time to the January ATM call and pick up the 112.5 strike for 11.25. That gets you almost 4x as long for AAPL to go up for less than 2x the price. If I had to buy a call, I would go longer term, but again, the Implied vol is still about 44% out in January and we'd be spending 10% of the price of the underlying - I'd rather buy 10 shares.\n\n**Sell a put**\n\nIf IV is high, we should simply sell a put, right? Let's look at the October 16th, 100 put. It can be sold for about $2. This is a decent return - about 2% in a little over 1 month. I still wouldn't sell it though.\n\nTake a look at historical volatility. AAPL is currently moving more than the options have priced. I try to avoid selling options in these scenarios. HV is at 53% and the option we'd sell is at 48%.\n\n**Summary**\n\nIt is OK to Not take a trade if the conditions aren't favorable. We've had a big rally in tech with Increasing Implied Volatility - which isn't the norm. We've had people bidding up names that split (AAPL, TSLA), with no change to the underlying fundamentals. Other than the few shares of AAPL I'll buy for my long term account, I'm going to sit out on AAPL options trades for a little while until the name stabilizes or the vol conditions become more favorable. There are plenty of other good opportunities in the market in the meantime.\n\nYes, I know stocks only go up and the above is basically guaranteeing a bottom in AAPL... other thoughts/comments are appreciated!",

        "selftext": "I've obsessively been doing DD on F45 (merging into CRSA; warrants: CRSAW) since early July. I've spent at least 50-100 hours picking it apart from every angle, and I've been dollar cost averaging into the shares and warrants for several weeks. **I have personally concluded that this is the most underrated/undervalued SPAC merger because people have not actually looked into it.**\n\nThe company is a cash cow that is rapidly growing an imposing global brand with an innovative and scalable model of high intensity interval training studios that use a patented software system to deliver a new daily HIIT workout to every global location via digital monitors on the studio walls. I think that the vast majority of investors have skipped past looking below the surface based on the reasonable assumption that \"gym + covid = bad\". I encourage you to take a few minutes to look below the surface here and make sure you're not missing a significant opportunity. I believe it is.\n\nThe amount of info I could type out is more extensive than most would care to read, so I figured I'd break the key points down into a list of my favorite things about F45 as an investment opportunity. Additionally, I highly encourage you to spend 5-10 minutes reading the investor presentation hosted on Crescent Acquisition's website [here](https://www.crescentspac.com/assets/docs/CRSA%20Analyst%20Day%20Presentation%20(8.6.20).pdf). They did an excellent job of presenting the product, business model, financials, etc.\n\nI've accumulated a lot more information than I could lay out here, so feel free to ask any questions and I'll get to all of them as soon as possible. Here are ten of the reasons that I believe CRSA is the most underrated/undervalued SPAC with an upcoming merger:\n\n# 1. It\u2019s growing 40-50%+ per year.\n\nThe charts below show F45's revenue and EBITDA growth over the past few years, as well as projections for this year and next (see point #2 as a caveat to the projections, because their franchise sales numbers this year have actually proven significantly better than forecast here, which should also have a positive effect on revenue).\n\nAs a franchise company, F45 makes most of their money from selling franchises and collecting monthly franchise fees. New franchises pay an establishment fee of up to $50k and purchase $120k in proprietary equipment from F45. Once opened, the franchises pay a $2500/month franchise fee.\n\n*(Note that the difference between \"Franchises Sold\" and \"Total Studios Open\" on the chart below seems to primarily be a matter of the lag between a franchise agreement being signed and the franchise actually opening for business, rather than failed franchises which is what I thought initially.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zq6wclz3ntk51.png?width=2150&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7eb89ae1b10e54fece71cb988d20216cbd002821\n\nThe slide below is interesting as well. This isn't from the investor presentation, but rather a March '19 franchise sales presentation.\n\nThe item that intrigues me the most is that F45 surpassed Crossfit as the largest gym network in Australia within just four years of launching their first location...this is explosive growth, and the United States has now overtaken Australia as their largest and fastest growing market. Their product is clearly resonating with people, even if you've never heard of it yourself (as I hadn't).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k5mvpqijntk51.png?width=2546&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a9ba503522252b2b0dcc5390b46e543aae3d264\n\n# 2. Covid has not been nearly the significant setback that was feared.\n\nAs mentioned in the first point, the 2020 projections above have actually proven to be significantly conservative, which should increase 2021's projections as well.\n\nAs you can see in the chart in the first point, F45 was projecting new franchise sales this year of 174 due to Covid. In their August 6, 2020 [8K filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1723648/000119312520212102/d48204d8k.htm), they provided a significant update to this, but they haven't updated the projections slide to reflect the latest bullish information.\n\nTheir 8/6 update stated that they sold 244 franchises so far in 2020 through July, including 124 in June/July alone. If you extrapolate out the monthly new franchise sales below, you can infer that they'll likely end up selling over 400 franchises this year, assuming the recent sales success continues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bdw786b5ntk51.png?width=2038&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=532cba1aea8dbf116e7a80493b3f59afb2ecdecf\n\nThe 8/6 update further stated that 50 new studios opened from June through early August, and that 78% of the pre-covid franchise network was re-opened as of August 3, 2020 and that the median revenue per studios opened for seven weeks was back to 88% of pre-covid levels. Keep in mind that F45 makes their money from franchise fees, so the main factor is that studios are open and hopefully paying the full fee.\n\nLastly on this point, CRSA is valuing F45 at less than half of their expected pre-covid IPO price. Robert Beyer, executive chairman of CRSA and founder of Crescent Capital Group ($28bn in AUM) had this to say on the conference call: \"*F45 has a steep growth trajectory, proven over seven years of opening more than 1,200 and selling nearly 2,000 franchises in more than 50 countries. The company has been profitable since inception, with extremely high cash flow margins, not only for the company but for its franchisees....This is simply one of the most exciting public market stories we\u2019ve heard, with a valuation that is 30% to 50% below its peers and less than half the expected price of its previously planned IPO, which was interrupted by the worldwide lockdown only a few short months ago.\"*\n\n# 3. The business is successfully scaling globally (very quickly).\n\nOne of the most intriguing things to me about F45's growth and the investment opportunity is that F45 is proving that their model is scalable around the globe, something that most other fitness franchises have not achieved.\n\nThe company's franchise sales team has grown from 6 to 34 members since 2019, with 18 in the Americas, three in Europe, three in the Middle East &amp; Africa, and five in Asia, as well as five who cater to college, corporate, and military (F45s are rapidly popping up in college rec centers and soon on military bases).\n\nThe chart below shows open and soon-to-open locations around the world. It's hard to tell on this map, but I believe it's 776 in the Americas (mainly USA), 124 in Europe, 8 in Africa, 200 in Asia, and 572 in Australia. (The company started in Australia and quickly penetrated that market. The fastest growth now is in the United States.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/66dqonw6ntk51.png?width=672&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1676d7873c6db4d0122b831ddac7793a2c254c9b\n\n# 4. The celebrities who use, support, and invest in F45 make the brand sexy.\n\nMark Wahlberg is a key investor in F45 and will be on the board after the merger. Hugh Jackman trained for his role as Wolverine in the X-Men film series at F45. Other celebrities who use or have used F45 include Nicole Kidman, Channing Tatum, Nicole Ritchie, Sam Smith, Ricky Martin, Joel Madden, Russell Crowe, Teri Hatcher, and more.\n\nNo offense at all to Planet Fitness and PF members, but I don't think a lot of celebrities are members there.\n\n# 5. The franchisees pay for the company\u2019s growth.\n\nThe company requires very little capital to fund their growth because the franchise establishment and equipment fees fund the buildout of each new F45 location and thus fund the company's growth. Warren Buffett has long preached that the best investments are companies that require very little capital to run their business. This is a prime example.\n\nIn fact, the company doesn't really even need the capital from this merger. They've suggested how they may use it, and I'll get to that in a later point (it's bullish).\n\n# 6. The company is easy to understand and follow.\n\nYou don't have to be a fitness nut or in the fitness industry to understand and follow this investment (I'm not a fitness nut or in the industry). Their business model is very simple. They make most of their money from franchise fees, as well as equipment packs.\n\nThe main metric to watch is the number of franchises sold, as you can assume that each new franchise will add the following revenue: $50k establishment fee (there seems to be wiggle room with this depending on the deal), $120k equipment purchase, and $30k+ in annual recurring revenue from the monthly franchise fee. There's also a $25k franchise renewal fee after five years, and some other fees as well, including the anticipation of equipment pack refreshes. *(Note on page 49 of the* [*investor presentation*](https://www.crescentspac.com/assets/docs/CRSA%20Analyst%20Day%20Presentation%20(8.6.20).pdf) *how this revenue is recognized...the establishment fee is amortized over ten years, so each franchise sold will add approximately $5k to revenue for the ten years after it's sold from the establishment fee, in addition to the monthly franchise fee.)*\n\n# 7. The company has some level of moat from patents.\n\nF45 holds patents for the innovative technology it uses to power the studios and the global network: [https://patents.justia.com/assignee/f45-training-pty-ltd](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/f45-training-pty-ltd). It is currently [actively pursuing](https://www.ausleisure.com.au/news/f45-training-takes-legal-action-against-body-fit-training-over-alleged-patent-infringement/) a case against an upstart in Australia that is using a model that is allegedly similar.\n\nI believe that F45 has tapped into a unique way to scale a HIIT training business into a global franchise model, and the success of that model is evident in the number of franchises being sold globally. It's great that they have a certain level of protection from others replicating this model. Assuming the patents prove defensible, it would be hard for competitors to replicate their success in their largest markets.\n\n# 8. The product is so good that its members are often described as a cult.\n\nIf you search articles and social media, you'll often hear F45 described as a cult. Publicly traded companies with a cult following often do very well, such as Apple and Tesla.Here's the first paragraph of a 2020 GQ UK [article](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/lifestyle/article/f45-challenge-8-week-body-transformation-review) about F45: \"Whenever a friend of mine has suddenly walked back into my life looking better than they\u2019ve ever looked before, the reason was always the same: F45. The cult exercise class, which can be found nearly anywhere in the world, just seems to work for people.\"\n\n# 9. The potential for further growth is large enough that this is likely just in the first inning.\n\nF45 estimates that the franchise potential in their existing markets is 25,000, based on the number of studios per capita in Australia. This seems reasonable to me because F45 was able to get to basically a 1:1 parity with Crossfit locations in Australia within seven years. F45 is arguably a much better structured / operated business than Crossfit (from a capitalistic investment perspective), which is why I think they were able to achieve a similar number of locations in Australia so quickly.\n\nBased on informal polling of friends and chatter on the internet, it seems evident to me that very few people in the United States have heard of F45. However, if you live in a small city or larger and search your city on the locations map on their website, chances are that there's a studio open or opening soon near you.\n\nSince each studio only needs a few hundred members to operate profitably and can't accommodate many more, it's been quietly growing and thriving, unnoticed by the majority of people. As the number of locations grows to accommodate more people, I think it's highly likely that you'll be hearing about it a lot before long. If you know someone who does Crossfit, chances are you'll know someone who does F45 soon.\n\nAs an addendum to the paragraph above, if you've ever read \"One Up on Wall Street\" by Peter Lynch, I believe that this is a perfect example of the type of opportunity he describes. It's a rapidly growing, profitable company with a great product and a business model that's easy to understand, but that most people have not yet heard of. Unless some unanticipated force somehow stops them dead in their tracks (as Covid appears to have failed to do), the growth is likely on enough of a trajectory to where this will be a hot stock before too long.\n\n# 10. Corporate owned franchises will accelerate growth further.\n\nI mentioned earlier in point five that F45 has suggested how they may use the company's merger cash, given that they don't need it for the current growth. They've suggested that they may acquire existing franchise locations or establish new company-owned locations.\n\nThis is bullish because it will significantly accelerate their revenue growth. Instead of grossing \\~$30k in franchise fee revenue each year per location, company-owned locations will likely contribute $275k-$500k in revenue per year. Planet Fitness has followed a similar strategy to this...they've turned to pursuing company-owned locations which has accelerated their revenue growth.\n\n\\----------------------------------\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The warrants (CRSAW) have an exercise price of $11.50 and the company can redeem them after the common shares (CRSA) have traded above $18 for 30+ days. The warrants were selling for $0.60-$0.65 last week. Warrants purchased at $0.60 would return over 900% if the common shares climb higher than $18 within five years of the merger. Based on F45's rapid growth, I believe that the probability of shares going from $10 to $18 in the next five years is high.\n* As of July 15, the net asset value per share of the common stock was $10.15. That means that if you're able to buy the shares for less than $10.15, your risk is extremely low because you could technically redeem your shares for $10.15 in cash around the merger closing. (However, hopefully the F45 story gets out there and it's no longer trading below the NAV by the merger closing.)\n* Investor relations said a week or two ago that they're awaiting SEC approval of the proxy statement and then they'll send it out with the shareholder vote date. They said that they now expect closing to be \"late Q3 / early Q4\".\n* Note that there is risk with the warrants, in part because if the merger were somehow derailed, they could lose some or all of their value. However, the compensation for that risk right now is that the return potential on them is massive (as outlined above). The main risk for the merger falling through seems to be the possibility that too many shareholders redeem their shares. In that case, Crescent has the option to add more cash to complete the merger. I personally believe that they would do that. They seem to fully believe in F45 as an investment, and they have a vested interest in the merger going through and then the shares doing well. They announced the merger in June, well into Covid, so this wasn't affected by the Covid surprise. F45's franchise sales have been solid despite Covid, as outlined earlier.\n\nI want to reiterate that I have a long position in both CRSA and CRSAW. I hope to realize the maximum profit on the bulk of my warrant position by selling or exercising if/when the common shares are trading above $18 (based on the company's ability to redeem the warrants once the shares trade above $18 for 20 days over a 30 day period).\n\nLike I mentioned, I'll try to answer any questions to the best of my ability as soon as possible in the comments below.\n\nNone of this is investment advice, simply an outline of the due diligence that made me highly bullish on F45. Do your own research--there's great further reading in the documents on this [page](https://www.crescentspac.com/investor-relations.html) of Crescent's website. In particular, the [investor presentation](https://www.crescentspac.com/assets/docs/CRSA%20Analyst%20Day%20Presentation%20(8.6.20).pdf) I mentioned earlier does an excellent job of laying out the product, business model, financials, etc in an easily digestible way.",

I know we have a few upcoming catalysts - \n\n1. iPad and Apple Watch event, which is coming soon apparently.\n2. iPhone 12 launch event, which is apparently its first 5g phone, so that should be exciting.\n\nTSLA was another stock that underwent the split, but I think AAPL has better fundamentals, and looking at their business model, I think they should still go up in the near future.\n\nSorry I don't have any DD or anything, but I wanted to check on how others are planning on playing AAPL in the next months.

        "selftext": "Hey guys this week could be very pivotal point in the stock market so I\u2019ve been doing my research and getting ready for this coming week and for options traders I found the 3 most important stocks announcing earnings this week.\n\nADBE-\n\nIf you don\u2019t know AAPL owns ADBE or supposedly 15% of it so let say ADBE has great earnings next week but then all of a sudden institutions start selling the hell out of it.. what does this mean for the rest of the market? You probably think it means nothing because it\u2019s just ADBE right? But you are actually wrong. Knowing that AAPL owns adbe it would mean that if they take out of adbe they will also start selling aapl.. it\u2019s a very simple correlation and you know what happens when institutions take out of AAPL right? The market drops because aapl has large stake in the indices and it will be a leading tech stock falling meaning that other tech stocks will follow lead. So just when people are thinking the market drop could be over and that tech can\u2019t sell of any harder it actually can and it depends a lot on adobe and how it reacts after earnings.\n\nFDX- fedex is up 100% in just the last 3 months and almost 300% since the crash.. it hasn\u2019t had a down week in about 7 weeks I think.. crazy growth.. why? Because they are expecting great earnings obviously.. accelerated growth and good guidance are why stocks go up but we all know that the stocks that have soared in these market conditions have not done well after earnings.. for example look how AMZN,TSLA,SHOP, ZM, PTON reacted after earnings.. they all dropped hard and despite their AMAZING earnings.. the reason is because the great earnings are already priced into the stock and they are already incredibly valued so when the great earnings come out it is just not enough to justify the crazy new price leading to the stock being overvalued after earnings causing it to drop. I see the same happening with FDX this next week or at least an extremely high probability\n\nCBRL- this is a restaurant stock that trades at about $130 a share and ur prob thinking what the fuck is CBRL? Don\u2019t worry I didn\u2019t know either but the little details abt the company are not what\u2019s important.. what is important is how it will react after earnings and knowing that it is a RESTAURANT stock if we look back at some restaurant stocks post earnings like MCD, CMG you will notice that these also reversed by about 6%. On cmg we bounced at open and then dropped 70 points.. converted into percentage it would not be unreasonable to see CBRL bounce and form this double top and then drop 8 points after leading to some very profitable options day trades.. I explain the analysis over all these stocks and their earnings in detail if you want to see how I explain it over the actual charts but I hope this is helpful for anyone who wanted to keep track of the earnings this week and on top of that there is actually some significance and domino effect relying on how ADBE will react.. make it a great week guys let me know if you have any questions or if I\u2019m forgetting any major earnings coming out this week\n\n[https://youtu.be/zSX5hw\\_NNEI](https://youtu.be/zSX5hw_NNEI)",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 14th, 2020.\n\n# **Investors will look to the Fed to soothe the market next week, but that may be a tall order  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/11/investors-will-look-to-the-fed-to-soothe-the-market-next-week-but-that-may-be-a-tall-order.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Markets are looking to the Federal Reserve to be a soothing force when it meets in the week ahead, but stocks could remain choppy if the central bank disappoints and as investors focus on the election and the economic recovery.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting is expected to end Wednesday with minor tweaks to its statement and some clarity on how it plans to use forward guidance. The Fed also updates its economic and interest rate outlook, including forecasts for 2023 for the first time.\n*****\n&gt; But Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at Prudential Financial, said the stock market could easily be disappointed because the Fed is unlikely to offer more clarity on monetary policy, such as plans for bond buying.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is concerned the Fed is not going to give us explicit readings on their plans for monetary policy,\u2033 she said. The Fed\u2019s extraordinary policies have been an important factor behind the stock market\u2019s 50% surge from the March 23 low, and it\u2019s also seen as a major factor limiting the depth of the market\u2019s sell-off.\n*****\n&gt; Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the Fed is not likely to tweak much and it continues to buy $80 billion a month in Treasurys. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll do anything to the markets either way,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were volatile in the past week, falling hard, rallying, falling and rallying again. That left the S&amp;P 500 with a weekly decline of about 2.5%, its worst week since June. The harder hit Nasdaq was down about 4.1% for the week, its worst weekly decline since March. The quadruple expiration of options and futures at the end of the coming week could add to the volatility.\n*****\n&gt; Bank of America strategists said the bond market is watching the Fed for any balance sheet adjustments and the changes to its forward guidance, which includes the Fed\u2019s recent tweak in its inflation policy. The Fed changed its policy of focusing on a target inflation rate to an average rate, meaning it may not tighten policy if inflation overshoots its 2% target.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe see risk the rates market is underwhelmed by the guidance provided by the Fed, which would support higher back-end rates and a steeper curve,\u201d the Bank of America strategists noted. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield slid in the past week, touching 0.67% Friday, and it could move higher, meaning bonds may sell-off, if the Fed does not clarify policy around its bond buying program.\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said the stock market is hoping for a dovish Fed. \u201cThe market needs that now because fiscal policy is going nowhere,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; BTIG strategist Julian Emanuel said the market could focus on the fact that Congress failed to make headway on fiscal stimulus, if the economic data begins to disappoint.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales for August are expected Wednesday morning, as the Fed meets. They are expected to rise by 1%, and that should be an important look at whether the lack of enhanced unemployment benefits, which expired July 31, impacted consumer spending. Among other things, Republicans and Democrats could not agree how to replace the $600 weekly payment to the unemployed.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cDepending on the polls and the economic data, the probability of stimulus rises and falls,\u201d said Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOur view is that next week is just going to be lots of back and forth with the potential for a further extension of the range for the downside, if the political narrative gets more inflamed,\u201d said Emanuel. Emanuel expects the market to remain choppy and fall further into the month of October, as investors worry about the uncertainty around the presidential election.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s meeting this week is its last before the election, and analysts expect Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to sound reassuring that the Fed will do whatever it takes to support the economy. Powell holds a briefing after the meeting Wednesday, and he is expected to also be asked about the potential for higher inflation. The Fed has said it is more concerned about disinflation, but recent inflation data has been hotter than expected, though still well below 2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere is a tug of war between those who say buy chips now because inflation is moving higher, versus those why are saying deflationary forces are still weaving their way into the economy,\u201d said Krosby.\n*****\n&gt; Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said he expects the Fed to sound reassuring but it\u2019s not likely to discuss a target for bond purchases or the yield curve controls some investors were hoping for. Yield curve control would mean the Fed would try to manage interest rates by targeting its purchases of specific Treasurys. For instance, it may focus on trying to keep longer duration yields lower, and buy the 10-year.\n*****\n&gt; Chandler also noted the Fed\u2019s $7 trillion balance sheet has recently declined by about $100 billion from its peak, and its bond purchases are falling behind the European Central Bank.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMy sense is the Fed is going to keep saying it\u2019s not worried about inflation. Its bigger worry is downside risks. They\u2019ll repeat their call for fiscal stimulus which after this week seems less likely,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Chandler said the stock market could remain choppy in the coming week, but he does not expect a sharp selloff. The dollar could decline, if the Fed sounds dovish, and that is a positive for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI don\u2019t think a 10% pullback [in Nasdaq] has caused enough pain to have people capitulate. This is just an ordinary correction, and we\u2019re going to make new highs,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/N5HwCxp.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/jr7e4gT.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/z7gtiCt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/5tgPKm6Y/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LUUHMDE.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CWgjO92.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/c37y9mp.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Eau1B5A.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/Mp84zhth/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SHieVRq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/fTBYdV6v/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/05GY8WnF/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/qMk8gsZR/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election Charts You Need To See: Part 1\n\n&gt; First off, our thoughts go out to everyone who was impacted by the tragic events of September 11, 2001\u201419 years ago today. It is a day to reflect and remember those who were lost.\n\n&gt; One of the top requests we\u2019ve had here at LPL Research is for more charts on the election. Over the next week, we will share some of our favorite charts on this very important subject.\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s how the S&amp;P 500 Index performs under various presidents and congressional makeups. The best scenario has historically been a Democratic president and Republican Congress, while a Republican president and Democratic Congress has been the weakest.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Building on this, a split Congress historically has been one of the best scenarios for investors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The best scenario under a Republican president is a split Congress, a potential positive for 2020 that has played out after the massive reversal in the stock market since March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Looking at the four-year presidential cycle shows that stocks haven\u2019t been down during a year the president was up for a re-election since FDR in the 1940s, another bullish tailwind for 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s another look at this, as stocks historically have done much better when there isn\u2019t a lame duck president.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Active Managers Do an About Face\n\n&gt; The National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) has an index which tracks the exposure of its members to US equity markets. Each week, members are asked to provide a number that represents their exposure to markets. A reading of -200 means they are leveraged short, -100 indicates fully short, 0 is neutral, 100% is fully invested, and 200% indicates leveraged long. Two weeks ago, in our Bespoke Report, we highlighted the fact that the exposure index had moved to one of the highest levels in its 15-year history. Now, just two weeks later, these same active managers have reigned in their exposure considerably as this week's reading dropped from just under 100 to 53.1.\n\n&gt; This week's drop was the second-largest one week decline in the index's history and just the 10th time that the index lost more than a third (33 points) in a single week. The most recent occurrence was back in early March in the middle of the Covid crash, and every other prior period where the index saw a similar drop, the S&amp;P 500 was also down every time by an average of 2.3%. Therefore, it's not much of a surprise to see the big drop this week given the big declines in the market. But what about going forward? Do big drops in the NAAIM Index mean a bounce back for markets or further declines?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/091120-NAAIM.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # The Most and Least Heavily Shorted Stocks in the Russell 1,000\n\n&gt; Below is an updated look at the most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000. Each of these 30 stocks has at least 15% of its equity float sold short.\n\n&gt; At the top of the list is Nordstrom (JWN) with 38.66% of its float sold short. With a YTD decline of 61.86%, the shorts have crushed it with JWN this year.\n\n&gt; With its huge portfolio of office and retail real estate, Brookfield Property REIT(BPYU) has the second highest short interest in the Russell 1,000 at 33.7%. BPYU is down 35.7% YTD.\n\n&gt; There are plenty of other well-known companies on the list of the most heavily shorted stocks. Examples include American Airlines (AAL), Virgin Galactic (SPCE), LendingTree (TREE), Wayfair (W), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), ADT, TripAdvisor (TRIP), Beyond Meat (BYND), and Kohl's (KSS).\n\n&gt; One name that is no longer on the list of most shorted stocks is Tesla (TSLA). When we provided an update on short interest back in February (a pre-COVID world), Tesla (TSLA) had more than 17% of its float sold short, but that number is all the way down to 8.3% as of the most recent filing.\n\n&gt; These 30 stocks with the highest short interest are down an average of 3.01% since last Wednesday (9/2) when the S&amp;P 500 made its last closing high. That's actually a little bit better than the 3.55% average decline for the rest of the stocks in the Russell 1,000. And year-to-date, these 30 stocks are up an average of 0.60% versus an average gain of 0.81% for the rest of the index. That's not much of a difference!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/most-heavily-shorted.png))**\n\n&gt; Below is a list of the 30 least shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 as a percentage of equity float. None of these stocks have more than 0.71% of their float sold short, and they're mostly made up of more conservative names in the Health Care and Consumer Staples sectors.\n\n&gt; Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) has the lowest short interest as a percentage of float in the Russell 1,000 at just 0.36%. Microsoft (MSFT) -- one of the key mega-cap Tech names -- has the second lowest short interest, followed by Merck (MRK), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Medtronic (MDT).\n\n&gt; Somewhat surprisingly, Amazon (AMZN) is the sixth least shorted stock in the entire Russell 1,000. While AMZN is still thought of as a high-flying momentum name by many investors, its short interest levels tell a much different story, painting it as more of a non-cyclical stock like Pepsi (PEP), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), or Coca- Cola (KO).\n\n&gt; While the 30 most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 are up 0.60% YTD, the 30 least shorted stocks in the index are up much more at +8%. This group has MSFT, AMZN, HD, and AAPL to thank for that strong performance!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/leastshorted.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Lessons Learned About Rising Rates\n\n&gt; While the direction of the 10-year Treasury yield over the last cycle was decidedly lower, as shown in LPL\u2019s Chart of the Day, there were still six extended periods where it rose at least 0.75%, and in two of those it rose almost 2%. Looking ahead, economic growth below potential, slack in the labor market, and an extremely supportive Federal Reserve (Fed) may limit rate pressure in the near term, but with interest rates already low and massive stimulus in place, we believe the overall direction is likely to be higher.\n\n&gt; \u201cEven in a falling rate period there are lessons from the last cycle about rising rates,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cAmong them: Careful when the Fed stops buying and sometimes the best defense is a good offense.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.9.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; While every economic cycle is unique, the last cycle highlighted these key takeaways about periods of rising rates:\n\n&gt; * **Careful when the Fed stops buying.**  The two drivers of rising rates last cycle were economic growth and Fed bond purchases, also known as quantitative easing (QE). The Fed buys bonds to keep rates down, but the start of Fed buying has actually been the time when rates rise\u2014likely on expectations that the purchases would help strengthen the economy. These periods also often followed large rate declines either because markets anticipated the start of Fed buying or the economy was faltering. The takeaway: unless the economy is really taking off, any rising-rate period may pause for an extended period, or even reverse, when the Fed backs off bond purchases.\n&gt; * **Sometime the best defense is a good offense.** Lower-quality, more economically sensitive bond sectors actually performed well during periods of rising rates during the last cycle. Rate gains were largely driven by economic improvement rather than a large pick-up in inflation, and that\u2019s typically a good environment for sectors like high-yield bonds and bank loans. The downside is that these are much riskier bond sectors and don\u2019t provide the potential diversification benefits of higher-quality bonds during periods of stock declines.\n&gt; * **Don\u2019t expect TIPS to provide much resilience because of their inflation adjustment.** Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are high-quality bonds that have provided a little extra insulation against rising rates compared to similarly dated Treasuries when inflation expectations increased. TIPS prices are adjusted for inflation, but even with the adjustment, they are still very sensitive to rates.\n&gt; * **Investment-grade corporates can both hurt and help.** If credit spreads narrow when rates are rising, investment-grade corporates can post some solid gains in a rising-rate environment, but if spreads are holding steady or even widening, they can be very sensitive to changes in Treasury yields, potentially (although not often) even more sensitive than Treasuries.\n&gt; * **Mortgage-backed securities (MBS)** have not provided as much insulation as corporates, but they also have had less downside. While MBS have certainly outperformed Treasuries during periods of rising rates, they have not performed as well as investment-grade corporates. But they also have come with less downside, losing only 1.4% in their worst performing period compared to a 4% loss during the worst period for corporates.\nWith the Fed still providing strong stimulus and economic growth potentially poised to accelerate, we currently see an increased risk of rates moving higher. We are playing some offense with our equity exposure, which allows us to emphasize a focus on higher-quality bonds. Among bond sectors, we are emphasizing MBS and still prefer investment-grade corporates over Treasuries. History may not repeat, but if it rhymes, this positioning may help add resilience to a fixed income portfolio if rates extend their move off recent lows.\n\n&gt; With the Fed still providing strong stimulus and economic growth potentially poised to accelerate, we currently see an increased risk of rates moving higher.

Below we take a look at the best and worst performing stocks in the Russell 1,000 since the 9/2 high for the S&amp;P. For each stock, we also include its YTD total return and its percentage change from the 3/23 COVID Crash low through 9/2.\n\n&gt; Capri Holdings (CPRI) is up more than any other stock in the Russell 1,000 since 9/2 with a gain of 17.43%. Even after the recent gains, however, Capri -- the holding company for brands like Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo, and Versace -- is still down 52.9% year-to-date.\n\n&gt; Only four other stocks are up more than 10% since 9/2 -- Beyond Meat (BYND), PVH, Virtu Financial (VIRT), and Reinsurance Group (RGA). Interestingly, BYND and VIRT are also up big (~80%) year-to-date, while PVH and RGA are both down more than 35% year-to-date.\n\n&gt; What stands out the most about the list of winners is that only one Technology stock made the cut -- Sabre (SABR). Most names come from the two consumer sectors including cruise-liners like Carnival (CCL), Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise (NCLH), Kohl's (KSS), Williams-Sonoma (WSM), Six Flags (SIX), Foot Locker (FL), and Ralph Lauren (RL). Both UBER and LYFT also made the cut with gains of 6% since 9/2. The 30 biggest winners since 9/2 are still down an average of 20% year-to-date, while the rest of the stocks in the Russell 1,000 are up an average of 1.46% YTD.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/bestsince92.png))**\n\n&gt; While only one Technology stock made the list of biggest winners since 9/2, the sector accounts for two-thirds of the 30 biggest losers over the same time frame. As shown below, since 9/2, the six worst performing stocks in the Russell 1,000 and ten of the worst twelve all come from Tech. Notably, though, these 30 stocks that have all fallen more than 12% since 9/2 are still up an average of 5.6% YTD. Were it not for the horrid YTD performance of the Energy stocks that made the list, the average YTD gain would be even higher.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/worstsince92.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Typical Early September Weakness Recovers Mid-Month Sells Off Month-End\n\n&gt; As of yesterday\u2019s close the market was down more than the historical average performance in September. DJIA was down nearly -3.3%, S&amp;P 500 was down -4.8%, NASDAQ was off 7.9%, Russell 1000 was down -5.2% and Russell 2000 lost 3.7%. Today\u2019s rally looks like the beginning of a textbook mid-month recovery rally However, the second half of September has historically been weaker than the first half. The week after options expiration week can be treacherous with S&amp;P 500 logging 23 weekly losses in 30 years since 1990. End-of-quarter portfolio restructuring, and window dressing can amplify the impacts of any negative headlines.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/75a927aee973e2c31a0d76ff0be15d59/fa78a7e1d90fbdef-fe/s500x750/8f217c04559740d2db6c24b7ea855ecd579ec195.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/Mp84zhth/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/3JGV5KjX/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 9.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 9.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1LCuH7Z.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  9.15.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/IU3xGVJ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 9.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EOC9Qwy.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 9.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/faX2lNR.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 9.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 9.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/CdwssKa.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 9.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 9.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 9.18.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # FedEx Corp. $232.79\n**FedEx Corp.

        "selftext": "Hi there, NKLA bagholders. You're probably enjoying a nice Fanta in your garage, basement, or shed while your wife's massage therapist helps her relax before her boyfriend comes home. Good choice of beverage. I know you've been happily stacking tendies all summer from your smooth-brain, stonks-only-go-up TSLA/AAPL calls. I know you expected it to be easy over here on the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b side of things, especially after Hindenburg Meme Labs released such high-Scoville meme fodder on such an obviously overvalued target.\n\nBut sadly, over here you actually have to know what the fuck you're doing if you want to avoid getting regauged to a new bore diameter by J-Pow's low orbit money cannon. You have to know when a stonk is going to tank, and to know when, you have to know why.\n\nAnd no, \"being an obvious scam\" is not a valid reason why. What did you think moved prices? Fundamental value? Free cash flow? No. If you want to play in a market that makes sense, go back to managing your wife's yoga instructor's fantasy football team.\n\nPeople move markets. Not people like you, no matter what Bloomberg says, it's people with allocation authority over huge pools of capital. People like the ones who participated in NKLA's $525 million early access special boys only PIPE the day before their IPO on 6/3. They bought at $10. They hold at least 14% of NKLA's traded shares, and they can't sell until 12/21. And a totally legal little caveat they agreed to says the price has to remain above $12 for the last 20 days of their lockup for those shares to become tradeable.\n\nThat's right. NKLA bribed a bunch of big money funds with extra-cheap shares to make sure they've got skin in the game, and they'll keep propping up NKLA until their lockup expires. When you're a fraudulent company with no reason to be taken seriously, it's a nice way of buying alignment. If you've ever murdered somebody to cement your membership in a gang, it's like that: now you have to be on the same side no matter what, because the alternative is life in prison. Go fuck yourself, John Nash.\n\nWhat does this mean for you, the Fanta-sipping retail bagholder? It means the stupidly overpriced short-term puts you bought after the Hindenburg news dropped never had a chance of printing. The shops writing those puts always knew they'd expire worthless, because they're professionals who already knew this shit, not degenerate gambling addicts warming themselves over a burning pile of losing lottery tickets.\n\nBut don't lose hope, because the flip side of this bleak reality is that there's always somebody dumber than you. Probably. You just need to bite the bullet and get out of your dumb reactionary short play ASAP, even though it's down 60% from its manic high, sell it to some poor autist who didn't read this post and chill for a month or two.\n\nYes, a month or two. Unless the SEC actually extracts the glue from its nose and enforces the law (it won't), NKLA isn't moving until PIPE investors say it does. So there's no reason to build a position now only to eat 50% theta decay while the big boys prop the price up against the minor selling pressure of dumb IPO buyers who started seeing your HTML5 memes popping up on CNBC. Instead, wait for premiums to come down as the target expiry gets closer. Don't cut it too close - funds that didn't get in on the PIPE will be anticipating this selloff, and the price will start dropping in advance of the PIPE lockup expiry date no matter what kind of defense the big shareholders can put up. If you start buying puts on 12/14 it's too late. So start building on 10/14 or 11/1.\n\nBy the way, the only other big NKLA move coming down the pipe besides Trevor's big move outside the reach of extradition is the end of the lockup period for one of the original investors, Worthington Industries, which can sell a stake equivalent to 2% of NKLA's traded shares 90 days after IPO, or 10/1. But compared to the money waiting for 12/21, not to mention the squeeze you autists are putting on NKLA shares by wildly overbidding for short positions, this selling pressure probably won't amount to much. The real play is in December.\n\nPosition: Nothing until 11/1. Then NKLA 25p, 20p, 15p, 10p 1/15",
