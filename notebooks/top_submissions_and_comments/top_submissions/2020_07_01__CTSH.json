        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # WSB Learns Ch 3: The Cloud Environment (Draft)\n\n# # About Me\n\nI'm a Mexican American software engineer in the fintech industry (US) and avocado farmer (Mexico).  I have 8 years working in a manufacturing, fintech, and education policy. My economic research and model largely revolves around increasing Mexican-American trade after USMCA changes and I write around organizations that will be affected by Mexican development and American innovation. I write extensively because I love to teach online, debate, and learn a few things myself in the process.\n\n* Digital Transactions\n* Cybersecurity\n* Cross-border Trade\n* Agricultural Technology\n* Manufacturing support\n* Labor laws &amp; IP/data protection\n\nSome of these picks are abundantly clear. For example:\n\n1. Nucor Steel will see operations grow\n2. Kansas City Southern Rail is a critical supply chain element\n3. Paypal and Square will continue to build financial services in underbanked nations like Mexico.\n4. Cloudflare will offer unbelievably inexpensive cybersecurity and networking support\n5. Texas Instruments will build advanced manufacturing technology based on computer vision\n6. **Dropbox will continue to expand tooling in academia, camera and signature solutions, and data storage in an era of advanced data collection &amp; computing.**\n7. Institutions and financieers are investing in logistics and data center real estate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# DBX 24-26c 8/21\n\n# DBX 24c 9/18\n\n[https://assets-global.website-files.com/580ea75512564ed05c3a8455/5bfc62c5aca97fa17998085e\\_dropbox-blog-image-1434x590.jpg](https://assets-global.website-files.com/580ea75512564ed05c3a8455/5bfc62c5aca97fa17998085e_dropbox-blog-image-1434x590.jpg)\n\n# # My Belief\n\n**Dropbox is in the right place at the right time, much like a recycled cardboard boxing company is in logistics.** Cloud computing is complex and Big Tech will antitrust and decoupling pressures as time goes on. These companies are not stupid and are able to survive the change by decentralizing and consolidating over time. Telecom, oil, and other industries have done this in the past. However, this is probably the weakest factor in Dropbox's position.\n\nThe simple truth is that the marketshare of files and file processing is fucking huge and it's possible to grow at a respectable rate despite the fact that iCloud, Google Drive, and AWS S3 exists.  There are banking, manufacturing, and other data processors that require this shit and it's the same reason you're seeing organizations like ZScaler grow.\n\n* Adobe has a strong grasp on video, animated, and drawn files\n* Dropbox blessed legions of academics with window-mac file problems\n* Microsoft has made an enormous change by acquiring software engineering files via Github and NPM, which leverages them further into software automation with Softomotive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*We focus particularly on the use cases that are complementary. And we see ourselves as playing an important role in terms of taking a couple steps back and making sure the overall experience is coherent. More than we're trying to engage in a dogfight with any particular tool or facet of the experience.* \\- Dropbox CEO\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oodnkwv4q5c51.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd6c45b7abd0d7db7b89d6540896cb40e218abd0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6aqbxas5q5c51.jpg?width=2716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da9655de09d81bba1c11d14a6b71a7b94b05c591\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pinsndv6q5c51.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1d162b2f7b72a356b86a8ed6be5365c21a0de83\n\nI actually view Dropbox closer to Adobe and DocuSign, but much more of a longterm cloud infrastructure layer rather than a sexy app that enhances the experience of using devices like iPad Pros and such.\n\nYou can do a lot of cool shit with files and I'm sure that the leadership behind DropBox is highly cognizant of the possibilities behind legal software, contract security, signature software, transactions, and other critical supply chain elements like academic management, IT support, and a financially robust competitor that institutions are happy to purchase stake in. This is file tooling and it's a big fucking industry that will be empowered by AI, computer vision, data processing, and the real estate of large data centers.\n\nIm making this over simplified, but the IT world is structured in layers. This extends from your router to your internet provider's telecommunication. You can imagine that organizations like Cloudflare &amp; Dropbox exist in separate layers under the same idea.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p8np7stlg5c51.png?width=3518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc38df1402a4220c8beccdeb3d467bf27847b3e9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8tso1caia5c51.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98513757632de2d7900842a2ace2951be58c7360\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2401iz3oa5c51.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a697cbc38f89c84c7150c7fc8102778a6f3bb14\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p47zwp8os5c51.png?width=1047&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=486885d26d0b1122738df569e2accae89bc5ce22\n\n# # Why Dropbox?\n\nIn short, DropBox is wildly popular among\n\n\\- Academics\n\n\\- Accountants\n\n\\- HR teams\n\n\\- Deep Technology relationships over the past decade (early Spotify, startups, app integrations)\n\n\\- Anyone that has to deal with a fuck ton of files all of the time.\n\nDropbox is very similar to Cloudflare. It has taken years of careful development, relationship building, and investor confidence before going public on a highly distributed, robust, and cost effective technology for both Enterprise and SMB level users. They are technologists that know how to build a business.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ik5t8m7h65c51.png?width=1247&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4e2d7fa558823f75e4cf80dfaa295eebdbe83ba\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Dropbox Marketshare in Mexico](https://preview.redd.it/riv24qhq65c51.png?width=2989&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2df4b27406cbf8863e1eeabd1a2676d7c510740d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[2019 - Dropbox acquires HelloSign &amp; HelloWorks to manage legal contracts, signatures, and business needs.](https://preview.redd.it/2a05uwk385c51.png?width=729&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41db97e6bad427fe7d6428ea36e6a7ff81798095)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[DropBox is known for being financially consistent. ](https://preview.redd.it/v7hreqc985c51.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8dbd9e369864b58c618640dc83f2b7b817c81f54)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# ",

        "selftext": "Welcome to another Unusual Options Activity post. Why do DD when you can see what stocks people are heavily investing in? I post these daily.\n\n**Context -**\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 increased by 0.5% today. There was positive news recording a vaccine and Pfizer. PFE notably had the highest number of contracts traded for the day. The ADP Employment Change Report for June again showed gains for private-sector payrolls. The ISM Manufacturing Index for June beat consensus with 52.6% (consensus was 49.2%). The communication services, utilities, and real estate sector led the market higher, increasing +1.8%, +1.9%, +1.9%, respectively.\n\n*Today\u2019s Option Activity Fast Facts -*\n\n***Sentiment \u2013 CBOE Put/Call Ratio -*** 0.90, VIX: (28.96, -1.47, -4.8%). \n\n***Highest Multiple Over Daily Average -*** DXC with 46 x the ADV of 4173. There were 96199 calls and 94803 puts.\n\n***Ticker with Most Contracts -*** PFE with 329836 contracts traded today with an AVD of 95042. There were 277805 calls and 52031 puts.\n\n***Largest Put / Call Ratio -*** MUR with a 102.87 P/C ratio. There were 30142 puts and 293 calls.\n\n***Largest Call / Put Ratio -*** SKX with a 97.16 C/P ratio. There were 34978 calls and 360 puts. \n\n*\\*Stocks must be &gt;$6, Highest Multiple must have &gt;1k ADV, Largest ratios must have an option volume &gt;10k*\n\n*MOMENTUM UNUSUAL OPTION ACTIVITY -*\n\n***First Momentum Stock Pick -***\n\n**Ticker :**  AA 10.95  -0.29 ,( -2.58 %)  **Earnings :** 2020-07-15\n\n**Name :** Alcoa Corp.  **Sector :** Non-Energy Minerals\n\n**Special Considerations :**   **Industry :** Aluminum\n\n**Option Information -**\n\n *Today\u2019s Option Volume:* 41029  *OptionOI:* 208019\n\n *ADV:* 10621  ***Multiple of ADV:*** **4**\n\n *Total Calls:* 37921  *Total Puts:* 3108\n\n ***Calls at Ask:*** **43.0 %**  *Calls at Bid:* 32.3 %  ***C/P Ratio:*** **12.2**\n\n *Puts at Ask:* 28.1 %  *Puts at Bid:* 21.4 %   *P/C Ratio:* 0.1 \n\n**Notable Strikes :**\n\n**JUL 10 \u201920 12C** had 29.9k VLM with a 2.12k OI. \n\n**DarkPool Prints :**\n\nNone \n\n**News : 24-Jun-20 6:10 pm:** **USTR conducting review that could lead to $3.1 bln in additional tariffs on EU imports**\n\n**My Impression :**\n\nYesterday featured MT which is a steel company. The hypothesis was the call volume at the time may have been related to some sort of new tariffs being enacted. It appears there was confirmation of this yesterday after I posted.  I\u2019ll likely be picking up some shares of this tomorrow. \n\n***Featured Trade: SHLL***\n\nI don\u2019t make featured trade posts often, because these opportunities do not come around all that frequently.\n\nSHLL added options today. There has been significant number of comparisons between NKLA and SHLL. The premiums are very high, especially for the puts. SHLL is a SPAC - or a Special Acquisition Company. These stocks typically have a floor of $10.\n\n\"A typical SPAC will offer stock at $10 per share and give the management team two years to find a suitable target. If the SPAC doesn\u2019t find a good merger candidate, then its terms call for it to liquidate. Unless the SPAC finds a candidate, the money raised in the IPO is held in trust, and so IPO investors typically get most or all of their $10 initial investment back.\" - Sorry can't provide links, but it was a motley fool article. You can search for it if you are interested. \n\nThe Hyliion and SHLL merger is slated to go through sometime in Q3, September or October. **The premium for the OCT 16 '20 25Ps is high. I sold 10 of them for 11.70.** I was the only volume at this strike price at the time. A few others have decided to follow the trade, but the volume is still low. This makes my break-even price for SHLL 13.30. \n\nHypothetically, if the merger does not go through the floor for the stock should be right around $10. It can go lower, but it is less likely.\u00a0**You are essentially risking about 3.30 for a maximum upside profit of 11.70.**\u00a0Not a bad return. Other risks include SHLL being sub $10 after the merger. \n\nThis is the first day that SHLL has had options. The option chain was not available on all brokers, however, it was present on IB. The option OI and VLM reflects that it is not available on all brokers. You should exercise caution because as of right now the low volume is causing wide spreads, which likely helped my fill. Right now, the largest call that can be bought is the 30C. I would expect the option chain to be extended tomorrow or in the next few days. People are likely to buy a lot of OTM calls and force the MMs to start delta hedging the sold call so there is a potential catalyst for this stock to move significantly higher in the nearer term.\n\n**There is no such thing as a risk free trade, but there are good bets. I think this is a good bet with limited downside risk.**\n\nDISCLAIMER \u2013 These are my observations that I have made at the end of each day and trades that I am considering placing or watching. I am not responsible for your financial losses if you follow any of these trades. As always, do your due diligence.",
