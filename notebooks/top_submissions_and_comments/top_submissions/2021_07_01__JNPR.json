        "selftext": "Now that warrant prices have rebounded 30+% from their bottom, there seems to be sentiment from various folks that warrant prices are too high right now. However, I haven't seen concrete data/evidence on this yet. Generally speaking of course, I encourage you to do your own due diligence and use actual data to come to your own conclusion instead of being purely swayed by influential commenters/upvotes. In this spirit, I decided to create this table.\n\nAs an example of how to use this table, if you think that in the worst-case, the target this team chooses will cause the commons to go to $X after merger, base your warrant purchase decision on that.\n\nCommons between $9.80 and $10.20 have an average warrant price of $2.40, and a range of $1.4-$3.2.\n\nCommons between $8.80 and $9.20 have an average warrant price of $1.91, and a range of $0.65-$2.6. ($0.65 is from BROG, not sure what's going on there--2 for 1 maybe? Without BROG, the average price becomes $2.23 and a range of $1.9-2.6)\n\nCommons between $7.85 and $8.20 have an average warrant price of $1.56 and a range of $1.36-1.72.\n\n*Note*: *Some of these are 2 for 1 warrants, which means you need 2 warrants to redeem for 1 share and therefore would be half the value of a normal 1 for 1 warrant. NVVE is an example of this, but I haven't bothered look up any of the other warrant structures. Some of the warrant cells are blank because some warrants have already been called or the SPAC didn't have warrants to begin with.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Post-SPAC Ticker Symbol|Post-SPAC Company Name|Commons|Symbol-W|Warrants|SPAC Name|Merger Completion Date|SPAC IPO Size|Initial Target Industry|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|EVGO|EVgo Inc.|15.1|EVGOW|4.40|Climate Change Crisis Real Impact I Acquisition Corp (CLII)|7/1/2021|$230.00|Carbon avoidance and removal, Sustainability|\n|AVPT|AvePoint, Inc.|11.95|AVPTW|3.35|Apex Technology Acquisition Corp (APXT)|7/1/2021|$350.00|Tech, Software, Internet|\n|SHCR|Sharecare, Inc.|9.33|SHCRW|1.75|Falcon Capital Acquisition Corp.

In this spirit, I decided to create this table. \n\nAs an example of how to use this table, if you think that in the worst-case, the target this team chooses will cause the commons to go to $X after merger, base your warrant purchase decision on that. \n\nCommons that are between $9.80 and $10.20 have an average warrant price of $2.40, and a range of $1.4-$3.2.\n\nCommons that are between $8.80 and $9.20 have an average warrant price of $1.91, and a range of $0.65-$2.6. ($0.65 is from BROG, not sure what's going on there--2 for 1 maybe? Without BROG, the average price becomes $2.23 and a range of $1.9-2.6)\n\nCommons between $7.85 and $8.20 have an average warrant price of $1.56 and a range of $1.36-1.72.\n\n*Note*: *Some of these are likely 2 for 1 warrants, which means you need 2 warrants to redeem for 1 share. NVVE is an example of this, but I haven't bothered look up any of the other warrant structures. Some of the commons don't have corresponding warrants and some warrants have already been called, which is why many cells are blank.* \n\n\u200b \n\n|Post-SPAC Ticker Symbol|Post-SPAC Company Name|Commons|Symbol-W|Warrants|SPAC Name|Merger Completion Date|SPAC IPO Size|Initial Target Industry|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|EVGO|EVgo Inc.|15.1|EVGOW|4.40|Climate Change Crisis Real Impact I Acquisition Corp (CLII)|7/1/2021|$230.00|Carbon avoidance and removal, Sustainability|\n|AVPT|AvePoint, Inc.|11.95|AVPTW|3.35|Apex Technology Acquisition Corp (APXT)|7/1/2021|$350.00|Tech, Software, Internet|\n|SHCR|Sharecare, Inc.|9.33|SHCRW|1.75|Falcon Capital Acquisition Corp.

        "selftext": "tl;dr: Katapult Holdings (KPLT) is one of the best values in the market today. It has a dirt cheap valuation vs. its peers, and the growth runway is massive. Long shares.\n\nKatapult Holdings (KPLT) recently went public through a reverse merger. Katapult is a leading \"buy now, pay later\" (BNPL) player that provides financing options for non-prime customers. The newly merged company had its first quarterly earnings two weeks ago, and execution was solid. KPLT is profitable, growing quickly, and trading at a huge discount to other players in this field. I believe Katapult is a minimum $25 stock trading for $11.30. Keep reading if you want to know why.\n\nWhat Is Katapult?\n\nKatapult\u00a0provides BNPL options for non-prime Ecommerce customers. Katapult is the only pure-play financing platform dedicated to Ecommerce, as shown below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rjuc35coft871.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d22f897955d25ad8dd93d1f1a66fa226c08cba32\n\nSource: Initial Investor Presentation\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 38% of US consumers are considered nonprime, making it difficult for these consumers to access financing options. Additionally, 67% of consumers with a FICO score below 700 need a BNPL option for large purchases. Katapult provides this solution for online customers. Katapult's platform integrates seamlessly to merchant sites, so customers can choose the financing option as they check out.\u00a0\n\nConsumers are given three payment options through Katapult:\n\n* **First 90 Days**  \n\n   * Customers only pay the cash price + a 5% fee.\n* **After 90 Days**  \n\n   * Customers can complete the purchase at a significant discount to the full lease-to-own cost.\n* **Full Lease Term**  \n\n   * Payment is \\~2x the lease origination amount over the life of the lease.\n\nKatapult is partnered with merchants such as Wayfair, Lenovo, Purple, and Motorola. The company also has partner integrations with Ecommerce platforms like Shopify, BigCommerce, and OpenCart. Katapult gives online platforms access to larger customer bases and higher repeat purchase rates (45%).\u00a0\n\nKatapult also uses a \"waterfall\" method to gain customers that failed prime lending applications. When consumers fail to get financing from prime lenders like Affirm, they are passed on to Katapult.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jpcbpo9pft871.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8b4791b3ff9896f31abd9590288794f9c2d320f\n\n*Source: Investor Presentation*\n\nAs you can see from the graph above, Katapult approves \\~60% of consumers who failed prime lender applications. These \"waterfall\" applicants generate $117M incremental originations per 1M applications.\n\nKatapult's risk model reviews over 100 attributes, including lease history, prior payment behavior, and behavioral biometrics, to approve or deny applicants in under five seconds. The company has a sub-3% fraud rate across its portfolio, and it recovers 80- 90% of lease costs of charge offs.\n\nKatapult has also gotten more efficient as its platform has grown.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/unnh0l7qft871.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fac474589c2380cb0938e7b0d46ad8e78a8a1103\n\n*Source: Investor Presentation*\n\nIndexed return on leases have increased each year as Katapult's customer base has expanded.\n\nQ1 Performance\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Katapult went public through a reverse merger. Reverse mergers are notorious for providing and falling short of aggressive revenue projections. Here are Katapult's projections from December.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5m7ntn9rft871.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=903d916097cfb87bb9fe6a28bdf4d3410d322aa6\n\n*Source: Investor Presentation*\n\nNow let's see how the company performed. Katapult released Q1 earnings yesterday. The company did $82M in revenue, up 88% year over year. Net income was $8.1M, or a 120% increase from Q1 last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $14.7M, good for a 122% increase over last year too.\n\nHow about forward guidance?\u00a0\n\n* Gross Originations: $375-$425 million\n* Revenue: $425-$475 million\n* Adjusted EBITDA: $50-$60 million\n\nWhile the EBITDA target dropped slightly, revenue and originations are in line with December's projections.\n\nRelationship with Wayfair\n\nOne metric that stood out to me was the acceleration of originations from non-Wayfair merchants. 58% of Katapult's revenue came from Wayfair in 2020. However, in Q1 2021, Non-Wayfair originations were up 87.4%. This is compared to a 66% increase in Q4 2020 and 46.1% for FY 2020. Meanwhile, Wayfair originations were up 57.7%. Recent execution suggests that Katapult is making great strides to diversify its revenue streams.\n\nWhile Wayfair is still the company's largest source of income, Katapult CEO Orlando Zayas is not concerned. In a recent interview, he said this about their parternship with Wayfair:\n\n\"*I\u2019m not worried about it because if you\u2019re going to have a partner to have high concentration right now, Wayfair is a great partner to have. So we\u2019re really thrilled with their relationship. And the relationship is pretty deep too. We\u2019re actually in the process of doing a direct integration with them so that, you know, the tentacles, if you will, within the company are a lot tighter, and then we have a two year agreement with them. \\[\u2026.\\] So, you know, am I worried about it? No, because it\u2019s a great retailer. And I think our relationship is very strong, but, you know, I would like to minimize it and have, you know, five or six Wayfairs and a bunch of other smaller ones.*\"\n\nWith Katapult hinting at a deeper partnership with the furniture retailer, and the company showing accelerated growth in its non-Wayfair base, I am not too concerned with the heavy revenue concentration.\n\nValuation Gap\n\nValuation is the driving factor in my Katapult bull thesis. The stock is dirt cheap. While several reverse mergers have priced deals at sky-high valuations, KPLT went public at a $1B valuation with $450M in 2021 revenue.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s8wz8gbtft871.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db269053f7e8e661f0efe2bb871059e8feca8158\n\n*Source: Investor Presentation*\n\nThe graphic above comes from the December investor presentation. 14x EBITDA for a company growing sales, net income, and EBITDA at \\~100% for the last three years is great value by itself. When you compare this to other companies in the sector, Katapult looks criminally undervalued.\u00a0\n\nLet's look at the valuation gap now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kft0oa7uft871.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14b451c5c8afc295d37c65b25e5328b7cf53f536\n\nAt Tuesday's $11.37 price, Katapult was trading at 2.7x sales and 22.3x EBITDA. That's less than 1/3 of PayPal's (PYPL) revenue multiple and 1/2 of Paypal's EBITDA multiple, despite growing revenue 3x faster. When compared to Affirm (AFRM), a more direct competitor, the valuation gap is even larger. Push that valuation out to 2022, and KPLT is 8x EBITDA and 1.5x revenue. That's a value-stock price for a hypergrowth company.\n\n22.4x revenue for an unprofitable company growing at 40%, vs. 2.7x revenue for a profitable company growing at 65%. If Katapult went public through a traditional IPO, it would be worth over $2B right now. Because it used a reverse merger, sentiment around the stock has been poor.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nA study from Juniper Research suggests that BNPL transactions will grow from $226B in 2021 to $995B by 2026. 55% of Americans used a BNPL option as of March 2021, vs. just 37% in July 2020. There will be room for a lot of winners in this market, and Katapult will be one of them.\n\nKatapult is forecasting over $1B in revenue by 2023, and the company could beat this number if it keeps aggressively expanding to include new merchants. Katapult added 26 new retail partners in Q1 alone. Additionally, Katapult will benefit from the growth of its current partners like Wayfair.\n\nHere's the deal: there has been no sell-side coverage on this stock yet. When IBs start initiating coverage, it's going to moon. \"Price target $35 based on XYZ estimates\". You want to front run those releases. This a millionaire-making stock. When valuation is expensive, execution has to be perfect. When valuation is cheap? Any good news is a catalyst. I am giving you a $30 stock for $11. Don't miss it.\n\nRisks\n\nLike any investment, Katapult has its fair share of risks. The primary risk factors are:\n\n* Customer concentration\n* Credit risk from nonprime consumers\n* Competitors entering the nonprime market\n\nWhile Wayfair is still the company's largest customer, Katapult has been growing its non-Wayfair revenue base at an accelerating rate. Management assured investors that Wayfair would be a partner for a long time, so I don't foresee this risk causing any issues with business in the short term. Katapult has also been able to post consistent profits while dealing with nonprime customers, and its risk model has proven to be more accurate as the customer base expands. Finally, I don't see Affirm or another competitor taking market share from Katapult. KPLT has a multi-year head start in this market niche, and it has been able to scale its operations profitably. While other companies could enter this sector in the future, the total addressable market is large enough to accommodate multiple players.\u00a0\n\nConclusion\n\nStop chasing stocks that already peaked, and get in early for once. Katapult is a criminally undervalued stock given its growth rate and competitors' valuations, and I think it should be trading around $25 per share at the minimum. As we move further away from the reverse merger, Katapult will trade on its own merit, and I think the stock will appreciate accordingly. Assuming Katapult continues to scale its revenue and expand its customer base, I think the stock has a massive growth runway. I'm long shares, and I plan to hold them for a while.",

Long shares.\n\nPositions: [https://imgur.com/a/2XNBlIR](https://imgur.com/a/2XNBlIR)\n\nKatapult Holdings (KPLT) recently went public through a reverse merger. Katapult is a leading \"buy now, pay later\" (BNPL) player that provides financing options for non-prime customers. The newly merged company had its first quarterly earnings two weeks ago, and execution was solid. KPLT is profitable, growing quickly, and trading at a huge discount to other players in this field.
