        "selftext": "Listen up boys, the moment I heard SOFI was going public was the moment I dropped a lot of money into it, used the app for a long time and they're going to be dominating the FinTech sector. First off here's YOLO Proof: https://imgur.com/a/rIYNnnp - the total gains reflected is not accurate as I rolled a lot of my July contracts to October for similar pricing.\nOnto the DD:\n- GALILEO, the B2B Monster - This company you probably never heard of got acquired by Sofi last year. They are a payment processing platform that financial tech companies use to process payments, issue company branded debit cards. A similar company Marqeta $MQ which powers $SQ debit cards is valued at 15 Billion ALONE. Galileo is only one subdivision of the SOFI conglomerate, as of this writing $SOFI is valued 16.83 Billion. Over 90% of all digital banks in North America and over 70 of the top 100 Fintech companies use Galileo, it speaks for itself. https://imgur.com/a/slEyUSe\n- The shorts and Goliath - This stock has been shorted with an insane borrow fee of 222.82%. Shortable stocks shows 'Zero Borrow', but still lists 45000 shares available. Fintel shows on 06/24 there are '0' SOFI short shares available. I don't see why this stock is so shorted, but it is a company that went public via Chamath Palihapitiya via IPOE. Just like CLOV and SPCE before this. - forewarning, a lockup period expires for 5% of shareholders today, I believe a lot of people sold in anticipation of insiders selling, but I'm a firm believer in the company nonetheless.\n- SOFI is applying to become a national bank to get their cost of money down, and they have attempted to speed that process up by acquiring a small bank and infusing cash into it:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/SEeFYKm\nThe one stop shop -\nSOFI's goal is to become a one stop shop for consumers. Banking, lending, credit cards, trade stocks, provides insurance, everything. This is the one thing I have yet to see any FinTech attempt. Most FinTech's stick to a singular product but SOFI is seeking to service everyone's financial needs in one app. SOFI's revenue will only continue to grow as if a new member joins they'll likely use more than just the initial service they got on board with.\n- SOFI Invest - I think this is probably the most important platform for them to be working. When Robinhood Robin hooded us back in February, everyone was looking for another platform to go onto. A lot of people went to Fidelity, a lot stayed, and a few went to SOFI, this is SOFI's short fall. They do not have margin yet and no options currently, but Anthony Noto, the CEO of SOFI announced that it's on their road map: https://imgur.com/a/apMyXXD\nI believe they're aware of of the importance of adding options and margin and I'm hoping itll be soon as they're 100% getting my business after they do so. SOFI Hong Kong already has margin as well.\n- SOFI Stadium, come on, what a chad company flexing a stadium even though they're new to the game.   https://imgur.com/undefined\nAt the end I like this company, they have great potential to become a dominating\nDisclaimer: These opinions are of my own, I own $Sofi options.\nTL;DR: A great financial tech company that has a lot of potential, earnings are around the corner August 11, 2021, BULLISH AF",

        "selftext": "TL;DR at bottom\n\nI\u2019m extremely bullish on AMC. In fact, more than I was back in late January and early February. The inflation rate, collateral issues, and reverse repos are all factors that lead me to believe that investors are inching ever so closer to creating heavy losses for hedge funds and short sellers. As you may be aware, during the AMC shareholder count that occurred on June 2nd, CEO Adam Aaron stated retail investors comprise 80% of AMC shares with each individual averaging about 120 shares each. As of 9am EST this Wednesday morning, AMC has seen 1.76 million trades, and despite no new huge news, it\u2019s already seeing a gradual decrease from yesterday\u2019s close. So why are so many people selling? That\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t think we are. Earlier this morning, Jim Cramer commented on AMC\u2019s price action in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1405138423741100033):\n\n\u201cMeme people AMC is down\u2026. I think it\u2019s time to burst in.\u201d Now this is entirely speculation on my part, but I believe that this could be serving as a cover for a short ladder attack, which is something that many GME, AMC, and other tickers are familiar with. That being said, I do expect the rest of today and this trading week to be rather ugly. However, no one said that a ride to the moon would be a smooth one. In the past 5 months alone, retail investors have caused billions of dollars worth of losses to hedge funds and overall people that want to screw over working class people. In fact, this past Monday (the 14th), when AMC surged 15%, it caused over $515 million worth of losses. This is chump change compared to some of the other numbers we\u2019ve seen, but they add up. Another interesting piece of information I learned is that recent reports showed that AMC is the most traded stock on Fidelity and Freetrade, and the 3rd most traded stock on Robinhood. Just take look below.\n\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1agt5p2p0n571.png?width=1495&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2ca6fcbd7807333102d8674635b8851cb175d979\n\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ykdc6hmq0n571.jpg?width=1408&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1d81f7f5ca89f3b3ed5b7b8c4c342a03a068ddbd\n\nI personally dislike the Motely Fool, but it allowed me to view information provided by Robinhood. As you can see, sentiment for AMC remains high across multiple brokerages.\n\n&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ji7s761s0n571.png?width=1940&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3d5937d5adab17070ada855f0ec8beb31a600bf8\n\nAs of June 2nd, AMC has managed to remain above $42.72 and this has continued for two whole weeks! This has resulted in devastating losses for short sellers. It went as far as touching $70 just two weeks ago. And although it is currently in the mid-50\u2019s range, I believe that bullish sentiment from traders will allow it to continue to climb even in the face of short ladder attacks. According to the data on Webull, AMC has seen more large-scale orders recently. This might be due to the amount of options expiring this Friday, the 18th. Down below, I\u2019ve listed the large-scale buy orders placed and executed in the last 5 trading days:\n\n6/09: $1,829,580\n\n6/10: $4,826,810\n\n6/11: $6,961,840\n\n6/14: $5,458,670\n\n6/15: $9,946,860\n\nMind you, this is the net value of all large-scale orders that were placed those days. In other words, it took the difference from all the large-scale buys as well as the large-scale sells. The final numbers for all of those dates came out to a positive number, meaning there were more buys than sells. That doesn\u2019t even take into account people buying from RH, Etrade, Fidelity, etc. Needless to say, buying pressure is immense right now, which may the reason there has been an increase of FUD, shills, and bots trying to direct people away from AMC and into other tickers and ultimately tricking them into losing their money into a pump and dump.\n\nIn terms of good news, AMC is currently poised to become the dominant movie theatre chain in L.A., which would include two shopping mall locations. With both tourists and locals visiting during the summer, and with more and more Americans receiving the vaccine and the desire to return to normal coming along with it, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise to see significant increases in revenue as time goes on. This change might not be an immediate one, of course, but it does force investors to consider the long-term plays that come with it.\n\nShort sellers can\u2019t hold forever, but investors can. Short interest will slowly eat away at them and one day, as we all know, they\u2019ll be forced to cover. When this happens, it\u2019ll be every man for himself. Seeing as to how many of us control the stock, though, we could, in theory, just not sell, which would cause an unprecedented rise in stock price. It should be common sense by now that we know that this cannot be accomplished by a single individual, hence the phrase: \u201cApes together strong.\u201d \ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\udcaa\n\nTL;DR I feel as though bitch boy Cramer and his ass-kissing gay bear friends are working extra hard to get people to paper-hand. He wants our bananas, but I refuse to give it to him. I think there are plenty of catalysts that not only make the current price sustainable, but on the verge of further increasing. As always, I\u2019m not a financial advisor. Do your own research before making any investment decisions. I just like the stock. AMC to the moon, my friends \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15",

Which is why I knew I had to find a way to buy in.\n\nI then turned to the only place I knew that could help me find out more about how to invest in the next Benjamin Hornigold:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u4xewo0kcc371.png?width=296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fad1d5fbaa6ca2099a6d50937bfbc01ba806dcb7\n\nIt didn't work. However, after a few more days of digging around googling autistic keywords, I found it:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j1s27bfgcc371.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce27a12461fd6e8263a54401e0a629de4988afec\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Found my Hornigold](https://preview.redd.it/aopgdopecc371.png?width=372&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f70c98f6e552c9a81de03ae10b5485669988aa1b)\n\n**Bingo.**\n\nDisclaimer before I go any further: You might be thinking to yourself, \"wow what a prick. Who would invest and give guns to people who you pretty much know are going to use them on other humans? What kind of sick person would do such a thing?\"\n\nTo that I say 1) fuck off and 2) this is **GOOD FOR THE ENVIROMENT:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nc8s2jg6dc371.png?width=548&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80b4da050cd95ecfd3e0459f093066921744dd77\n\nSo - with the ethics/DD taken care of, I began my Journey to find a way to get some pirates invested in.\n\n# Part 2: Actually finding the pirate stonk exchange\n\nNot gonna lie - this was a pain in the ass. Turns out, the only way to actually invest in pirates is to give them the money/guns physically. My Wendy's check didn't give me enough for an air plane ticket and to invest so instead I decided to just buy the RPGs and send em out to them.\n\nI got in contact with a guy who called himself '3 leg' off a site im pretty sure I cant post on here and sent him an email asking if they had any stock I could buy in their pirate crew (and how many shares I would get for sending over an RPG).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[I made sure to translate it into somali too.](https://preview.redd.it/avrh9es0dc371.png?width=1315&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1fb8cd5800eb0d5c1e74bee8e67ee67b63504d0)\n\n After some time he got back to me:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5sv6nkg3dc371.png?width=243&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5e5529d89f8215bfed1b2f8e04dbce431f50acc\n\nSo, I bought 3 RPG-7's from places unknown and sent them off to Jowlo Road.\n\nIt has currently been about 5 months now since I sent the original 3 RPG's. The only contact I have received from 3 leg was some weird email in Somali:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i0g092xscc371.png?width=289&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1880a30b80699440fa858277425616c9229bfad5\n\n# Part 3: Current Day\n\nSo here we are, almost 6 months down the line - no money left in my bank account and no word from 3 leg. I'm starting to think something might have happened to them while they were out at sea and am worried. 3 leg, from what I knew, was a pretty stand up guy. He replied fast to my emails and was quick to send me an address. It makes me think the RPG's might not have been enough. I am saving up currently to make a trip out to Hardaheere (the town he lives in) to make sure they are okay and to hopefully find the tendieman too. Will report back if I make any headway.\n\nPositions: 1 share GME, 1 FIS JAN 2022 210c, 3 RPG-7 military grade unmarked, 46 RPG-7 ammunition\n\nObligatory Rockets: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \n\nP.S when is paper trading competition? out of $$$",

        "selftext": "AMD's latest financial reports blew all estimates out of the water... and their latest guidance for 50% growth (up from 37%) is conservative. Here is why:\n\nFUNDAMENTALS: IT'S ALL ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT\n\nIn a post COVID-19 world, people will continue to flock towards entertainment.\n\nAs  confirmed by both TESLA and AMD recently, the latest Model X and S will  bring AMD silicon (GPU &amp; APU). This is HUGE, because this feature  will eventually trickle down as an optional to the Model 3 and rest of  the Tesla fleet. Why is this important? Just listen to Elon Musk drool  over PS5 performance on road trips with autonomous driving. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl\\_-bFNRJaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_-bFNRJaw)\n\nBut that IS NOT ALL, as Valve will be launching a new portable handheld. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFn6LzUFTTA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFn6LzUFTTA)\n\nIn essence PS4, PS5, XBOX X &amp; S and Valve are all going FULL AMD.\n\nWho do you think Ford, GM, Chrysler, Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Volkswagen, Renault/Nissan will go with?\n\nENTERTAINMENT IS KEY and AMD is all over it.\n\nThis  is also HUGE as entertainment software will be tailored to AMD's  processing pipeline. Unreal Engine 5 is the perfect example, which  ALREADY performs better on a 6800XT than it does on a RTX3080 (up to 12%  better, as per Digital Foundry's performance benchmark - see screenshot  and video link below).\n\n[AMD 6800XT on left with 61fps - Nvidia RTX3080 on right with 56fps](https://preview.redd.it/eruzko9mwy471.jpg?width=1289&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fcbb478a1bcc940bd8c564b5d6b6ace551aa401)\n\n(digital foundry's benchmarks) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99VwDGyLg0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99VwDGyLg0)\n\nUnreal  Engine 5 (with Lumen) will make Nvidia Ray Tracing a thing of the past.  This software solution is much more efficient at managing illumination,  making it available for non-RTX hardware.\n\nIn  addition, enthusiasts are really pumped with AMD's latest presentation  at Computex, where they presented Fidelity FX SuperResolution. It aims  to provide up to 2x performance while super sampling images up to 4K.  And the kicker is that this solution will be available to ALL.\n\nIntel's  Raja Koduri (Head of Intel GPU, formerly an AMD employee) has already  confirmed they are looking into AMD's Fidelity FX SR (as per his twitter  post days ago): [https://twitter.com/Rajaontheedge/status/1399964541291622407?ref\\_src=twsrc%5Etfw](https://twitter.com/Rajaontheedge/status/1399964541291622407?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nSo yeah, AMD is the future of GAMING.\n\nBut on the stock analysis front, AMD has also begun its climb towards previous highs.\n\nIt has made a huge recovery since my latest post, when it was trading in the low $70's.\n\nJust imagine that AMD is trading at a Price/Earnings multiple of 34, with a market cap of $98.7B\n\nNvidia is trading at a P/E of 84 (over twice as much), with a market cap of $444B (over 4 times more).\n\nBut when you look at the financials, the differences shrink.\n\nOn Revenue, AMD has sales of $9.7B and net profits of $2.5B. Nvidia sold $16.6B for a net $4.3B.\n\nHow does that support Nvidia being over 4 times more expensive than AMD? It just doesn't.\n\nIf AMD were to trade at the same multiples: EPS of 2.38 \\* NVIDIA's P/E of 84.28 = $200 per share.\n\nAt $200 per share, AMD's market cap would be $243B... STLL HALF OF NVIDIA!!!! (WTF?!?!).\n\nThink about it, it is bound to close the distance towards $200 per share in the next 12 months.\n\nThe reasons are simple: Tesla, Valve, Unreal Engine 5, Ryzen 3D stacking and 50% growth for 2021.\n\nThe Xilinx deal WILL CLOSE in the next 6 months. THE BREAKOUT is IMMINENT!!!\n\nTo summarize, the product pipeline is AMAZING, not to mention the leaks on RDNA3 and Ryzen 4.\n\nThe new clientele is incredible: TESLA and Valve, added to Microsoft and Sony.\n\nJust imagine Xilinx FPGA accelerators integrated to AMD's Intellectual Property. Fuel the rockets!!!\n\nREMEMBER: In a matter of months you will be kicking yourself for ignoring this post!\n\nThe MOON is for amateurs.... WE'RE GOING TO MARS BABY!!!... with TESLA AND AMD!!!\n\nMARS - THE RED PLANET... WITH LISA AND ELON. PRIMATES AND APES TO COLONIZE IT IN 2022!!!\n\n..... ALL ABOARD!!!!",

        "selftext": "I've seen a lot of people suggesting BB's time has come and gone after their rise and fall last week. I'm here to show you that BB is still massively undervalued. I **really** like this stock, so below I've consolidated some of my favorite DD, with links at the end if you'd like to read more.\n\n# Products &amp; Customers\n\n* BlackBerry isn't just a phone company any more. They provide best in class cybersecurity.\n* BlackBerry's most notable product is QNX, an RTOS with several applications. [Read here for more.](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le53ol/comprehensive_guide_about_bb_and_how_it_shall/)\n* In December of last year, Amazon announced a multi-year global agreement with BlackBerry QNX and developed IVY, a cloud-connected smart vehicle data platform. IVY allows automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data and create actionable insights from that date. It's possibilities are endless, and I highly recommend reading more on Amazon's initial announcement.\n* OK, so what the fuck does the point above mean? It means that **right now, electric vehicles are a gold rush, and BlackBerry is the one selling picks and shovels.** Through Amazon, IVY is going to become an integral part of the EV process.\n* The market is sucking the dick of EV manufacturers, but EV production is low margin and low scale. **BlackBerry IVY is data monetization, which is high margin and has unlimited scale.** Within a few years, BlackBerry will be making much more than the auto manufacturers they're partnered with.\n* Blackberry QNX is used by 23 of the world's top 25 electric vehicle OEMs.\n* BlackBerry targets more than just EVs though. They also have or are developing products for healthcare, financial services, government markets, energy, gas, oil, and smart grid connected transportation.\n\n# Cybersecurity Leader\n\n* BB offers best-in-class security, safety, and reliability. 18 of the G20 governments are customers, and they are the only software company to attain various security certifications from the US Govt.\n* Ransomware attacks have begun to impact American businesses like never before. Today, the commerce secretary stated ransomware attacks are here to stay, and that businesses should plan accordingly.\n* You know that oil pipeline that was taken out by DarkSide ransomware and caused oil shortages across the southeast U.S? That wouldn't have happened if Colonial Pipeline were using BlackBerry. Something tells me companies won't be making that mistake in the future.\n* According to Frost &amp; Sullivan Research, BlackBerry addresses 96% of cyber threats, and 77% of Fortune 100 financial companies use BlackBerry software.\n\n[Here's a list of BB Certifications obtained in 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/qey899yxnp371.png?width=1259&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f51e571ce7afcaf17126b2c168cb3f7a37343c35)\n\n# Some Basics and Fundamentals\n\n* BlackBerry has an \\~$8bn market cap with $1bn+ in yearly revenue and $800m in cash.\n* Since 2016, the number of QNX products has grown from 50 million to 175 million.\n* BB owns \\~38,000 patents worth approximately $450 million.\n* BB recently won a lawsuit against Facebook. I am unable to find the details, but most estimates are for between $1bn - $5bn total, paid over the course of a few years. BlackBerry's current market cap is only $8bn...\n* Blackberry has a strong customer base or critical infrastructure already, and their pivot from hardware to software means continuous subscription revenue.\n* **If BlackBerry had the same market cap as competitor Crowdstrike -** **who it outperforms** **- it would have a stock price of $83.** That's just taking into consideration one aspect of it's business model.\n* [Vanguard has doubled their position since Dec 31/2020.](https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lzw0pn/vanguard_is_bullish_on_bb/)\n\n# TL;DR: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 BB is going past the moon and into Alpha Centauri.

        "selftext": "First let me point out that I don't have any positions in Facebook.  I did however apply for options trading on Fidelity today for just this reason.  Btw, is it just me or do those option prices look steep?\n\nTL-DR: I think Facebook is dropping hard in the next 4-6 month.  YouTube is screwed as well, but I won't bet against Google.  I know FB has a ton of bright people working for them, but Apple is attacking their business model and it seems to be working.\n\nLittle background here.  I work for a D2C (direct to consumer) company and am very involved with marketing spend allocaction, analysis etc.  Basically Facebook has been a boon to these types of marketers for the past couple of years.  We spend on avg 400k-600k per month in Facebook advertising.  It's very profitable until late May when Apple fully rolled out iOS 14.1.\n\niOS 14.1 is essentially a first strike attach against FB &amp; YT.\n\nPerhaps you've seen the latest Apple ads toting how great they are for privacy.  Here's what's really going on.  Advertisers like FB &amp; YT are able to make money by tracking user behavour to deliver ads that will convert.  Apple decided to throw a huge wrench in their business model....and look like they are the champion of privacy at the same time - genius.  Seriously, this was a master stroke move.\n\nHere's the reality of what I'm seeing and have heard the same from other marketers.\n\nFacebook &amp; YouTubes advertising platforms are basically broken.  I mean campaigns that we have run for 6mo's just stopped working.  We are cutting spend by 50%.  We want to spend more, but we can't justify it.  Not only that, but it's getting more expensive.  I'm not sure if this is due to other parties trying to spend their way out of the poor performance or FB increasing rates to make up for advertiser drop off.\n\nNot every company has in depth analytics like we do.  Some can go months before they realize that they just burned a pile of money.  Side note - this is great for companies like Pinterest that are intent based.  Similar to how search works...they know you are interested in certain subject so they send you relevant ads.  Also, Google search campaigns are still performing well.\n\nHere's my view on what's happening w/FB &amp; YT.  If an iOS user upgrades to iOS 14+ they are automatically oped out from being tracked on the apps they use.  I don't know about Safari, but f you launch FB or YT on your iPhone then you look like a brand new user from an advertisers point of view.\n\nSerious advertisers use a funnel approach to FB advertising.  Top of funnel (TOF) is used for brand awareness.  Bottom of funnel (BOF) is used to target people who interacted with your ad.  BTW, an interaction could mean you hoverered over the ad, not just clicks.  With this new reality, advertisers cannot re-target iOS users on FB and YT effectively for BOF ads.  This is huge.  Now we're stuck with some basic demographic targeting for ads with no intent data points.  It's like every FB user who has opted out of tracking looks like a brand new user with not history.\n\nFrom FB &amp; YT's point of view - every iOS user has no historical data to use in targeting.  You still have your friend list and YT subscriptions, but they can't use that data to target ads.  This might be fine for brand marketing but it doesn't work for performance marketing.  Performance marketing means we want you to interact with the ad and buy something.\n\nNow let's talk about attribution.  When FB/YT delivers you an ad, they will track whether you eventually bought the product - think the normal window is 28 days.  This means if you see an ad for a t-shirt, then go to the t-shirt company's website a week later and buy it...FB/YT take credit for the sale.  Now a good marketr knows that FB/YT doesn't deserve all the credit.  You may have advertised to them on some other medium...but FB/YT does deserve some credit.  If they hadn't seen the ad on FB/YT first they would never have eventually bought the shirt.\n\niOS 14 iis changing this as well.  I think the window is 7 days now...but might be less.\n\nMy ompany's sales are down 35% since iOS 14 rolled out.  Not only that but our FB/YT spend is down approx 40%.  In fact, I remember before the rollout happened our FB rep reached out to inquire what our spend budget was going to be for the year.  This is not normal.  Usually these platforms make you come to them and beg...they never reach out...and never ever for a budget plan.  We told them we planned on spending the same unless performanc changed..  Well, we're cutting spend by 50% and I have to imagin we're not the only ones.  Don't get me wrong - we want to spend more.  It's just not working out.\n\nAlso, has anyone noticed how much stock Zuck has been selling lately?  I think he's already doubled last year's number.\n\nOh, and FB nearly hit their all time high today.  Really, how is this possible.\n\nBTW - I have not interest in placing bets against Google.   Who in their right mind would place bets agains both of those giants.\n\nHere's my guess w/FB. I think they will come in a little low on earning on 7/19.  They have been increasing rates and traditionally they are the best place to advertise.  Howver, I think the cracks will really show on Q3 earning and continue to deteriorate in Q4.\n\nMy question is - if you had 20K-40K to invest in this scenario what would you do?  I'm thinking put options winter 2021 or Jan 2022.  Im assuming the stock is going to drop a hundred bucks between now and then.   How can I maximize my play with this set of assumptions?",

        "selftext": "**TL;DR** Unmatched earnings and fundamentals in their sector, Extremely high options activity/Immediate Gamma sq potential, Bubbling sentiment on WSB with low float, Fantastic chart/technicals, 22% short interest or more\n\nLet me start off by saying, there's been a lot of p/d\u2019s going around right now, this is unfortunate because legitimate tickers get lost in the mix. Saying something is memeable 'ItS a PlAnE cOmPaNy its LITERALLY tAkInG oFf Lol' or  'iT rHyMEs wItH YOLO' is not DD. They might spike up but they will fall down. I've been around since retards yolod their life savings on Riteaid, if I post about a stock here I'm holding it for the long term because the chart will go up. [Yesterday I posted about $GOEV,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0k89j/car_wars_episode_ev_a_canoo_hope_why_goev_can_be/) while it took a hit from its high  it's still up over 10% from the post and I expect it to continue growing, it's a solid company with good fundamentals and everything I wrote about it holds up, same for $ASO. \n\n**What is $ASO?** \n\nASO or Academy Sports + Outdoors is a sporting goods store that recently IPO'd and has not stopped it's steady traversal upwards since. With new institutional backing and investors plus unmatched earnings for its sector and a nice short float, I believe this stock has one of the brightest futures on this sub and it's JUST starting to get noticed.\n\n**First things first, short interest!** \n\nEverybody likes a good *word that rhymes with fort sneeze*, $ASO short interest is currently 22% of the float. Compare that to their 1 mo 3mo or 1 yr chart and you can see that the shorts have CONSISTENTLY been BTFO. This will keep happening and analysts agree, it is rated BUY by every major analyst from barchart to fidelity to nasdaq. It's honestly a mystery why no one here is paying attention to it but once it starts  flying it wont stop until it hits $60-$70 where it belongs. Along with a **small market cap** this will move the stock quickly.  \n\n**Unusual options activity** - Look at the option flow for the [past week](https://i.postimg.cc/02q48KLt/bullish-call-flow.png) and [month,](https://i.postimg.cc/fyHSg9Xw/bullish-call-flow-1-month.png) **100% bullish**, this has heavy implications since its actually at a 5% dip over the past week. A heavy influx of buying could potentially cause a gamma sq for this Friday as options writers (and theres\u2019 been a lot of them) have to cover. [For more on a **gamma sq** look at this post by u/hyptisx where he did some math for it to happen by **tomorrow**](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o14jei/aso_this_week/) More unusual options via Nasdaq; [\u201cASO options are showing a volume of 17,370 contracts thus far today. That number of contracts represents approximately 1.7 million underlying shares, working out to a sizeable 75.7% of ASO's average daily trading volume over the past month, of 2.3 million shares. Particularly high volume was seen for the $40 strike call option expiring June 18, 2021, with 4,854 contracts trading so far today, representing approximately 485,400 underlying shares of ASO.\u201d](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/noteworthy-tuesday-option-activity%3A-rapt-aso-scco-2021-06-15)\n\n**Bubbling Sentiment on wsb** - $ASO doesn't need wsb to take off, it's going to do that based off solid fundamentals but it can get started much earlier if the word spreads. It has already begun due to multiple good DD's like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwysob/aso_your_yolos_dont_have_to_be_retardeda/) [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvg2py/aso_just_chris_brownd_earnings_has_a_si_of_225/) and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0udtf/now_that_shit_has_somewhat_calmed_down_here_lets/) amongst other. You\u2019ve heard murmurs on the daily thread, don\u2019t ignore it and get mad later, It will be on the top of the FOMO list soon enough.\n\n**Low implied volatility** - This means July calls are still cheap for apes with plenty of time to reach them. June for a pure YOLO.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nNow on to the stuff you probably don\u2019t care about but should because it\u2019s the difference between stocks that crash and ones that don\u2019t. \n\n**Long Term and Fundamentals** \n\nLOOK AT THAT FUCKIN P/E. $ASO has blown earnings out of the water pretty consistently but last quarter was their best yet. With a **P/E of 10** (which makes this stock insanely undervalued) they currently have a forecasted growth of near **triple for 2022** Like I said earlier **every** analyst says this is a buy, stop falling for overpriced stocks with no fundamentals, $ASO has solid earnings and a terrific debt position. \n\n**Earnings** Earnings were absolutely blown out of the water this last quarter:\n\n- Adjusted income of $182.5 million vs Q1 2020 $400,000 income \n\n- EPS estimate of 0.84 vs **actual eps of 1.89**\n   \n- Revenues up 40% year over the year to $1.6 billion with an estimated 1.51 Billion expected to a **1.58 billion actual** \n\n**Charts/Technicals**\n\nHere are some links that you should check out if you like stats. Some of them are from the /u/birbigd99 DD post which was very informative. \n\n[Comprehensive DD by Refinitiv](https://www.scribd.com/document/511345009/ASO-DD)\n\n[Profit Margin](https://preview.redd.it/z3znha6kzh471.png?width=1207&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=577bdce2415b6317c94c72d7a4bca906bed474cb)\n\n[Price targets and Analyst ratings](https://preview.redd.it/m7d8xn7ibj471.png?width=974&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e46010163543da2e344370cde66f0d1ee887811f)\n\n[For you TA retards, ever see a healthier chart?](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASO)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**IN CONCLUSION** \n\n$ASO is long term consistent winning stock with short term potential for a huge take off. The only reason it's low at the moment is because it's new and retail hasn't really caught on to it but that's starting to change, get in while you can boys. \n\n**I am not a financial advisor, please do your research.

        "selftext": "Here's a summary. Full DD below.\n\n&gt;Over the last week a handful of geniuses in the Burryologists subreddit cracked a code from a Michael Burry tweet that hypes a cannabis penny stock called Kush Co that's about to uplist to Nasdaq via merger with Greenlane.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Right now Kushco trades at 1x sales / 1x book which is as low as you'll see for a company that's EBITDA positive, not in debt, has good mgmt, and tracking a rapidly growing industry like US cannabis. Greenlane, the company its about to merge with, is similarly cheap. Basically this is an deep value play combined with a near-term Nasdaq catalyst.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Most US cannabis companies like Curaleaf / Green Thumb etc are \"plant-touching\" so they have to trade on a small Canadian exchange called the CSE and have almost 0 institutional investment. Kushco and Greenlane aren't plant-touching so post-merger the combined entity will be added to Nasdaq. \"Ancillary\" cannabis stocks like Kushco, Greenlane, GrowGen, and Scotts Miracle Gro are the \"picks and shovels\" of the industry; they're a bet on the space instead of a horse in the race.  \nHedge funds can't buy Kushco yet but will be able to once it uplists to Nasdaq. The agreement says the merger will happen in \"late Q2 or early Q3\" which means any day now. There's a shareholder vote this Thursday which is expected to approve of it, so maybe it'll happen soon after that.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For years Kushco hasn't had access to serious capital since it hasn't been large enough to list on a major exchange, then in late 2019 we had the vape crisis which ultimately was caused by unrelated black market vapes but still took a toll. Now Kushco is outta debt and EBITDA positive and about to join a major exchange where hedge funds will be allowed to buy it. It'll also be over 2x as large ($170m today; $360m after the deal), which'll also mean more hedge funds will be able to buy it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Valuation for its most comparable peers GrowGen and Scotts Miracle Grow are 5-6 times higher than Kushco's &amp; Greenlane's. Since GrowGen joined Nasdaq in December 2019 it's up 10x. With the scale and access to capital this merger will bring, I think Kushco should be about to re-rate.\n\nProps to Redditer Bernardsman and the other geniuses in the subreddit Burryologists who were the first people to connect these dots. Something he didn't cover that I'll cover here is some background on the US cannabis industry. Key to have that context.\n\nSo Michael Burry of Big Short fame sometimes speaks in code (which he calls psyops) on Twitter to the handful of hardcore followers that are paying attention.\n\nEvery once in a while he'll activate his Twitter account, tweet, delete tweets, and then de-activate his account again. Whenever he tweets he deletes them 24 hours later.\n\nA few weeks ago he activated his account and posted these tweets below, deleting them the next day. A few days ago he deactivated his account again. First 2 screenshots from Bernardsman. The third tweet is the key one.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/792fx5nyf8871.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a72414b3e82df2cde33c231d590e0469eda5472\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/10lkp3rzf8871.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85c77a6cf86ba9ae7b796805f1a8d135fb37fc2f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Burryologist](https://preview.redd.it/lccxsaw0g8871.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=492551beede1b37221c59e04f39a25e8996cc86f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Burryologist showing us the way.](https://preview.redd.it/dmp42px3g8871.png?width=1284&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=163ab5f22b9bdb127d6c8521e284c8ddb4b1e48a)\n\nHe keeps saying \"knowing saves half the battle\". But the phrase is \"knowing IS half the bettle\". Why did he change it?\n\n**Knowing Saves Half the Battle = KSHB, the ticker for Kushco**\n\nI wouldn't have picked up anything by the first two tweets other than that he's a weird dude, but the last one makes it clear - IF you understand US cannabis.\n\nBackground on US cannabis.\n\n&gt;99% of hedge funds &amp; mutual funds still aren't able to invest in \"plant-touching\" US cannabis stocks since compliance departments think it could be considered money laundering as long as pot's Schedule 1 federally. After Dems won the US Senate Georgia runoffs in January, hedgies started jumping in which sent the whole US cannabis industry higher. Then in February the whole industry sold off for no known reason - turns out this was because of mass de-risking through the hedge fund space following the collapse of Archegos Capital. (The story of Archegos is that this guy Bill Hwang took on 100x leverage with multiple major banks, causing 6 of them to lose over $10 billion and nearly blowing up the financial system.) After that, many banks pulled back on their prime allowances to hedge funds and mutual funds, forcing them to sell plant-touching US cannabis stocks. The Safe Banking Act will change that but who knows when we get that - maybe this fall, maybe next year.  \nSo now we have a situation where hedge funds want to get into US cannabis but can't, and since Kushco has partnerships with a lot of the big players in US cannabis Kushco is about to give them another way to access the industry legally, similar to GrowGen and Scotts Miracle Gro which both trade at expensive multiples.  \nNow to Kushco specifically.\n\nSo Burry is obviously talking about US cannabis, but what stock trades at 1x price to sales? Here's a list of the cheapest US cannabis stocks. Our boy Kushco comes in at #3 - trading at a stupid cheap multiples of 0.9x sales / 1.2x book.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1wur8lkag8871.png?width=693&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f8a7de5af81b6c15643e9d29b4ce924c5b5bc39\n\nWhat do you know, Danny Moses (Burry's former head trader also from the Big Short) is on Kushco's board.\n\nSo Michael Burry is talking about Kushco and it's super cheap. So what? Why won't it just stay cheap?\n\n**Because Kushco is about to join the Nasdaq any day now via a merger with a similar ancillary company called Greenlane, which is also near the top of the list of the cheapest US cannabis stocks.**\n\nHow can Kushco join the Nasdaq before the Safe Banking Act?\n\nBecause Kushco is an *ancillary* cannabis company - meaning it supports the US cannabis industry with vapes/packaging/other supplies but doesn't touch the plant. After merging with Greenlane it'll be large enough for Nasdaq.\n\nAfter getting capital-starved on OTC pink sheets for years, Kushco is about to merge with Greenlane and uplist to Nasdaq. When it does, hedge funds will have a new way to access the growing US cannabis market. Seems to me a near-term multi-bagger is possible if not likely. The two most similar ancillary cannabis companies on US exchanges are GrowGen and Scotts Miracle Grow, which trade at about 5-6x the valuation of Kushco/Greenlane. With the scale this merger will give these companies, I think 4x sales is easily in reach.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rmq43vkcg8871.png?width=733&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bea4fa0129a0f7ebb3b998147a1252391941818\n\nHere's what happened when GrowGen joined Nasdaq in December 2019. GrowGen is up 10x since then.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h08wpa0eg8871.png?width=944&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b02014a86c86d631f76d37752848c932eee3aeea\n\nWhen will the merger happen? According to public records \"late Q2 or early Q3\", and we just learned there's gunna be a shareholder vote on it this Thursday July 1 which is expected to pass, so the merger should be very soon.\n\n**Merger arbitrage**\n\nThe merger spread slightly favors Kushco shareholders over Greenlane. If the deal were to happen right now, Kushco shareholders would get a slightly better deal (+4.6%).\n\nFrom the agreement: \"Kushco shareholders will get 0.2546 shares of Greenlane for each Kushco share they hold.\" Math: Merger spread=(4.38\\*0.2546) / 1.11=1.0464\n\nFYI - Kushco is buyable pre-merger on brokers like Fidelity, Schwab, Etrade etc. On Robinhood and Webull, only Greenlane is available pre-merger.\n\n\\#capisce?",

        "selftext": "&gt;Hey everyone! I run a small YouTube stock research channel (~45k subscribers). I post videos every week, and this week I\u2019m focusing on the complicated Pershing Square Tontine Holdings deal in which it\u2019s acquiring a 10% stake in Universal Music Group. **I know this topic has been discussed to death in this subreddit, but I also know that sometimes people are able to learn better from different teachers and when seeing information presented in different ways, and if I can help one person better understand why this deal is actually amazing, then I\u2019ll have fulfilled my purpose.** The full video is about 26 minutes long and I\u2019ve included a link at the end of this post, but I wanted to post a slightly edited, more reddit-appropriate version of the transcript here in /r/SPACs to facilitate discussion.\n\n\n***CHEAP, UNNECESSARILY SENSATIONALIZED CLAIM FOR ATTENTION*** Assuming this deal with Universal Music Group goes through, Pershing Square Tontine Holdings has one of the greatest, if not the greatest, risk-reward profile of nearly any asset currently available in investing.\n\n\n**WHY DO I CARE ABOUT $PSTH SUDDENLY?**\n\n\nI was working overtime all week and was beat out on making this video by a damned sock puppet because of my stupid desk job, but I still wanted to put out my take on the merger. I want to share with you my explanation of Pershing Square Tontine Holdings and why I am absolutely in love with the SPAC deal Bill Ackman has set up with Universal Music Group. Just a reminder, I am NOT a financial professional. All information herein is for entertainment purposes only. I was not holding any $PSTH before the deal was announced, but when I was reading the details of the deal on June 4th while simultaneously watching the stock price drop 12% in a single trading session, I was stupefied as to why people were closing out of their positions and I opened my own. Full disclosure before I proceed, I\u2019m currently holding 324 shares of $PSTH, and I\u2019m planning to continue adding to that position any time the price dips under $23/share until the deal is finalized and the ink is dry.\n\n\nOutside of the risk of the deal falling through, I cannot fathom why people sold out of their positions. Honestly, I think it\u2019s just because the deal is complicated. Most SPACs are shell companies that collect money from hopeful investors, merge with a target company, and investors simply get 1:1 shares of that new target company. That\u2019s kindergarten-level math. 1=1. This deal is more like pre-calc, and since most of you were probably asleep through pre-calc, I\u2019ll speak slowly and break it down so you can digest it without a tummy ache during your wittle nappy wappy today. I have this post formatted, so skip ahead to the deal section if you don\u2019t want to read while I ramble about Ackman, why PSTH is special, and the unique market conditions that brought us this opportunity.\n\n\nThis deal is complicated, yes, but that isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. Inception, great movie, definitely complicated. That spinning top at the end? Yeah\u2026makes you think. Too complicated can get messy, though. Think Tenet. All that timey-wimey stuff requires way too many rewatches to hash out. Thankfully this deal is closer to the Inception side of the complicated spectrum than the Tenet side.\n\n\nBefore we get started, I want to talk a little about Bill Ackman. Part of the appeal of this deal involves having a certain amount of faith in Bill Ackman to get shit done, so it\u2019s important to understand who he is. After that I\u2019ll briefly go over what made Pershing Square Tontine Holdings a special SPAC from the start, and then we\u2019ll get into the deal with Universal Music Group.\n\n\n**WHO IS BILL ACKMAN?**\n\n\nSo, who is Bill SPACman? He\u2019s a deep value investor who looks up to Warren Buffet. His fund, Pershing Square Holdings, outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in 2020 by 50%, and this is primarily due to a single bet. Ackman watched COVID-19 spread from China in the end of 2019, knew some shit was about to go down, and paid a $27 million premium to buy credit protection on global investment-grade and high-yield indices. The dude bought insurance. I know it\u2019s easy to hate hedge funds, but this whole thing can give you a huge justice boner. It\u2019s one of those rare times in history where the insurance company ACTUALLY had to pay out a fair amount for a freak occurrence, a black swan event. I wonder if the underwriters on that policy got fired? Ackman was effectively betting the debt bubble would burst and investors would heavily de-risk before and during the impending stock market crash. He was right and turned that $27 million into $2.6 billion by March 2020. Depending on the metric you use, this is widely considered the greatest, or one of the greatest trades of all time. Bill\u2019s not perfect, either. He lost a ton of money shorting Herbalife on principle because he thought it was a multi-level marketing scam. He\u2019s right, Herbalife is an MLM scam, and you should unfriend Karen from your hometown on Facebook before she contacts you out of the blue to try her miracle weight-loss supplements. Even when he loses he wins.\n\n\n**WHAT IS ACKMAN\u2019S TRACK RECORD WITH PERSHING SQUARE HOLDINGS?**\n\n\nAckman isn\u2019t a one-hit wonder, though. Pershing Square Holdings\u2019 performance since he founded the fund in 2004 has had consistently higher net returns and outperforms the S&amp;P 500 index on most years. He doesn\u2019t use some spray-and-pray method, either. As of the most recent 2020-year-end investor presentation, 96% of the fund is comprised of Index CDS, obviously after that trade, their own Pershing Square Tontine Holdings SPAC, Lowe\u2019s, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Starbucks, Agilent Technologies, Restaurant Brands International, Hilton Worldwide, Berkshire Hathaway, Fannie May &amp; Freddie Mac. There\u2019s nothing speculative in there, just deep value when he bought and solid performance since then. Besides, it\u2019s Chipotle and Starbucks. Who doesn\u2019t like burritos, guac, and Pumpkin Spice Lattes? I wouldn\u2019t bet against that. Neither is Bill.\n\n\nAlso worth noting, Bill\u2019s idol, Warren Buffett, is 90 and everything we know about human lifespans indicates that the mantle for the Greatest Value Investor is soon to be up for grabs. Bill Ackman\u2019s a 55-year-old, 6\u20195\u201d, svelte silver fox, and he\u2019s more than ready to surpass his idol.\n\n\n**WHY IS $PSTH SUCH A UNIQUE SPAC?**\n\n\nLet\u2019s talk about what made PSTH a unique SPAC from the beginning, one that people have been genuinely excited about. For starters, most people would notice the $20 NAV. *Before someone calls me out on this, I know the NAV is slightly higher than $20 because of the tontine warrants, but for the sake of simplicity, just let me have this.* Most SPACs have a NAV of $10, but PSTH doubled that up. With SPACs, if you don\u2019t like the target company for the merger, you can redeem your shares at a minimum of NAV. This higher NAV instantly gave investors of PSTH the impression they were big-game hunting and were going to pull a big company. Ackman himself said from the beginning he was searching for a mature company that could be had at a value.\n\n\nThere are some other aspects of the PSTH structure that were wholly unique. To understand these, imagine you\u2019re a company that agrees to go public through a SPAC merger. The SPAC team tells you they have $1 billion dollars available, pending redemptions. If the public holders of the SPAC don\u2019t like the merger target, there\u2019s nothing stopping them from simply redeeming their shares and walking away, leaving the SPAC\u2019s trust AND target company with less money. How do you think that makes the target company feel? Probably like shit. They\u2019re getting less money than they wanted.\n\n\nPSTH addressed this in a couple ways. Pershing Square made a committed purchase of $1 billion dollars into the SPAC, effectively setting a floor of $1 billion for any merger. This SPAC was their second-largest single holding in the Pershing Square Hedge Fund by year-end 2020, as we discussed earlier. Most SPACs have what are called \u201cpromote shares\u201d that are redeemable by the directors as a way for them to pay themselves. PSTH structured its \u201cpromote shares\u201d differently, though. Ackman, the directors, and even Pershing Square can\u2019t access these promote shares unless the share price hits $24 within the next 10-years POST combination close. In other words, they\u2019re incentivized to make a great deal, otherwise they\u2019re getting jack squat.\n\n\n**WHAT THE HOTH IS A TAUNTAUN WARRANT?**\n\n\nThe final way PSTH incentivized investors to not redeem upon the merger announcement were the tontine warrants. A tontine is financial structure dating back to the 1600s in which a group of investors pooled their assets for SOME BIG, EXPENSIVE THING to give them more purchasing power. As those investors died off, the pool went to the survivors, giving people a larger piece of the pie over time. Don\u2019t quote me on this, but I think this structure died off because people just started murderizing each other with pistol duels and poisoned beer\u2026if I\u2019m wrong, at least that\u2019s gonna continue being my head cannon.\n\n\nWhen you purchase 1 share of PSTH, you receive 1/9th of a tontine warrant, effectively a fractional future share. If you DON\u2019T redeem your share before the deal closes, then you\u2019ll get another 2/9th tontine warrant\u2026adding fractions brings that to 1/3rd of a tontine warrant. The kicker here is the survivorship of not redeeming. All the warrants are pooled, so people who redeem lose out on that additional 2/9th warrant per share and that pool ends up getting split among the \u201csurvivors\u201d. By the way, this is why people recommend holding shares of PSTH in multiples of 9\u2026usually people buy stocks to trade options or something in lots of 100, but with PSTH you want to do it in lots of 108 so you can get those clean tontine warrants and still trade options with 100 of them. Also, you probably shouldn\u2019t trade options on this between now and the deal\u2019s conclusion\u2026not financial advice, though.\n\n\nAll in all, these unique aspects of PSTH made it so merger or deal targets would be more incentivized to get into bed with sexy, silver fox Ackman because there would be a higher guaranteed floor and fewer redemptions.\n\n\n**WHY DID IT TAKE ACKMAN A YEAR TO FIND A DEAL FOR $PSTH?**\n\n\nSomething unexpected happened, though. The US started printing money in an effort to out-compete Venezuela for the highest-quality, softest, toilet paper currency. This made debt incredibly cheap, so companies could just borrow what they wanted, and no one wanted to give up partial ownership of their company to Ackman through a deal. PSTH filed its initial prospectus on July 21, 2020, and it had a 2-year-long timed life to find a target, strike a deal, and make it rain for the shareholders, otherwise the SPAC would dissolve and Ackman\u2019s reputation would take a huge hit.\n\n\nOriginally there were rumors PSTH was looking to take Air BnB public, but the Air BnB execs smartly realized that with all the money being printed, traditional investment vehicles were being dumpstered by low rates, I mean, come on, a 0.01% return on a savings account? A 0.1% return on a 24-month CD? Please. So people were just throwing all their funny money into equities and the stonk market. Air BnB took advantage of this, went public through an IPO instead of a SPAC merger, and retained its internal ownership structure.\n\n\n**ENTER UNIVERSAL MUSIC GROUP**\n\n\nTick tock, tick tock, summer 2021 came around and Ackman was down to around 1 year to strike a deal. Enter Universal Music Group. The largest pure-music play in the world, a nearly incalculable TAM with streaming services, sales, and concerts, and a stable of artists that\u2019s so large and diverse that it\u2019s confusing. The Beatles. The Rolling Stones. Queen. Taylor Swift. Post Malone. The Weeknd. You want to talk about a moat? Music is really a three horse race with UMG, Warner Music Group, and Sony. Literally every other music label in the world is classified as an \u201cIndie Label\u201d, and all those Indie labels still had lower revenue than UMG in 2020. Music is art, and art is an idea. Labels own the ideas, not the artists, and labels get paid royalties in perpetuity. UMG gets paid every time one of their songs is played on Spotify. UMG gets paid every time a low-effort Tik-Tok is put out there with one of their songs\u2026seriously, Tik-Tok is like budget YouTube. It\u2019s worse than Vine was. Lowest common denominator. ANYWAYS, UMG has over 100 years of royalties coming in on their catalog of music. On top of that, one of the more prominent UMG artists, The Weeknd, just auctioned an NFT of his previously unreleased music for millions of dollars. If UMG enters the NFT space, which isn\u2019t a stretch for a company effectively licensing intellectual property for usage, the revenue possibilities are ludicrous. Cash. Printing. Machine.\n\n\n2020 was a bad year for music, though. No concerts, few new albums, and generally less merchandise consumption. Thanks, COVID. UMG\u2019s majority owners, France\u2019s Vivendi and China\u2019s Tencent wanted to take the company public to raise some money, I\u2019m assuming this is mostly Vivendi\u2019s decision because of their nearly catastrophic debt level, but they were facing a major tax hit if they did. No one likes paying taxes, and y\u2019all know damn well huge corporations go to extremes to avoid paying their fair share. This is the part where Bill Ackman heroically enters the picture with PSTH.\n\n\n**THIRD PARTY VALUATIONS OF UNIVERSAL MUSIC GROUP**\n\n\nIn 2019 J.P. Morgan valued UMG at $50 billion. That same J.P. Morgan researcher, Daniel Kerven, just teased a near-future blue sky valuation of UMG at $120 billion in the spring of 2021. In 2020 Goldman Sachs valued UMG at $36 billion. Goldman Sachs\u2019 analyst Lisa Yang just authored a report at the end of April 2021 valuing UMG at $53 billion. Bill Ackman\u2019s brass balls negotiated a deal with Vivendi that valued UMG at $41 billion and PSTH would be taking over 10% ownership in the company for $4.1 billion. It\u2019s important to note this is not a SPAC merger. This is a business combination at this point. Also, if we completely ignore J.P. Morgan\u2019s $120 billion blue sky valuation and focus on Goldman\u2019s more practical $53 billion valuation, that\u2019s STILL 30% higher than the valuation Ackman struck this deal for. Remember that number. 30% discount. PSTH is buying a 10% stake in UMG for an EBITDA of 21 when a fair multiple would be in the 25 to 28 range for the EBITDA. Warren Buffett Junior right here. More value than a Bluelight Special in a failing K-Mart in the 90s.\n\n\n**THE DEAL: OVERVIEW**\n\n\nSO WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN FOR PSTH SHAREHOLDERS? What are we getting out of this? In the abridged and totally miscontextualized words of Thanos, everything. Following the completion of the transaction, a PSTH shareholder will own three separately traded securities, a UMG ordinary share valued at approximately $14.75 per share, a share of PSTH Remainco valued at approximately $5.25 per share, and one transferrable 5-year right per share of a SPAR. What are these?\n\n\n**THE DEAL: UMG SHARES**\n\n\nThe easiest one to understand is the UMG share at $14.75. This is the closest thing to normal for a standard SPAC, kind of like the 1:1 thing we talked about earlier. \u201cBut wait, I thought the NAV was $20? We\u2019re paying $20 to get $14.75? What kind of lopsided crap is that?\u201d Well, yes, but, no, not at all. That $14.75 is the pre-IPO price. Historically, what do we know about pre-IPO prices? They are much lower than IPO prices because this is when the institutional buyers get in, before retail gets boned on the opening day of trading. That\u2019s right, holders of PSTH are getting in on institution day! Look at me, I am the institution now. Also, keep in mind the valuation. We\u2019re getting at LEAST a 30% discount on the most recent valuations of UMG, so IF that valuation were to be applied to the share price in a direct relationship, and I know I\u2019m vastly oversimplifying this and probably mathing wrong, $14.75 + 30% = a fair value of $19.18 on day 1 of trading. There\u2019s already value. In the immortal words of Billy Mays, BUT WAIT, THERE\u2019S MORE!\n\n\n**THE DEAL: REMAINCO SHARES**\n\n\nPershing Square Holdings is buying a total of $1.6 billion of PSTH; I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s in addition to what they already have, or they already bought it, but that\u2019s the total. PSTH has $4 billion in trust, so the total rises to $5.6 billion. That 10% of UMG is going to cost $4.1 billion, so\u2026there\u2019s a remainder. What happens to the remaining $1.5 billion? R E M A I N C O. Terrible name. Simple purpose. This is going to continue to trade under the ticker PSTH, and it will function like a mini-SPAC with no expiration, unlike normal SPACs with 2-year shelf-lives. Bill Ackman is going to use this to merge with OR strike a deal with another company that\u2019s yet-to-be-disclosed. A trust of $1.5 billion dollars still makes this one of the largest SPAC shells on the market, and it\u2019s just the scraps of this deal. WE\u2019RE NOT DONE YET!\n\n\n**THE DEAL: SPAR SHARES**\n\n\nIf you choose not to redeem your shares and choose to follow this deal through, which, I mean, already, $19.18 + $5.25 = $24.43, and that\u2019s not even counting any discount PSTH Remainco will get on its future deal, so I\u2019m not sure who in their right mind would redeem at this point\u2026but assuming you choose not to redeem your shares, you\u2019ll also get a tradeable share of SPAR. This is effectively a 5-year LEAP call option under the name Pershing Square SPARC Holdings, Ltd. A lot of people are considering this to be a meaningless \u201cthrow-in\u201d to this deal, but this might well be the most important and valuable part of the deal. Think of a typical SPAC. On most SPACs you buy into the shell without knowing what you\u2019re really going to be investing in, and you\u2019re just blindly putting faith in a team while you\u2019re running the risk of an undesirable merger and could be losing opportunity cost for your money. Think how many SPACs trade at or near NAV for months with no appreciation. Nearly all of them.\n\n\nSPARC is going to give you the Nostradamus-like power of precognition. What if this SPARC lands a percent ownership of a mammoth company like Bloomberg, LEGO, Stripe, or Subway Restaurants? Suddenly you\u2019re Dr. Strange and you can use the time stone to decide if you want to participate in a SPAC at the NAV of $20 AFTER the definitive agreement is signed. This is LITERALLY precognition, arguably the strongest superpower. If you don\u2019t like the deal, then you can simply walk away and you have no obligation to buy into the future deal. Also, similar to the tontine warrants, SPAR holders who choose to exercise after that future DA will hold the rights to exercise a proportionately greater number of SPARs as other holders choose to drop out. As with earlier, it\u2019s a greater piece of the pie if you follow through with this.\n\n\n**THE DEAL: TONTINE WARRANTS**\n\n\nOh yeah! Forgot about those tontine warrants. What happens to them through this? Warrants are NOT going to be exchangeable for shares of UMG directly since there\u2019s no 1:1 value. Instead, they\u2019re going to be exchangeable at the 1/9th and 1/3rd ratios explained earlier, depending on redemption or not, for shares of PSTH. The value is going to be determined by taking a volume-weighted average of the PSTH Class A common stock during the 10 trading days prior to the deal. Again, this indicates it\u2019s going to be clearly better NOT to redeem because it sounds like you\u2019re going to have access to additional shares of PSTH through these warrants, which is going to yield even more shares of UMG, Remainco, and the SPARC in the end. \n\n\n**THE DEAL: POOR EXCUSE FOR AN ATTEMPT AT VALUATION**\nIt\u2019s impossible to calculate the full value here, but you\u2019re effectively looking at $14.75 for the UMG shares + 30% discount on the UMG valuation + $5.25 for the Remainco shares + any future discount Billy Boy secures on that future deal + any appreciation above the $20 NAV you get on the future SPARC deal. I\u2019m no genius, but that\u2019s going to be way over $30 per share, and as of close on Friday, June 11th, PSTH is trading at $22.96. This is quite literally guaranteed money in the bank as long as you\u2019re patient.\n\n\n**(SOME OF) THE RISKS**\n\n\nWhat are the risks? There\u2019s always risks. Well, for one, the deal could fall through. Nothing is signed. If the deal falls through, our silver-haired value king is going to have to scramble to make another deal before July 2022 when PSTH dissolves, otherwise we only get the PSTH NAV returned to us. Also, there\u2019s the risk of the SEC getting off their collective ass and actually regulating something for once. Nothing like this deal has ever been done before. It has a lot of international players. Are they going to approve it? On top of all that, UMG isn\u2019t going to be traded on a US exchange. Remainco and SPARC will be, but UMG is going to be traded on the Euronext Amsterdam exchange. Seeing as the majority of PSTH shareholders are retail, this is going to be a nightmare for their brokerages to figure out. I love Webull, I\u2019m in their influencer partner program and they support my YouTube channel, but they\u2019re a younger broker with less financial leverage, and due to the complexity of this transaction I\u2019m honestly going to be sending my PSTH shares to my Fidelity account. I\u2019m going to let the big boys figure this one out.\n\n\n**FINAL THOUGHTS**\nIn closing, I\u2019ve never told anyone to buy anything and I\u2019m not a financial professional, but\u2026come on. You guys can see these numbers as clearly as I can. When you buy a share of PSTH, you\u2019re effectively giving yourself a share of a mature industry leader and access to two other mature companies in the future. PSTH becomes its own diversified index fund in a sense, you\u2019re getting access at the ground floor of public trading for all three companies at value, and we all know how safe diversification is. This is some AAA-level opportunity here with a low-risk, high-reward profile. People were scared of the complexity and annoyed Bill didn\u2019t land some tech unicorn, but he did exactly what he said he would do. He got UMG at a discount, a mature company at value. The man\u2019s the next Buffett. Change my view.\n\n\n&gt;To anyone who made it through that whole thing, thank you. I hope you enjoyed it or learned something, at least.

I may also be resented by some on the sub for my obnoxious ranting against Canoo (HCAC/GOEV), which turned out to be accurate. \n\n**The Rumor**\n\nThe most recent [rumored target](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/traveloka-said-in-talks-to-list-via-richard-li-s-bridgetown-spac) for BTWN is Traveloka, the leading SEA online travel company.  Until we get a definitive agreement between the SPAC and target, we must glean company details from various interviews. \n\n**What Is Traveloka?**\n\nTraveloka is the #1 travel site in SEA. The app has 10M+ downloads on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.traveloka.android&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US) with almost 1 million reviews and an average rating of almost 5 stars (on the App Store as well). [SensorTower data](https://sensortower.com/ios/publisher/pt-traveloka-indonesia/898244860) shows more than 200,000 downloads in the last month alone. The [company claimed](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-traveloka-funding/se-asias-biggest-travel-app-traveloka-raises-250-million-as-lockdowns-ease-idUSKCN24T0OG) more than 60 million downloads over all devices by July 2020. Although the company began as just a travel aggregator, it quickly expanded into offering its own products and service throughout Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, [and now Australia](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/329188). The company provides transportation, hotel, and experience bookings across SEA, a region that has historically been too complex for companies like Expedia (large investor in Traveloka, see below) to operate in effectively due to the fractured nature of the travel industry, multitude of languages, and local customs. \n\nTraveloka was disproportionately affected by COVID restrictions relative to other tech unicorns, seeing transaction reductions of **up to 95%** during the lockdown peak in April-May, 2020. They raised $250m in additional capital that summer to bolster the company balance sheet and expand into other sectors. But, this black swan event showed us the flexibility of the company and innovation of the leadership. They introduced live tour streaming and interactive social media auctions, as well as the Online Xperience platform where users can learn new skills and interact with other participants (noted an 8x increase in users in July, 2020). Case in point: transactions have reached 100% and 75% of pre-COVID levels in Vietnam and Thailand, respectively. They offered a huge promotion event in Indonesia called the Traveloka Epic Sale that generated a 1300% transaction increase with steep price discounts ([source for paragraph](https://kr-asia.com/traveloka-will-expand-fintech-offerings-and-geographical-coverage-in-2021-co-founder-says)).\n\nOver the past few years, Traveloka has expanded beyond just offering travel services and into fintech. [They partnered](https://kr-asia.com/indonesias-traveloka-partners-with-state-lender-bni-for-paylater-service) with Indonesian state bank BRI in Oct 2019 to launch the PayLater VISA card and partnered with the BNI state bank in Jan 2020 to support a PayLater platform service. This is essentially building a new branch for the Traveloka brand, providing Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL), credit card, and insurance (auto, travel, health) services. \n\nWhat\u2019s so special about yet another fintech operation? Traveloka is focusing not on the **un**banked, but on the **under**banked. To quote from [a great interview](https://kr-asia.com/traveloka-will-expand-fintech-offerings-and-geographical-coverage-in-2021-co-founder-says) with the co-founder in Dec 2020: \u201cIn Indonesia, bank penetration is close to 50%, while credit card penetration is around 3%. Indonesians tend to have bank accounts, yet they do not have access to financing services. Here, we aim to bridge the gap by partnering with prominent banks and leveraging our robust technology and a large customer base.\u201d\n\nThey have also recently begun expanding fintech services outside their home country of Indonesia by [partnering with Thai bank SCB](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Finance/Indonesia-s-Traveloka-to-expand-fintech-business-into-Thailand), and are [in discussions](https://skift.com/2021/02/25/traveloka-targets-vietnam-thailand-for-launching-financial-services-ahead-of-possible-ipo/) with similar partners in Vietnam.\n\nI am especially interested in the BNPL offering, which is one of the fastest growing fintech sectors. For example, Afterpay (AFTPY) recently beat expectations with 167% YOY sales growth and Affirm (AFRM) had revenue growth of 81% and 64% in 2019 and 2020, respectively. To wit, Traveloka has already facilitated [more than 6 million loans](https://skift.com/2021/02/25/traveloka-targets-vietnam-thailand-for-launching-financial-services-ahead-of-possible-ipo/) in their home country of Indonesia after just two years of BNPL operation.\n\nWith the combination of their streaming tours, online experience options, and fintech operations, Traveloka not only managed to survive the COVID pandemic, they even managed to [turn profitable](https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/traveloka-profitable-2020-229947/) in 2020. What also helped was the company\u2019s ability to run at high efficiency. In the same article linked above, a company investor stated that Traveloka was able to burn only \u201clow single-digit million USD quarterly\u201d during the crisis.\n\nIf we use COVID revenue drop numbers [from Expedia](https://www.geekwire.com/2021/expedias-2020-revenue-sinks-57-pandemic-continues-roil-travel-industry/), we can assume a revenue reduction ranging from 40-60%. [Reportedly](https://kr-asia.com/traveloka-will-expand-fintech-offerings-and-geographical-coverage-in-2021-co-founder-says), Traveloka issued \\~$100m in refunds in 2020. So, expected annual revenue for Traveloka in 2020 could have ranged from $166m-$250m, but still maintained profitability. Highly uncertain estimates, but it\u2019s the best I can do for now.\n\n**Company Founders and Funding:**\n\n* **Founded** in 2012 by Ferry Unardi (CEO), Derianto Kusuma (ex-CTO, left co.), and Albert Zhang.\n* **Ferry Unardi background**: B.S. Computer Science &amp; Engineering at Purdue, worked as software engineer at Microsoft for 3 years, 1 semester at Harvard Business School. Dropped out of MBA program when he realized how difficult and complex it was to book travel back to his hometown of Padang, Indonesia and decided to start Traveloka at [23 years old](https://www.prestigeonline.com/id/people-events/ferry-unardi-dropped-harvard-create-traveloka/).\n* **Derianto Kusuma background:** B.S. Computer Science at Stanford, software engineer at LinkedIn and Microsoft. Pivotal in engineering the tech architecture of the company. Resigned from Traveloka in 2018 [saying](https://medium.com/@derianto/departure-from-traveloka-and-starting-a-new-chapter-91676b712805), \u201cWith the full support of my co-founders and investors, after a long negotiation process finally we agreed in all aspects on my clean break from Traveloka, and the end of 2018 turns out to be the perfect time for this.\u201d\n* First funding round in 2012 (undisclosed) from East Ventures (Indo early stage inv fund)\n* Series A funding in 2013 (undisclosed) from: Global Founders Capital (VC arm of tech incubator Rocket Internet)\n* Series B (undisclosed) from: East Ventures, Hillhouse, Sequioa, JD.com. ([source](https://www.techinasia.com/traveloka-raises-350m-from-expedia), [source](https://www.prestigeonline.com/id/people-events/ferry-unardi-dropped-harvard-create-traveloka/)).\n* Series C round in 2017 ($500m) from: Expedia, East Ventures, Hillhouse, JD.com, and Sequioa Capital (officially hitting unicorn status). $350m of that alone was from Expedia. (see sources in previous point).\n* Additional round in 2019 ($420m) from GIC (Singapore state wealth fund), valuing Traveloka at \\~$3.3b. ([source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-07/traveloka-is-said-near-fundraising-at-sharply-lower-valuation), [source](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/traveloka/company_financials)).\n* Additional round in July 2020 ($250m): This was a rare unicorn *down-round*, with valuation reducing from $3.3b to $2.75b due to company hardship related to COVID. ([source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-07/traveloka-is-said-near-fundraising-at-sharply-lower-valuation), [source](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/traveloka/company_financials)).\n\n**My Thesis:** \n\nHow will the market react to Traveloka?  I expect **very** favorably because Traveloka is a combination of growth, value, and re-opening. **GROWTH** because the company is expanding rapidly across SEA and likely yields high percent revenue growth, **VALUE** because the company is profitable in a large and growing TAM, and **RE-OPENING** because travel was clobbered by COVID and everyone is scrambling to move around again. Traveloka is NOT one of the (seemingly endless) unknown companies taking advantage of market liquidity for the founders/investors to cash out or prop up some dev-stage tech shop. Traveloka has [long been recognized](https://thelowdown.momentum.asia/how-many-unicorns-are-there-in-southeast-asia%EF%BC%9F/) as one of the best unicorns in SEA, operational for almost a decade, and backed by some of the best known VC names.\n\nSEA is a very exciting market right now, but *especially* in terms of SPACs. There are approximately [500 unicorns](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Startups/Unicorns-surge-to-500-in-number-as-US-and-China-account-for-70) (private companies valued &gt; $1b) in the world as of Nov 2020. Almost half of those (242) are in the US, followed by China (119), India (24), UK (24), and South Korea (11). Just 5 are based in Indonesia, and SEA as a whole boasts [just 9 private unicorns](https://i0.wp.com/thelowdown.momentum.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/%E5%BE%AE%E4%BF%A1%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%87_20200529023712.png?resize=696%2C365&amp;ssl=1) (link is a bit out of date). Examples are Grab (AGC), GoTo (Gojek/Tokopedia merged privately), Lazada (struggling, overtaken in GMV by SE\u2019s Shopee), Traveloka ([that\u2019s us!](https://media2.giphy.com/media/KDVswimTNahWzcd7sV/giphy.gif)), Bukalapek, and Zilingo. The point of this is that the SPAC market is WAY oversaturated with many obscure companies going public at steep valuations despite meager revenue and growth. SEA, conversely, is extremely undersaturated.\n\nHere is the list of SEA SPAC mergers: \n\n* Grab is [merging](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Biggest+SPAC+Deal+Ever%3A+Grab+To+Go+Public+in+a+%2440+Billion+Merger+With+Altimeter+%28AGC%29%2C+Backed+by+Fidelity+and+BlackRock/18252682.html) with AGC.\n* Tiket (smaller competitor to Traveloka) is [rumored](https://investor.id/market-and-corporate/cova-acquisition-negosiasi-dengan-unicorn-di-indonesia) to be in talks with COVA.\n* Tokopedia was [originally rumored](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-15/thiel-backed-spac-said-to-weigh-up-to-10-billion-tokopedia-deal) to be merging with BTWN, but has since [merged privately](https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/gojek-and-tokopedia-merge-to-form-goto-group/) with Gojek and is now [weighing public listing options](https://www.techinasia.com/gojek-tokopedias-merged-entity-goto-plans-preipo-fundraise). *Could* still go with BTWN, but I think direct listing is possible now.\n* MNC Play is [merging](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001807594/000121390021016795/ea138123ex99-1_malacca.htm) with MLAC (btw, quick shill: MLAC is way, way overlooked - I hold a bunch of warrants).\n\nThat\u2019s it. Despite the region having 360 million internet users (see below), there are few unicorn targets and SPACs relative to the United States. SEA is ripe for the SPACening. Here are some highlights regarding the region, taken from the [BTWN S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001815086/000121390020044067/fs12020_bridgetown.htm%5d:):\n\n* \u201cWhile we may pursue an acquisition or a business combination target in any business or industry, we focus our search on a target with operations or prospective operations in the technology, financial services, or media sectors, which we refer to as the \u201cnew economy sectors\u201d, in Southeast Asia.\u201d\n* \u201c\\[SEA\\] is fast becoming a major regional economic force and a driver of global growth.\u201d\n* \u201c\\[SEA\\] remains one of the fastest growing regions in the world with economic growth averaging 5.4% per annum\u201d\n* \u201c\\[SEA\\] is estimated to become the fourth-largest economy in the world by 2030 after the US, China, and the EU.\u201d\n* \u201cCollective findings by Google, Temasek, and Bain &amp; Company indicate that the region\u2019s internet economy has crossed the $100 billion mark in 2019 and is poised to triple to an estimated $300 billion by 2025.\u201d\n* \u201cWith approximately 360 million Internet users in the region, 90% of which connect to the Internet primarily through their mobile phones, Southeast Asia boasts one of the most engaged mobile internet audience in the world.\u201d\n\nIn a word:  **BULLISH**.\n\n**The SPAC: Bridgetown I (BTWN)**\n\nFounded as a co-venture between Thiel Capital (Peter Thiel) and Pacific Century (Richard Li), focused on tech, fintech, or media in Southeast Asia (SEA). [The sponsor team](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001815086/000121390020044067/fs12020_bridgetown.htm%5d:):\n\n* The primary name in BTWN is **Peter Thiel**, one of the most renowned tech investors of the 21st century. Peter Thiels first big win was cofounding Paypal with Elon Musk, then later being the first outside investor in Facebook by providing $500k in return for a 10% stake in the company in 2004. He sold most of his shares between 2012-2017 for  \\~$1.1 billion, representing a return of 220,000%. Side note: if he had never sold any of his \\~37.76m shares, his equity in FB today would be \\~$12.4b, an eye-popping return of 2,480,000%... if he had held. Other *other* side note, these are rookie numbers in comparison to Jeff Bezos and his family. Their initial investment of \\~$300k into AMZN back in 1994-1995 (later supplemented by a few dozen angel investors), would provide a return of \\~55,500,000% over 27 years. But, I digress. Other early investments by Peter Thiel (just listing off his [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel)): ABNB, LinkedIn, Yelp, SPOT, SpaceX, PLTR, ASAN, and Stripe, among others. To put it mildly: The guy\u2019s a legend.\n* Another primary name here is **Richard Li**, billionaire founder of Pacific Century, founder of Star TV (Asia\u2019s first satellite-delivered cable-TV, later sold to Murdoch\u2019s News Corp). Li\u2019s Pacific Century invests heavily in media and telecom, including companies such as Viu (video streaming), HKT (telecom), and Legendary Pictures. Other investments range from Tensar (soil solutions) to Sodecia North America (engineered materials) to FWD (insurance). One of Li\u2019s most notable investments is being among the earliest investors in the Chinese conglomerate Tencent (now $600b market cap). Various other names include Sohu (media/gaming), Chegg (ed-tech), and Tokopedia (e-commerce). \n* CEO/CFO/Director: **Daniel Wong**, senior VP of Pacific Century Group. Representing PCG and Richard Li.\n* Chairman of the board: **Matt Danzeisen**, Head of Private Investments at Thiel Capital. Representing Thiel Capital and Peter Thiel.\n* Member of the board: **Samuel Altman**, the CEO of OpenAI and former President of Y Combinator. Altman has invested in many behemoth tech companies, including AirBnb, Stripe, Reddit, Asana, and Pinterest. He [joined the board of Expedia](https://www.geekwire.com/2019/sam-altman-joins-expedia-group-board-bringing-expertise-openai-ceo-former-y-combinator-president/), one of the primary investors in Traveloka, in 2019.\n* Other board members: **John R. \u201cJay\u201d Hass**, **Joon Hwang**.\n* Senior advisor: **Kenneth Ng**.\n\n**What Is the Investment Move?**\n\nThere are three choices for investing in this SPAC: (1) BTWN shares, (2) BTWN warrants (BTWNW), or (3) BTWN options.\n\nOf the three, I think that warrants are the least desirable choice. As of this writing, they are trading at $1.95, which is a somewhat steep premium to pay in the current SPAC market environment.\n\nThe second-best option is BTWN shares - they are trading just 10 cents over NAV at $10.10, so they offer good downside protection at the cost of more limited upside. I have a sizable position in BTWN shares.\n\nThe best choice, in my opinion, is BTWN call options. Each options contract gives you leverage over 100 shares. Because the implied volatility (IV) on SPACs is so low right now, premiums are cheap. With BTWN July $10c trading at $0.30 ($30/contract), the break-even price on each contract is just 1.98% above the current share price. This means that you are getting leverage of 33:1 (depending on the contract price). As with all options trades, liquidity is incredibly important. In the case of the July calls, open interest (the number of active contracts) is **26,281** as of this writing.\n\nIn my opinion, these **July options offer one of the greatest reward/risk ratios in the market right now**. For every $1 move up in share price above $10, each contract gains an intrinsic value of $100. That means the percent return at expiration on each contract is:\n\n* 100% at price of $10.60\n* 233% at price of $11.00\n* 567% at price of $12.00\n* 900% at price of $13.00\n* 1233% at price of $14.00\n\nSo to provide an example from [optionsprofitcalculator.com](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/), purchasing 50 July $10c options contracts for $30 each ($0.30/share) at a total of $1,500 could generate the following $ returns: [http://opcalc.com/vql](http://opcalc.com/vql). Pretty astounding!\n\nNot to mention that option contract prices are also dictated by volatility. If the underlying stock were to become more volatile, options contract premiums will (up to a certain share price, that is, bc we\u2019re buying ITM options).\n\n**Why Are Options Premiums So Low?**\n\nWell, because pops on SPAC DA announcements are, to say the least, muted right now. The growth market has gotten hammered since March, with many stocks down 30-60% from ATHs. SPACs were disproportionately affected because they are among the most speculative investment in the growth market and investors have been reluctant to jump back in. At its low, the SPAK ETF was down **37% from ATH**. But over the last couple weeks, the market has begun to rebound. For example, 5 days ago SPAK [broke out](https://share.trendspider.com/chart/SPAK/28503eb61b8) of its month\u2019s long downtrend with the RSI surpassing 50. Many pre-merger and deSPAC names have begun to trend upward with 5d and 7d EMAs crossing over the 20d EMA, including [SKLZ](https://share.trendspider.com/chart/SKLZ/28503ebgcma) (my baby), [BFLY](https://share.trendspider.com/chart/BFLY/28503ebhyy6), [SOFI](https://share.trendspider.com/chart/SOFI/28503ebjbl5), and [ACTC](https://share.trendspider.com/chart/ACTC/28503ebl7td).\n\nThe low premiums on these options are why I think this is a great play right now. As Warren Buffet said, \u201cBe greedy when others are fearful\u201d (though I\u2019m **sure** he wasn\u2019t referring to options). My position in shares is just a cash reserve right now with potential upside (I discussed that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/kbgtd6/why_this_is_a_onceinadecade_or_more_spac_bonanza/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) a bit), but the options appear to have incredibly high upside by providing leverage. With my 200 ITM options, I am gaining leverage over 20,000 shares, equivalent to a $200,000 position, for a price of just $6,000 (albeit with a strict time constraint).\n\n**Why This SPAC?**\n\nThere are [hundreds of active SPACs](https://spactrack.net/activespacs/) right now actively searching or rumored to be in talks with a target. Buying contracts on any of the optionable ones that don\u2019t have credible rumors is a big risk. Case in point: I did just that with XPOA options as a cheap gamble and am now down 40% on them because they\u2019re merging with a relatively boring mobile gaming company. *Note: I think the company is good, but not exactly exciting for the rest of the market, unfortunately*.\n\nBTWN is a unique case, however. The management team is composed of some of the best investors in the world (Thiel, Li) and they have a credible rumor (Bloomberg) targeting a long-established unicorn (Traveloka) in one of the hottest marketplaces in the world (SEA). As a comparison, the SPAC AGC (planning to merge with SEA\u2019s Grab) is trading at 19% over NAV. **At that price, the intrinsic value of BTWN July calls would represent a return of 533%** (assuming a purchase price of $30/contract). The AGC merger values Grab at around $40b, approximately 8-9x that of the rumored BTWN/Traveloka merger. Because the valuation of Traveloka is so much smaller, it can have much higher volatility during price discovery.\n\nYou could always try the October calls, but the premium is 100% higher and open interest is just 28% of the July calls. If we haven\u2019t gotten a DA announcement in the next couple weeks, you could just roll the contracts to the October strike for a minimal loss.\n\nSide note: I recently DMed the author of the Bloomberg article, Yoolim Lee, on Twitter to check in on the rumor itself. She confirmed that (1) no, there haven\u2019t been recent rumor updates, and (1) yes, the rumor is for BTWN, not BTNB.\n\n**How To Size Your Options Position**\n\n**DO NOT YOLO** these options. In fact, never YOLO on anything, let alone options (well, SPAC shares are safe pre-merger). We invest in SPACs because of the floor price built into pre-merger commons. Options on these shares are inherently high risk, but in the current market environment this is even more so the case. My call options represent just a small percentage of my portfolio because they can absolutely go to zero if the share price is under $10 by July 16 or can easily lose 50% of their value. The person or MM writing/selling these options is, in fact, betting on that scenario. Personally, **I keep options purchases at or under 1% of my portfolio**. Let me reiterate: DO. NOT. YOLO. If you get the urge to, just buy a small percentage in options, then put the rest into BTWN shares since they are protected by the NAV.\n\n**Disclosure:**\n\nThis is not financial advice. I\u2019m just a random guy on the internet. Assume the worst about me and do your own research!\n\n**My Positions:**\n\n* 9,000 BTWN shares - subject to change, probably moving into PACX because it is *wayyyy* overlooked and undervalued.\n* 200 July 16 $10c options",

        "selftext": "As a sequel to \"10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM\", I'm back with 10 more ETFs that have less than $1b AUM but that I think are interesting and possibly useful and some comments on each.  Too often only the biggest ETFs, or most popular, get people's attention. I think it's worth looking further to see what's out there.\n\nStarting with a Peter Lynch inspired strategy (Lynch popularized the price/earnings-to-growth ratio),\n\n1. SPGP: Invesco S&amp;P 500 GARP ETF, [https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=SPGP](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=SPGP) . \"Growth at a Reasonable Price\" (GARP).  This ETF is an interesting combination factor screener.  It only selects from S&amp;P 500 stocks, and screens them first for 3-year earnings and sales growth, and second for financial leverage (debt), return on equity, and earnings yield (trailing-twelve-month or \"TTM\" net income / market cap).  Holdings are weighted by growth score, not market cap.  GARP's historical performance is surprisingly good; it beat the S&amp;P 500 since January 2020 and beats both the S&amp;P and traditional CRSP growth/value factors YTD.  It also outperforms the S&amp;P on some longer timeframes.  Index rebalanced semiannually (3rd Friday June/Dec), and it costs a moderate 0.34% ER.  It's designed to hold 75 stocks.  Check SPGP out when it rebalances later in the month!\n\nMoving on to Factor ETFs,\n\n2.  FVAL: Fidelity Value Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL) .  This ETF tracks and index that calculates scores for: free cash flow yield, EBITDA to enterprise value, book value to price, and forward earnings to price. The first two factors result in it having some tech giants such as FB, GOOGL, AMZN, and AAPL in the index. But not some others, such as TSLA, which scores very poorly on... well, every factor. Banks are just scored on book to price and forward earnings to price, as their business model is not comparable to most other stocks. FVAL provides an interesting way to get exposure to possibly-not-overpriced intellectual property-heavy companies, as well as traditional value stocks.  Currently holds about 130 stocks.\n\n3.  FIVA: Fidelity International Value Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FIVA](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FIVA) .  The international (mostly developed markets) counterpart to FVAL, this ETF fills a great niche since forward-looking international value ETFs are few and far between.  Most value ETFs are heavy on book value, and rely on backward looking metrics or ignore free cash flow.  FIVA (and FVAL) take a different approach.  Currently holds about 120 stocks.  FIVA is perhaps the single most overlooked ETF in this entire list -- it provides a unique type of international exposure, and at only 0.39% ER. International factor funds often have slightly higher ERs than total market funds, but may provide much greater total return given desirable macro-economic conditions.  For example, since the first vaccine was proven effective (which kicked off the value rally), FIVA has outperformed VEA by about 6 percent.\n\n4.  JVAL: JPMorgan U.S. Value Factor ETF, [https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-value-factor-etf-46641q753](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-value-factor-etf-46641q753) .  JVAL's index is also a value screen. It scores via four metrics: earnings yield, book to price, free cash flow yield, and TTM dividend yield. Pretty well-rounded in that it includes earnings, book, and yield measures. It does not include forward earnings metrics. Due to the cash flow and earnings metrics, it ends up including some big tech companies like FB, GOOGL, and MSFT. While it includes a dividend metric, the JVAL ETF has a lower 30-day SEC yield than VTV or dividend-focused ETFs such as SCHD, so I would not consider it as a dividend fund.  Holds about 350 stocks.  \n\n5. FQAL: Fidelity Quality Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=fqal](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=fqal) .  Quality ETFs depart from value ETFs in that they're less concerned about price/earnings metrics.   Fidelity's offering in the space weights stocks on free cash flow margin, return on invested capital (one of Charlie Munger's favorite metrics), and free cash flow stability.  For banks, it looks at return on equity and debt to assets.  This ends up having a lot of overlap with the S&amp;P 500, but it ends up filtering out companies like TSLA and as per its goal, only has about 130 companies overall.  Like FVAL, this costs 0.29% ER.  Fairly common for US factor funds.\n\n6. JQUA: JPMorgan U.S. Quality Factor ETF, [https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761) .  JPMorgan handles \"quality\" a bit differently.  They have 10, yes ten, different metrics that go into measuring quality.  They're grouped into categories for \"profitability\", \"solvency and financial risk\", and \"earnings quality\".  Loosely stated, they're looking for companies making reliable cold hard cash hand over fist that are not too indebted.  Like the Fidelity offering, it ends up looking a lot like the S&amp;P 500 but with slightly different weights.  GOOGL currently sits at the top of its holdings.\n\nLet us not forget commodities,\n\n7. COM: Direxion Auspice Broad Commodity Strategy ETF, [https://www.direxion.com/product/auspice-broad-commodity-strategy-etf](https://www.direxion.com/product/auspice-broad-commodity-strategy-etf) .  A fascinating ETF, it covers 12 different commodity futures in categories for metals, agriculture, and energy.  Different from most other commodity ETFs, it's almost like a commodity trend advisor (CTA) fund because it can take both long and \"flat\" (neutral/no) position in each commodity.  This helped COM wonderfully during the commodity crash in 2Q20 because they were able to go flat and preserve value, avoiding the oil crash.  If inflation comes back big time, commodities will benefit.  And if a commodity bubble bursts, this fund may be able to avoid some of the downside.  No K-1 form.  Might be my go-to outside of GUNR (equity ETF) for commodity exposure.\n\n8. CMDY: iShares Bloomberg Roll Select Commodity Strategy ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/292741/ishares-bloomberg-roll-select-commodity-strategy-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/292741/ishares-bloomberg-roll-select-commodity-strategy-etf-fund) .  A somewhat newer offering from Blackrock, this broad commodity fund systematically positions itself to best handle carry cost in the futures curve (and thus adjusts for contango / backwardation curves).  It has generally outperformed other popular long-only commodity funds, and avoid being overweight on oil/energy futures.\n\nSeeking dividends?\n\n9. SCHY: Schwab International Dividend Equity ETF, [https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schy](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schy) . A new offering from Schwab, it's the international counterpart to SCHD.  Its index filters for companies that have made 10 consecutive years of dividend payments, and ranks them by cash flow to total debt, return on equity, dividend yield, and 5-year dividend growth rate.  After a volatility screen, the results are weighted by a capped market capitalization approach.  A wonderful mirror to SCHD for those seeking reliable income, but who also want to diversify outside of US markets.  I predict its AUM will go up by 10x in less than 2 years.  Also quite inexpensive at 0.14% ER -- Schwab is likely subsidizing this, in order to help it grow.\n\nFinally, like it or not, blockchain is here to stay,\n\n10. BLOK: Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF, [https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html](https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html) .  The AUM of this ETF is right around the $1b mark, but I'm including it anyway.  It seems to be the best-of-breed actively managed ETF for exposure to stocks benefiting from bitcoin mania and blockchain tech.  Clearly, it's volatile.  And it's not a pure bitcoin/ethereum play -- some small amounts of Samsung, IBM, and so on sneak in due to them having a connection to the space.  But it does hit all the big names, including recently listed Coinbase ($COIN).  If you can't be bothered to follow or deal with crypto in general but want something that will remain correlated to it, this is the ETF.  Pricey at 0.71% ER, but, it's actively managed and still has a lower ER than ARK's funds.\n\nDisclaimers: this is not financial advice. I currently have a position in FVAL, but no position in any of the other ETFs at time of posting.  That may change at any point in the future.  I am not predicting future performance for any of these funds.  Do your own due diligence (and please post in reply with what you find!).\n\nWhat do you guys think? Any of those look like something you might invest in? Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund?",

        "selftext": " ***Gather round the campfire kiddo's - let me tell you about Good Ole' Grandape Foley.***\n\nMany know the merits of Grandape Foley, but lots of you young monkey-like, natural resource handed savages may not. So let me paint the picture for you.\n\nYou think you have hands of Diamond? Well let me tell you.. Grandape Foley has diamond hands of the highest kind. Carats so large he doesn't only drag his knuckles, his forearms scrape the floor too. Here are some fun facts about Grandape Foley that will explain the legend behind the Ape.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* He's 76 years old and still kicking wall street bankers in the dick. He does things his own way and builds empires with his glorious diamond hands mostly from scratch. I'll touch on that below.  \n \n* He was born\u00a0**4**\u00a0months and\u00a0**16**\u00a0days before Hitler died. 4 days short of a 420. Coincidence? I think not.  \n \n* As a young ape he lived in Texas, papa and mama ape Foley were ranchers (simple folks trying to make a living). He didn't have a silver spoon in his mouth and he built everything he has from scratch. He played something called\u00a0[Shinny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinny)\u00a0which is like informal Ice Hockey. He used a fuckin' broomstick on thin ice to play hockey. Everyone should hail Grandape Foley for his large balls and come up from nothing.  \n \n* In 1967, while still in school...He made $40,000 in the stock market in his spare time.\u00a0***In 1960 fucking 7***. That's the equivalent of $322,000 today. He made the equivalent of more than a quarter of a million (in his spare time) before your daddy and mommy were out of grade school. Did I mention he wound up losing it all. Sounds like\u00a0***one of us.*** *(One of us! One of us!)*  \n \n* He went to the Air Force and left after getting bored of negotiating multi-million dollar defense deals with Boeing. Grandape Foley had other goals in mind. So, he took his diamond hands and diamond balls and got into business...  \n \n* Foley got involved with Fidelity National. Back when they were\u00a0*only*\u00a0doing $6m a year in revenue and grew the fuckin' thing to a current\u00a0**$90B**\u00a0market cap. Let that sink it. Diamond hands if I've ever seen any.  \n \n\n**Grandape Foley is building his legacy, from scratch, everything he touches turns to gold with those glorious diamond hands. Fast-forward a bit and here's what he does next:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Remember when I told you he played Shinny (informal ice hockey w/ a fucking broomstick). Well he developed a lifelong passion for Ice Hockey. So what does a rich, self-made ape do with his money and passion for Ice Hockey? Well, he buys an NHL team of course.But this isn't just any old regular ape schmo we're talkin' about here. This is Grandape Foley. He doesn't just buy the best team in hockey and take over the league. That would be too easy. Nope, he\u00a0***starts a new team, from scratch.***  \n \n* In 2017 Grandape Foley brings the Las Vegas Golden Knights into the NHL and in their 2nd year they're already in the finals for the Stanley Cup. They didn't win, but that's likely because Foley wasn't on the ice with his broomstick.  \n \n\n***And now the most important part in the legend of Grandape Foley.***\n\nAll the while, he's been building an almost silent iGaming Empire. And if there is anything we can learn from all of this, it's that Grandape Foley\u00a0***is a winner!***\n\nHe took PaySafe (PSFE) public around 6 months ago to not much fan fare. But Grandape Foley doesn't give a fuck. He's been silently moving his big balls all-through the iGaming industry making large strategic moves.\n\nGrandape Foley once said it was hard to handle poker chips in his hometown of Vegas because they fall out of his diamond hands. So he's envisioning an entirely chipless casino industry, in person and legally online. While everyone is focusing on digital coins and old outdated movie companies getting eaten alive by Netflix. Foley is building a new world in iGaming and doing it on the back of PSFE.\n\nHere's some more DD on Grandape Foley incase you haven't heard:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* [He invested $100M in a 'strategic' move in sightline payments.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWoEz9BeqGQ)\u00a0Which is bringing cashless payments to casinos. Strategic typically means, 'we intend on acquiring you'.  \n \n* [he is bringing Wynn Casinos public.](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/05/11/wynn-resorts-online-gambling-platform-is-going-pub/)\u00a0Synergy baby! not to mention the ticker symbol... AUS, autists... he's speaking to us.  \n \n* PSFE is currently landing deal after deal with iGaming providers to be their payments platform.  \n \n\nThis is a huge industry almost none of the big providers are touching because of the legal red-tape on iGaming and supporting their payment flow. So quietly, Grandape Foley is building an empire through PSFE.\n\nA couple of thought provoking questions to think on in your Monkey brains:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Isn't it obvious what's going on here? Foley is using the underlying payments platform PSFE to leverage his relationships in Vegas to completely dominate the iGaming industry.  \n \n2. Good ole' Grandape owns an NHL team in Vegas. You better believe these Casino CEOs are coming to his owners box and talking business deals.  \n \n3. Strategically investing in Sightline (cashless casinos tech) and Wynn (a large casino in and around Vegas)... hmmm...  \n \n\n**Finally and most importantly what caused me to YOLO hard into PSFE**\n\nFrom one Diamond handed ape to another, ask yourself... Why would Foley who is 76 years old, has all the money in the world and owns a major winning sports franchise waste his time messing around with PSFE and all the strategic plays if he didn't think this was going to be his biggest deal yet, and maybe\u00a0***his life legacy?***\n\nI believe it will be. I believe he knows exactly what he's doing. You don't go from playing 'Shinny' with a broomstick on thin ice and milking cows to becoming a multi-self-made-billionaire if you don't know what you're doing.\n\nI'm betting on good ole' Grandape Foley.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bo6nxqbe6g771.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1386c8d3dab6554b272c60211a253c83e287aa3",

        "selftext": "Now could be a good time to buy $RIDE. \n\nIt\u2019s got institutions like Vanguard that bought over 20m shares since the DPHC/RIDE merger in October of 2020. Vanguard &gt; Ark. Not only are we talking about this old guard with over $6.2 trillion in assets, a whole hosts of others: \n\nBlackRock; Invesco; Fidelity; Charles Schwab; JP Morgan; Wells Fargo; Susquehanna; Goldman Sachs\u2026.\nD) All of the above \n\nInstitutions, smart money, are anticipating Lordstown Motors to start production of their all electric pickup truck, the Endurance, this September. Followed up by mass production of the world\u2019s first commercial electric light duty trucks in 2022. It\u2019s not just an EV - it\u2019s American history! Trucks are the #1 selling vehicles in America. We love our trucks!\n\nIf you want to talk a little about technical chart analysis:\n\nIn April the MACD and Stochastic suggested strong support. The blue line crossed over the bollinger bands or something\u2026golden crossed at about $12. $12 right before tanking and falling off a financial cliff, AGAIN?!, to $7 this time. So $RIDE goes from all time highs of about $31 to just $7 in less than 3 months. 3 months?! There was a huge pullback in everything EV. Then, there was that short report by no other than Hindenburg Research in March. I hate collusions like, $25 baggage fees from every single commercial airlines. All of them, all of a sudden?! REALLY?! With a passion and every ounce of breath and beat of my heart, I hate everything that is unjust. If Hindenburg Research wasn\u2019t enough, Wolfe Research downgrades $RIDE to $1. They obviously have more money than me but who the hell is Wolfe Research?! ONE DOLLAR?!?!! Never heard of them till they tried to \u2018Karen\u2019 Lordstown Motors. Like I said, HATE everything that is unjust. Back to business. \n\nIt\u2019s been way over sold and way abused by short interests. $RIDE was attacked with 30% short interest on two separate occasions, March and May. It\u2019s hard to be glass is half full when you got glass is half empty people, hedge funds doing glass is half empty sh\u2026.?! Back to business. $RIDE has massive potential to the upside. The market capital on $RIDE is almost criminal - $1.1b?! Their 6.2m square feet assembly plant with state of the art expensive gm (General Mototrs) robots probably $2-3b by itself. Plus, the fact that Lordstown Motors is ready for manufacturing! It\u2019s a country mile closer to manufacturing than $NKLA, $FSR, $GOEV and Rivian. But that the whole mkt. cap thing?? Lordstown Motors has manufactured the 57 betas, already test driven and crash tested. Good standing, for the record. Those 57 betas were in the Hindenburg Research short report, questioning whether or not Lordstown Motors could get it done\u2026.bs never ends! As I mentioned earlier, $RIDE has been beaten down heavily, -66% from its highs back in mid-February. A lot of it was unjust, I think. Think of this as a business opportunity or an opportunity to make a boat load of money. \n\nInstitutions are smart, they know already, and put their assets where the winners are. $RIDE is definitely that!",

Basically, we are limited to E-Trade or Fidelity or similarly other old and gravy trading platforms.\n\nSo this raises my question - how come startups such as Robinhood and WeBull support cryptocurrency but well established old trading platforms such as E-Trade and Fidelity don't?

        "selftext": "Let me preface this by saying that I\u2019m a doctor and I use this app every day. Also, I have bought 250 shares pre-ipo due to using app and having a fidelity account, special pre-ipo they offered healthcare workers. \n\nToday is the IPO of Doximity. It is an app (saas) that is a mix between telehealth and a social media platform for doctors, nurse practitioners, PAs, dentists, etc. They are one of a kind in that they\u2019re the only ones with this scope in the industry having the social media platform plus telehealth all in one. 80% (me included) of all doctors in the US use doximity. They also allow you to find jobs in your field and keep you up to date on the latest research. It is going to debut for 26$ and boy is that a deal. \n\nThis business has a market cap around 4 bil and is the market leader in an industry (telehealth, social media for professionals) that is about to drip like the oil boom. According to their S1, this industry is worth ~18 bil and is growing rapidly. That is telehealth. That does not include all the other aspects of this business. Last year alone over 63 million telehealth visits occurred. There are so many implications for this service (seeing patients unable to make it to clinic, counseling, etc). This is just the tip of the ice berg. With the money from the ipo they plan to grow rapidly and may incorporate an electronic medical records with this service eventually, which is fucking huge. It would make my life so much easier lol. \n\nWithin the last year revenue grew 78% from 116.4 mil to 206 mil. They also are already positive with earnings. Their biggest competitor, tdoc, (look at what they ipo at and now) are not profitable. This company is about to fucking boom don\u2019t miss out.

        "selftext": "I see many posts across Reddit seeking advice/knowledge on how to get started investing. Investing can appear scary and complicated! The truth is that it is really quite simple, but requires discipline and resolve. It also requires that you make a plan, understand your plan, and sick to it with faithfulness. Be confident that you do not need to pay somebody else to do your investing for you!\n\nYou don't need to question yourself, you don't need to panic, and you don't need to spend a single second looking at prices. All you need to do is stay the course. \n\nI created this post to provide guidance and distill my research into a digestible and actionable path for newcomers who feel intimidated and confused. If you take the time to read this post and put it in to practice, it can almost be guaranteed that in the long term you will outperform the average investor and even the average professional investor as well. It requires zero understanding of the stock market. Sounds too good to be true, but consider this fact: Fidelity found that the demographic of investors with the best performance were dead people, the second best group of performers were investors who forget about their accounts. Clearly, fancy strategies don't translate to fancy returns, so sit back, relax, and approach this advice with an open mind. \n\nHere it is:\n\nInvesting requires you to answer two basic questions:\n1) What is my time horizon? \nIn other words, when will I need to withdraw the money?\n2) What is my risk tolerance?\nIn other words, will I get frazzled and lose sleep if stock prices drop 50%?\n\nOnce you have answered these two basic questions, you can determine your personal asset allocation and begin saving. Then you will know what percentage should be invested in stocks and what percentage should be invested in bonds. The reason this is important is because it prevents you from selling your stocks at a loss. If you're going to sell at a loss, you would be better off not buying stocks in the first place.\n\nOnce you know the percentage going towards stocks, you can then decide which stocks to buy. If you have no clue what to buy, then you can't go wrong buying the entire stock market. VTSAX allows you to buy the entire US stock market with rock bottom fees. It is administered by Vanguard. They are my brokerage of choice because Vanguard is owned by the investors who purchase their funds; they don't answer to outside shareholders. However, other brokerages will do. You can purchase BND to buy the entire bond market or simply find another bond fund to your liking.\n\nOnce you have purchased your investments, the next step is to not look at them and let them grow. This is the most difficult step and where most investors fail. You may want to rebalance occasionally however. If you're initial percentages shift out of alignment, you can buy and sell to reestablish your initial percentages. Or you don't have to do that at all! Most importantly, don't forget that you can't sell stocks when stock prices drop (prices will drop at some point). \n\nThere are two phases of investing: wealth accumulation and wealth preservation. Retirement marks the transition. \n\nRetirement drawdown proposes slightly different considerations than retirement saving. This is the point in time that you may want to consider shifting your allocation away from stocks and more into bonds. This is because while you are living off your retirement savings, you will probably be selling every year even if the market goes down, so owning bonds provides more safety in that environment. Of course, this still depends on your personal risk tolerance. \n\nOnce you figure out your annual budget in retirement, a good rule of thumb is the four percent rule. The four percent rule states that you can withdraw four percent of your retirement savings each year for spending. In other words, you become eligible for retirement when you have saved 25 times your annual expenses. Note that this does not account for other sources of income such as pension, annuity, social security, etc. So your individual numbers may be adjusted accordingly. \n\nLastly, I pray that you may enjoy your gains and that the market may be kind to you. \n\n\"Buy right and hold tight\" -Jack Bogle\n\nCheers!",

        "selftext": "Hey guys. \n\nI posted last time about the oil environment and since then things have only gotten spicier. Here is the link to the last post. \n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n5dzl9/return_of_big_oil_the_death_of_oil_has_been/\n\nSorry to use a baseball reference but we are in the 2nd or 3rd inning of a great oil supercycle regardless of what the Kingdom of Saudi says through OPEC+. Last time I was speculating on the upside and I will continue to do so but update the current progress. I have sold some of my lower price calls ($60 and $70 and moved them to $80 calls) additionally, I have increased exposure to OXY calls.\n\nTLDR: Current Trends are now showing from Gov. agencies that we will not have enough increase to cover demand causing the price to continue to march upward. \nXOM Calls: 244 $80 calls for 1/21/22 63 $75 calls for 1/21/22 77 $70 calls for 1/21/22 6 $60 calls for 1/21/22\n\nOXY Calls: 31 $40 calls for 1/20/23\n\nOk. So here's some news. EIA reported their details yesterday and Baker Hughes put a great graph showing the number of rigs in correspondence with the oil price. One thing to note is that even with efficiencies in Rig use we will still need additional rigs to hold production flat as we see the large decline profiles on the well brought online in 2018-2019. Keep that in mind when looking at the US production. Might be time to look at Oilfield Service companies.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/chigrl/status/1405170946097483783\n\nThe expectation from WoW was for roughly a -4 million barrel draw and we doubled expectations with -7.5. One other thing  to note was that the refineries are running at extreme capacity in the US. They have yet to shut in for preventative maintenance that usually happens around this time. (92.7% utilization)\n\nhttps://www.eia.gov/petroleum/weekly/crude.php\n\nThis shows the current information on the week from the EIA on Crude Oil stocks. Clearly we are smack dab in the middle of the 5 year average however we should see draws consistently from this point on in the summer and even with significant activity we will expect that this summer oil will continue to rise. Macro wise, the Russian oil minister said that if more money is not reinvested in finding and developing oil (2020 $384 billion, normally its around $800-900 B) then the supercycle in oil will create a demand spike to prices of $150 per BBL. Take his commentary with a grain of salt. Its Russia.. That being said this new information prior to Q2 earnings from any O/G company has not been fully realized.\n\nFocusing on XOM, BOA announced that XOM will increase the dividend in Q4 and the share price should be around $90/share by the end of year while bringing the debt levels back to 20-25%. \n\nhttps://pulse2.com/xom-stock-price-increased-3-64-why-it-happened/\n\nThey are on the extreme end of pricing in terms of valuation but here is the consensus amongst analyst:\nGoldman:           $65\nMorgan Stanley: $71\nCredit Suisse:    $72\nMorning Star:    $74\nJPM:                 $76\nBOA:                $90\n\nObviously, there are some that I am missing but you get the point at the current share price of $62.27 (sell off this morning) there is some upside in the near term. My key takeaway is that the analysts expect a large earnings report next quarter and the rest of the year. The Engine 1 board takeover (25% of the board) was able to convince the largest shareholders (Blackrock, Fidelity, California School Board) that the changing of the board would help govern the spending of XOM (not really focused on the climate side) however it would show that the large money managers are trying to make an attempt at moving towards climate issues. (IMO it was all about the recent performance of the stock and a referendum on Woods performance not on climate issues.)\n\nSo, where does that leave us?\n\nXOM in the next quarters at the current Oil price of $70.73 will be able to pay off a large portion of their debt from last year, pay the dividend and potentially raise the dividend by EOY. All while the price of oil remains above $70. Not to mention the activity in Guyana in which XOM found another zone to target offshore that will produce and sell at Brent pricing $72.83. (Might also be time to look at HESS)\n\nhttps://www.naturalgasintel.com/exxonmobil-partners-strike-more-oil-in-stabroek-offshore-guyana/\n\nAll of that is on the crude side w/o the refining capacity that XOM has increased and now lets talk about natural gas. The XTO acquisition was terrible by all means but it has provided some benefit of large natural gas exposure. Henry Hub currently is at $3.24 and essentially, XOM produces the gas and ships it to Asia where it sells for 2-3x HH. Currently, the outlook is good and should remain stable with more gas going to exports until we see a larger increase in export capacity and there is a chance that with a colder winter this year, 2022 would have large swings in gas pricing. Roughly we are 4% down on the 5 year average curve but gas companies have been extremely hesitant to increase production and have contained supply.\n\nNow on to OXY. What a terrible company. Literally every time I look at the balance sheet I cry. So bad. However, they have a couple good signs that they will make it out ok. \n#1 Burry decided to pick up 225,000 shares\n#2 CNBC reported live that David Tepper thinks oxy will end the year at $40-50/share\n#3 As quoted in their IR slides, for every $1 increase from $45 in WTI Oxy will have 185MM (46.25MM per QTR) so lets play on this further and we would be around $1.1 B of FCF per QTR assuming everything is consistent. (Highly doubt its that high but whatever)\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-16/david-tepper-says-he-s-bullish-much-loathed-oil-stocks\n\nAlso, BOA had a call with OXY as the last presenter and here is the transcript\nhttps://www.oxy.com/investors/Documents/BAML%202020%20Conference%20Presentation%20Transcript.pdf\n\nThis presentation let us know that OXY plans on continuing its divestment of non-core assets while retaining a large amount of the purchased Anadarko acreage. Recently, OXY divested $508 million set of properties in Reeves which was a great price per acre and flowing barrel (10k per acre ish). I think that this will shock the investment community on their Q2 and Q3 reports when they significantly reduce debt. Their focus is to push out the maturities in 2024 and pay off almost all of the debt due in the next 2 years with FCF. This will make OXY extremely attractive at the current price.\n\nOXY is a bet on the company not being a shit company. That is why my calls are set out so far. I don't trust the management but I cannot deny the money they will make give the price of oil and the land positioning of their interests in the Permian. Let me know your thoughts about what companies you see making a killing this year and this is not financial advice just thoughts about my positions.",

        "selftext": "# DEAR APES,\n\nA few weeks ago I began posting on AMD. At the time, the stock was trading in the mid-70's.\n\nToday, as expected, we crossed $90 price... but our trip is just getting **STARTED**!\n\nThe deal with TESLA was announced, as well as the next AMAZING technologies in Computex, including the stacked cache for Zen3, Fidelity FX Super Resolution, the 6900 XTX Liquid Cooled, etc.\n\nThere's a very simple reason why AMD will go past the MOON and MARS: **ENTERTAINMENT**\n\nThe world revolves around entertainment and in this new era, this activity is mandatory to deal with Covid-19, the lack of international travel, work from home, etc.\n\nTESLA adopting AMD for its new Model X and S is HUGE. It will take a Navi23 and an APU (two chips) per car, likely becoming an optional for all other vehicles in the future. More automobile brands will follow, as TESLA is leading the way in the industry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[TESLA selected AMD chips for its upcoming vehicles](https://preview.redd.it/aekg7gm3u8871.jpg?width=2243&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c178f47df42b4159f92d1248ac9618a3f8440643)\n\nWith autonomous driving, gaming in a long trip will be mandatory. But even without it, the rest of the passengers can game, either with their fellow companions or online, from their car.\n\nSo, yes, the current automotive revolution will have AMD as a main supplier.\n\nThen you have consumer processing, which includes CPU's and GPU's, where AMD is dominating (mostly on the former). The Zen3 architecture is a MONSTER. Intel just cannot compete. And with the stacked cache providing up to 15% more gaming performance, that lead will continue on AMD's side.\n\nOn GPU's, AMD's Navi31 is expected to be MCM (multi-chip module), aiming to repeat AMD's success with Intel, but now against NVIDIA. \"Chiplets\" allow for economies of scale to thrive. More silicon, will less defects, better binning, cheaper... it is an AMAZING IDEA. Just add cache and the latency problem can be mitigated.\n\nOn the console gaming, AMD is the undisputed KING. They're in the PS4, PS4 Pro, PS5, Xbox model and series X/S. Also in the Aya Neo and expected in Valve's next handheld, which will be a MONSTER.\n\nOn Datacenter, AMD is groundbreaking. Epyc and the new offerings from **GOOGLE** for virtual machines is an INCREDIBLE deal. **AMAZON, TENCENT, ALIBABA, AZURE** (Microsoft), they are all buying chips from AMD. More CORES means MORE power processing, lower energy, lower licensing costs and certainly better SECURITY (as INTEL has been plagued by Spectre &amp; Meltdown issues). AMD is now expected to go from 64 cores in EPYC to 96... and also 128. That's just ludicrous, 128 CORES and 256 threads. And X86 clients are THRILLED to buy more power in a more efficient chip.\n\n[Google wants AMD Milan Epyc Chips for its Datacenter](https://preview.redd.it/36x8ygt6u8871.jpg?width=2284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d96e3eab884218203d9fbe906b9ba3474902e13)\n\nDeals with the US Department of Energy (El Capitan), Singapore and Germany, all for public datacenters worth millions of dollars. That's just the tip of the iceberg, as private players are taking note of EPYC.\n\nLast, **but certainly NOT least: MOBILE**\n\nAMD will power Samsung's S22 flagship phone. It's GPU is expected to break records, as engineering samples already have it beating MALI and Apple's options, by **double digits**.\n\n**Samsung** is delighted and **Google** also wants AMD chips for its phones.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Samsung wants AMD's chips for its flagship GALAXY S22](https://preview.redd.it/xu07hgobu8871.jpg?width=1919&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfea79ba818835fb83a9cb5f51d5189cf2d034e0)\n\nBut enough on the PRODUCTS. What about the fundamentals?\n\nRevenue growth is expected at 50% by the end of 2021. How many companies are growing by 50%?\n\nAnd that guidance was provided with the Q1 results in April, which were exceeding expectations. The raised the guidance from 37% to 50%... and will certainly BEAT IT.\n\nAMD is NOW a profitable company... and it literally CANNOT keep its products on shelves, as its clients are buying ALL THEIR CHIPS.\n\nAMD's valuation is $110 billion, while NVIDIA (w/slightly more revenue &amp; profit) is $500 billion.\n\nHow is NVIDIA 5 times the value of AMD???... Just because of a stock split?\n\nIt is currently trading at 38 times earnings, which if they grow by 50% in 6 months, will certainly drop.\n\nSo yeah, the stock is currently above $90 and aiming to reach its all-time high of $99 which was reached a few months ago, in January.\n\nAnalyst consensus of the stock is currently $106.54 ([https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast)) which slightly better than an 18% upside, which would take it to a mere $ 132 billion market cap.\n\nIf you ask me, AMD should be **at least HALF** of NVIDIA's $500 billion market cap.\n\nLastly, the Xilinx acquisition, which will aim to create synergies among functions (e.g. HR, Procurement, Engineering, etc.). It will also increase AMD's share of the silicon purchasing world, as TSMC will have AMD as its #2 client, only second to Apple.\n\nXilinx cancelled its dividends as its shareholders approved the merger with AMD.\n\nAMD may choose to bring dividends back after the merger... yet in the meantime, they announced a $4 Billion share buyback program. They know their stock is trading **CHEAP**.\n\n# On the positions (full disclosure): YES, I hold AMD stock.\n\nI bought $25K back in 2013, when the stock was at $2.46 (on January 18th, 2013), a bit over 10150 stocks. I saw the stock go up to $20 and sold half of it in 2018. Later, I bought back a bit (crazy ape mentality).\n\nToday, I stand with 7500 stocks. Certainly worth a couple of Lambo's, yet I drive a Nissan.\n\nIf you ask me, my next car should be a TESLA... with AMD chips (yet I'm not selling AMD).\n\nWE ALREADY PASSED THE MOON, we will pass **MARS** (Tesla) and also our **Galaxy** (Samsung).\n\n# Join me, together we will conquer the Universe!!!\n\nPack your bananas.... we're in for a journey!",

        "selftext": " **Section 1: What is Cano Health?**\n\nCano Health is a Florida centered value based care provider serving 103,000 people in America across 12 markets. That number is projected to grow to 300,000 by 2023. Cano Health is a primary care provider compensated through a fixed per member monthly fee from insurance companies. Because of this, Cano Health (and comparable companies) assume all risk and reap all benefits from costs of treatment. This structure incentivizes preventative care to stop health issues before they happen, which means lower costs for patients and Cano Health. This can be seen in action through Cano\u2019s lower than average mortality rates, hospital admissions and ER visits. Cano Health recently went through a reverse merger with Jaws Acquisition Corp, and now trades publicly as $Cano. Cano Health presents us with an investment opportunity that has more than 100% upside, all the while allowing us to invest in a high growth and high TAM company with great institutional backing. \n\n[Cano has seen massive growth over the past 3-4 years, and will continue to do so.](https://preview.redd.it/12nbkmoosp571.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=687218b838465602af10c8d0ebb8e34c54dfde13)\n\n[Medicare Advantage has seen good YoY growth, taking market share from Original Medicare.](https://preview.redd.it/ylynderpsp571.png?width=520&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=942e873c81e68da047a82c9dcc27c0f5f17526aa)\n\n**Section 2: How do Medicare and Medicare advantage work for senior citizens?**\n\nMedicare is a government run taxpayer funded health insurance program for primarily senior citizens over the age of 65 (barring some exceptions). Medicare allows senior citizens to go to any care provider who accepts it and receive treatment/care. Medicare is broken up into 4 key parts, which are the following:\n\n1. **Medicare Part A:** Medicare Part A covers **Inpatient Care in Hospitals, Skilled Nursing Facility Care, Hospice Care and Home Health Care.** This is generally at a low cost to most seniors, provided they have paid Medicare taxes for a long enough period. They still may have some coinsurance payments and deductibles however.\n2. **Medicare Part B:** Medicare Part B covers **Services from doctors and other health care providers, Outpatient care, Home health care, Durable medical equipment (DME) (like wheelchairs, walkers, hospital beds, and other equipment), and Many preventive services (like screenings, shots or vaccines, and yearly \u201cWellness\u201d visits).** Patients using Medicare Part B generally have to pay a monthly fee (similar to normal health insurance), and in doing so, any care received by the patient is covered and paid for by Medicare. \n3. **Medicare Part C:** Medicare Part C is also known as Medicare advantage. This is essentially an all in one package that serves as an alternative to Original Medicare (Parts A and B). Medicare Part C is fulfilled through private companies which are vetted and approved by Medicare. These packages generally include the benefits offered in Medicare Parts A, B and D, but may also include other services such as **vision, hearing and dental.** \n4. **Medicare Part D:** Medicare Part D is an optional Medicare program run by private companies who are regulated by Medicare. It\u2019s primary purpose is to **Help Cover Costs of Prescription Drugs and Protect Patients Against Future Increases in Drug Prices.**\n\nCurrently, there are 24.1 million seniors on Medicare Advantage plans, representing \\~30% of all Medicare patients. This creates a massive TAM of tens of millions of new customers, representing billions of dollars.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l3t86646tp571.jpg?width=850&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=994255c5136b8c45e635c313b77966a1bd5e5e4e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9i5htl97tp571.jpg?width=850&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfc5757a16b9b96cf03edfef9b1bba759b39ef05\n\n**Section 3: How does a value based care model differ from a fee for service (FFS) model?**\n\nTraditionally, Medicare has run on a fee for service model. This model operates like such: A patient comes into a Medicare accepting facility for a routine health checkup. 10 tests are run on the patient whilst they are there. In the fee for service model, Medicare is billed for all 10 of these tests individually. This model creates incentive for more individual services (Volume) to be done on patients, rather than high quality and important care. Under fee-for-service models, cost variations for procedures and tests increased and the healthcare industry was spending more to treat patients even though patient outcomes were not necessarily improving. The model also challenged provider workflows because physicians were seeing more patients and each claim had to be processed in a fragmented network. On the flipside, Value based care models create a much better environment for everyone. Value based care models are based on patient outcomes, not quantity of services provided to patients. Unlike the traditional fee for service model, value-based care is driven by data because providers must report to payers on specific metrics and demonstrate improvement. Providers may have to track and report on hospital readmissions, adverse events, population health, patient engagement, and more.\n\n[Cano Health has successfully lowered Mortality Rates, Hospital Admissions and ER Visits despite Covid-19 and all the challenges brought with it which proves the model's success.](https://preview.redd.it/1ox6pubbtp571.jpg?width=850&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=296b4cee7602393006b7449f521baefb880a925f)\n\n**4. What makes Cano a good investment?**\n\nCano Health has many compelling arguments as to why it is criminally undervalued, and they are the following:\n\n1. **40% organic annual membership growth with additional growth from acquisitions.**\n2. **Has strong tailwinds in an industry with increasing pressure for cost reductions, and a shift towards value based care from fee for service care.**\n3. **Cano currently serves 113k members in 15 different markets. With this, they only have 6% penetration in existing markets. The overall TAM is enormous at 24.1M Medicare Advantage enrollees in 2020 with that set to grow in the future years. This leaves Cano with plenty of runway to grow organically and through acquisitions**\n4. **Extremely favorable comps to OSH which put a fair value for this at \\~30 dollars based on revenue multiples.**\n5. **86% revenue CAGR**\n6. **Raised ebitda, revenue and membership guidance from management.**\n7. **Recent acquisition of University Health Care, increasing their market share and exposure in Florida, a place which is among states with the highest enrollments in Medicare Advantage in the country.**\n8. **Reputable Analyst Nephron Research initiated a price target of $22 dollars, with more to follow from other institutions in the near future.**\n9. **Great institutional PIPE holdings from the likes of Fidelity, Blackrock and Third Point, who in addition purchased shares from the open market to add to their holdings.**  \n\n\n![img](08izxatitp571 \"Cano Health Trades at a fraction of its competitors Revenue/EBITDA multiples.\n\")\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8k7qdfomtp571.jpg?width=850&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b395bac22cad1dd738064f5c5edd4db0ee40b7b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p1hbz71xtp571.jpg?width=1641&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0160dad2e6ecdbf8630571dbcbe1e4ee0061091\n\n[Cano holds many advantages over it's 1:1 competitor OSH.](https://preview.redd.it/5sou84n1up571.png?width=631&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba8f1ff62e56f62d70487b558e7c0f63a7b55122)\n\nCano Health has a significant connection and exposure to the hispanic population in not only Florida, but other states as well. 85% of their employees are bilingual and 80% of Cano\u2019s members are minorities. Most of the largest states for Medicare have substantial minority, Spanish speaking populations, which gives Cano lots of room for expansion, and a moat over other companies such as OSH. \n\n**How Do The Charts Look?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[For many months, Cano has been in an upward channel which seems like it will continue.](https://preview.redd.it/yn0f0d68up571.png?width=1547&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41305e9dc038178298bc6813fdd82bc2d699e6a5)\n\n**Positions or Ban?** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ I am currently long 100 October 15 12.5 calls, however any calls from July onward are fine, though there is inherent risk to buying shorter dated ones. Shares are also a good buy. ](https://preview.redd.it/p3terg8eup571.png?width=706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65ffed244ab30c7633d65bf717d0d48e6fe53b4a)\n\n**Tldr:** Cano Health is a criminally undervalued Medicare Advantage company with favorable valuations and metrics vs direct competitors such as $OSH. Cano has a massive TAM and good CAGR, and is a multibagger opportunity that should hit $30 in the near future. \n\n**Sources:**\n\n[https://www.medicare.gov/Pubs/pdf/11306-Medicare-Medicaid.pdf](https://www.medicare.gov/Pubs/pdf/11306-Medicare-Medicaid.pdf)\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1800682/000110465920124051/tm2035668d1\\_ex99-2.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1800682/000110465920124051/tm2035668d1_ex99-2.htm)\n\n[https://www.decorm.com/the-basics-of-value-based-care/](https://www.decorm.com/the-basics-of-value-based-care/)\n\n[https://twitter.com/spacanpanman/status/1399560672237830145](https://twitter.com/spacanpanman/status/1399560672237830145)\n\n[https://www.aetna.com/employers-organizations/resources/value-based-care.html](https://www.aetna.com/employers-organizations/resources/value-based-care.html)\n\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/value-based-care-pay-for-performance-healthcare-model](https://www.businessinsider.com/value-based-care-pay-for-performance-healthcare-model)\n\n[https://www.midlandgroup.com/blog/make-your-medical-facility-profitable-with-a-focus-on-value-based-care/](https://www.midlandgroup.com/blog/make-your-medical-facility-profitable-with-a-focus-on-value-based-care/)\n\n[https://www.medicare.gov/what-medicare-covers/your-medicare-coverage-choices/whats-medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/what-medicare-covers/your-medicare-coverage-choices/whats-medicare)\n\n[https://canohealth.com/medicare-advantage/](https://canohealth.com/medicare-advantage/)\n\n[https://www.medicareinteractive.org/get-answers/medicare-health-coverage-options/medicare-advantage-plan-overview/medicare-advantage-basics](https://www.medicareinteractive.org/get-answers/medicare-health-coverage-options/medicare-advantage-plan-overview/medicare-advantage-basics)?\n\n[https://www.medicareinteractive.org/get-answers/medicare-basics/medicare-coverage-overview/original-medicare](https://www.medicareinteractive.org/get-answers/medicare-basics/medicare-coverage-overview/original-medicare)\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-13/sternlicht-backed-cano-said-to-near-deal-for-university-health](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-13/sternlicht-backed-cano-said-to-near-deal-for-university-health)\n\n[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cano-health-acquires-university-health-care-for-600-million-and-increases-2021-adjusted-ebitda-guidance-to-over-100-million-301311363.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cano-health-acquires-university-health-care-for-600-million-and-increases-2021-adjusted-ebitda-guidance-to-over-100-million-301311363.html)\n\n[https://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/part-b-costs](https://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/part-b-costs)\n\n[https://catalyst.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/CAT.17.0558](https://catalyst.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/CAT.17.0558)\n\n[https://www.decorm.com/the-basics-of-value-based-care/](https://www.decorm.com/the-basics-of-value-based-care/)\n\n[https://revcycleintelligence.com/features/what-is-value-based-care-what-it-means-for-providers](https://revcycleintelligence.com/features/what-is-value-based-care-what-it-means-for-providers)",

        "selftext": "C3.ai(NYSE:AI)\n\nSector: Technology\n\nIndustry: Information Technology Services\n\nMarket cap: [6B](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AI?p=AI)\n\nC3.ai, Inc is an enterprise artificial intelligence company. The company provides software-as-a-service applications that enable customers to rapidly develop, deploy, and operate large-scale Enterprise AI applications across any infrastructure. It provides solutions under three divisions namely:\n\n* The C3 AI Suite: proprietary model-driven architecture, addresses the requirements for the digital transformation software stack, providing a low-code/no-code AI and Internet of Things, or IoT, platform that accelerates software development, reduces cost and risk, and delivers applications that are flexible enough to meet evolving needs.\n* C3 AI Applications: a large and growing family of industry-specific and application-specific turnkey AI solutions that can be immediately installed and deployed such as:\n   * Inventory Optimization: a solution to optimize raw material, in-process, and finished goods inventory levels\n   * Supply Network Risk: provides visibility into risks of disruption throughout the supply chain operations for enterprise supply chain managers\n   * Customer Churn Management: enables account executives and relationship managers to monitor customer satisfaction using transactional, behavioral, and contextual information, as well as to take action to prevent customer churn with AI-based and human-interpretable predictions and warning\n   * Production Schedule Optimization: a solution for scheduling production \n   * Predictive Maintenance: provides insight into asset risk to maintenance planners and equipment operators\n   * Fraud Detection solution\n   * Energy Management solution \n* C3.ai Ex Machina: analytics for applying data science to every-day business decisions\n\n**FINANCIALS**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/zudwz718ew471.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12d05673719c96e4bce13e8389d0f2c8a63f3006)\n\nC3 is growing rapidly with a total revenue of $156.7M in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2020 compared to $91.6M in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2019 representing a year-over-year growth of 71%. Over the same period, the subscription revenue grew to $135.4M from $77.5M representing a 75% increase.\n\nC3 has high total contract values for software subscriptions. The average total subscription contract values were:\n\n* 2016: $1.2M\n* 2017: $11.7M\n* 2018: $10.8M\n* 2019: $16.2M\n* 2020: $12.1M\n\n**BULL ARGUMENT**\n\nC3 has a first-mover advantage in Enterprise AI due to investment into their products and technology over the last decade. They have \u201cLighthouse Customers\u201d, or large global early adopters, in Europe, Asia, and the United States across a range of industries that serve as proof points for other potential customers. Some customers include:\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/6v6m5kedew471.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e44125b37976abacc041856b3b4fda5e7608a95)\n\nThere is an extensive partner ecosystem that includes strategic relationships with established technology leaders like:\n\n* [Amazon Web Services](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181010005314/en/C3-and-Amazon-Web-Services-Expand-Collaboration-to-Drive-Enterprise-Artificial-Intelligence-Adoption)\n* Fidelity National Information Services\n* [Google](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180821005202/en/C3-IoT-and-Google-Cloud-Announce-Partnership)\n* [IBM](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-02-27/correcting-and-replacing-ibm-services-and-c3-ai-announce-strategic-alliance-for-digital-transformation-with-ai)\n* [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/09/microsoft-sees-gain-on-c3ai-investment-concurrent-with-ipo.html)\n\nAlthough the average total subscription value is decreasing and may continue to decrease, C3 has restructured the sales organization and expanded the market-partner ecosystem to address small, medium, and large sales opportunities. The progress is promising as the average total subscription contract value for six months ended October 31, 2020 was $7.7M.\n\nOn February 1, 2021, the [launch of the Open AI Energy Initiative](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-c3-ai-baker-hughes-220000073.html) was announced by Shell, C3, Baker Hughes, and Microsoft. The initiative provides a framework for energy operators, service providers, equipment providers, and independent software vendors for energy services to offer interoperable solutions powered by the [BHC3 AI Suite](https://bakerhughesc3.ai/bhc3-ai-suite/model-driven-architecture/) and Microsoft Azure.\n\n**BEAR ARGUMENT**\n\nC3 faces intense competition and which could be an \u201cearly bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese\u201d type of situation as second movers could develop technology to improve upon any shortfalls. The main sources of potential competition include:\n\n* Greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and larger customer bases\n* Larger sales and marketing budgets and resources, and the capacity to leverage their sales efforts and marketing across a broader portfolio\n* Wider geographic presence\n* Lower labor and research and development costs\n* Larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios\n* Greater financial, technical, and other resources to provide support, make acquisitions, hire talent, and to develop and introduce new products\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer, Tom Siebel has received many [honors and awards](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181112005818/en/EY-Honors-Thomas-M.-Siebel-as-2018-Entrepreneur-Of-The-Year%C2%AE), but if he, or other senior management team members, were to leave the company C3 may not be able to execute their business strategy. Siebel is critical to the overall management and continued development of the AI suite and AI Applications. All of the executive officers are at-will employees and they do not maintain any key person life insurance policies.\n\nC3 has a history of operating losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future. The sales cycles can be long and unpredictable and the sales efforts require considerable time and expense. This is due to investing into sales to large organizations that typically undertake a significant evaluation and negotiation process due to their leverage, size, organization structure, and approval requirements. A limited number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of C3\u2019s revenue. The top three entities together accounted for 34% and 44% of the revenue for years ended April 30, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The same entities have been with C3 for an average of 3.3 years.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nGiven the success of C3\u2019s customers, I feel it will increase penetration of their existing customer base. They are primed to expand the major account sales organization to focus on large enterprise software agreements. Additionally, C3 will continue to develop high volume distribution channels to address the needs of small and medium businesses. I think they will continue to bring new product families to market that will develop into substantial recurring revenue streams. The total addressable market is rapidly growing and estimated to grow to $271B in 2024, a 12% CAGR from 2020's estimate of $174B.  This is a big opportunity for C3.  The lock up period [ended on June 7, 2021](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/ipos/overview?dealId=907559-94759), and earnings happened on June 2, 2021. I believe everyone who wanted to sell has sold at this point. I am bullish and think C3 has great potential for a swing trade, but more so a long-term investment. \n\n*I am not a financial advisor.

I was looking into it, just out of curiosity - for those who aren\u2019t aware, GBTC is an ETF whose underlying trust has only one asset - Bitcoin - and as a result, its market price mirrors BTC pretty much perfectly.\n\nWhat appeals to me is not having to worry about additional accounts and security related to crypto keys. As of right now, I don\u2019t hold any digital offerings, but I\u2019d like to expose myself to BTC and other (admittedly volatile) assets in a long-term fund.\n\nArticles that mention Grayscale Trust reference its 2% fee and $50,000 minimum, which are extraordinarily high for any typical market offering right now (obviously, BTC and other digital currencies aren\u2019t \u201ctypical\u201d investments by any means, but the opportunity cost of whatever i may invest in GBTC is like a total market fund like FZROX). But from my Fidelity account, it doesn\u2019t appear there is a minimum investment nor a holding fee. Is anyone familiar with this trust, and is the ETF (GBTC) different than the trust itself?

        "selftext": "I've been in the investing world for a little bit of time, maybe about 5 years in total, and only within the last year and a half or so have I gotten really into it and doing more, in-depth research on companies and ETF's and the like.  While I have a decent enough understanding of what I'm doing to ensure that I am generally in the green on my portfolio so I'm content with that, but I always am trying to learn more and really make my investments for the long term gains rather than short term quick profits.  I have a rather demanding job at times and so I'm a lot more interested in set it and forget it type investments than constant monitoring.  \n\nSo this gets me to the meat of my question:  I have read multiple posts and comments across Reddit recommending VOO, VTI, and the like.  I understand that both of those are ETF's that track the S&amp;P500 and total market respectfully.  They each have a cost basis to them of 0.03% which makes sense.  VTSAX is also recommended for folks who have a little more money in the game because it has a buy-in minimum of $2500 right now with a cost basis 0f 0.03%.  I use Fidelity as my brokerage and I was researching these funds and noticed one offered Fidelity called FXIAX that acts pretty much identical to VTSAX and VOO but has a $0 buy-in with a cost basis of 0.015% which seems a lot more desirable to me as it meets all the things I'm looking for and is about 50% cheaper than the vanguard options.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I missing something in my overall evaluation or is FXIAX just not generally talked abiout in general which is why I never saw it?",

It is going public via SPAC namely dMY Technology III. \n\nIn it\u2019s latest fundraising it secured a further $82m funding from: Google Ventures, AWS, Samsung, Airbus, Lockheed Martin and Bosch. The funding is being used to develop \u2018trapped ion computing technology\u2019 which is able to operate at room temperature and has the longest lifetime of any qubit. \n\nIonQ\u2019s founders wanted to build the most powerful quantum computer using trapped ytterbium atoms. This method, whilst not the most common has unique advantages including low error correction, high gate fidelity, scalability, noise reduction, less space required and lower costs to operate, as it requires no refrigeration and minimal electrical costs. \n\nThe founders Jungsang Kim and Christopher Monroe both bring formidable technical credentials. Jungsang Kim leads the multifunctional integrated systems tech group at Duke University, where his lab leads the world in miniaturisation of quantum systems. Christopher Monroe has been working on quantum computing for 25 years and demonstrated the first ever quantum logic gate. Between them they have secured over $160m in grants. \n\nDespite quantum computing being in its infancy they expect to earn $5m of revenues in 2021, with the long term business model being Quantum computing as a service (QcAAS) possible due to increased scalability being an advantage of the trapped ion method. \n\nTo summarise quantum computing is one of the next big technological advancements, they have attracted the best business and technical minds of any quantum computing business to date.  If you factor in the increased scalability and how much backing/pipe investment (Silver Lake, Fidelity, Hyundai, Time Ventures, Breakthrough Energy, MSD capital) they\u2019ve secured it looks like they are financially secure, have first mover advantage and are in pole position to capitalise on the future shift to quantum computing.",

However, their lack of history makes number crunching a bit harder, and I was hoping someone here has already determined which of the more mainstream funds most closely align with the four above. I'm most interest in Vanguard, but Fidelity and Charles Schwab would provide me with good data as well.\n\nI have too much money sitting in cash and even though I'll eventually have to pay taxes on it all, I want my money to work for me instead of my bank.

Acorns, an investing app that offers a suite of investment, banking, and financial education services for low monthly fees, revealed it's going public by combining with an existing company, Pioneer Merger Corp. (NASDAQ:PACX). The company said this places the equity value of its business at roughly $2.2 billion.\n\nPioneer Merger is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), which is an entity created and listed with the sole purpose of bringing an existing business to the stock market quickly.\n\nTwo people gazing at their respective smartphones.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.\nAfter Acorns fuses together with Pioneer Merger, the new entity will operate as Acorns Holdings. Its stock should trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol OAKS. Current Acorns CEO Noah Kerner will also be at the helm of the new company. \n\nAcorns said that Kerner and Pioneer Merger's sponsor aim to pass along 10% of their respective positions in the new company to eligible customers through a share-ownership program. It didn't provide details of this initiative.\n\nIn its press release trumpeting the move, Acorns quoted Kerner as saying that, \"Going public will help elevate our story, introduce many more people to the power of compounding and financial wellness, and bring financial literacy to the mainstream.\"\n\nAcorns said that both its and Pioneer Merger's board of directors have unanimously approved their business combination. It remains subject to approval by the latter company's shareholders. Acorns said the deal should close in the second half of this year.\n\nWhile the publicly traded, cutting-edge fintech space is getting quite crowded, Acorns has a novel business profile and operates a popular app. This should attract plenty of attention from investors looking to profit on the future of the financial services industry.",

Already well known in Europe, Paysafe reports a substantial $362 million in free cash flow, projects $100 billion in transactional volume, $1.5 billion in revenue, healthy double-digit growth and expanding $30%+ EBITDA margins, but, despite absolutely no negative news, the stock has taken a pounding which, in turn, has brought the bears out in force with some dubious arguments. Sorry for the long post, but I thought I'd address all of these arguments in one post:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCommon bear arguments:\n\n\\#1 Old business\n\n\\#2 Complex regulatory landscape / no moat\n\n\\#3 Growth by acquisition is risky and difficult\n\n\\#4 No growth\n\n\\#5 Slow growth\n\n\\#6 Not profitable\n\n\\#7 Too I much debt / they are going to dilute by borrowing more.\n\n\\#8 Blackstone made 3X and will sell\n\n\\#9 Founder share and warrant dilution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#1) Old business. \n\nPaysafe\u2019s extensive experience in risk management and its time-tested regulatory expertise over many regions globally is one of its greatest strengths. This is the reason that Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a rapidly moving space that is anticipated to grow 10X. \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nMuch of Paysafe\u2019s business is in back-end payment processing so most don\u2019t even know they are using it, but Paysafe is considered to be at the forefront in its field: Winner \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d and they are rapidly expanding in the US with new partnerships (just last 3 months: Coinbase, Microsoft, Luckbox, Amelco, Pointsbet, Virginia Lotto)\n\nIn Europe, where Paysafe is more known and used, Trustpilot (1) rates Paysafe as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars) with over 25,000 reviews, and Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews, while PayPal is rated \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews.\n\nPaysafe has the No. 2 global digital wallet with presence in 120 countries. They\u2019ve just integrated their digital wallet platforms, Neteller and Skrill, recently voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n\nAside from Coinbase, Luckbox and Microsoft, they are partnered with Roblox, Draftkings, Spotify, Fortnight, Amazon, Twitch, bet365, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, BetMGM, among many others. They are currently moving quickly to integrate their services to offer easier migration of eCash, integration of payment methods, cross-border payments and expansion into global banking as a service.\u00a0\n\nIn preparation for their plans, Paysafe's newly announced Board of Directors includes a former Morgan Stanley CEO, a former Chairman of the American Gaming Association and CEO of MGM Resorts International, a legal and regulatory expert in the multi-jurisdictional online and retail gambling industries, two senior Managing Directors from Blackstone, two from CVC, the CEO of Dun &amp; Bradstreet and CEO of Black Knight, and the Chairman of the Board of Fidelity.\n\nAs Chairman Bill Foley says, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab\u2026I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet\u2026 It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\" This doesn't sound like an old company resting on its laurels. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#2) Complex regulatory landscape / no moat. \n\nBill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now also Paysafe\u2019s Chairman of the Board, calls Paysafe,\u201ca fortress. It\u2019s got a moat\u2026 We have a proven strategy of winning as new global markets open. And most importantly, we have unrivaled regulatory risk and technical expertise.\" Their regulatory acumen is the reason they currently dominate globally in sports betting/iGaming and are integrating their global platforms to expand into banking as a service. There are 1.7 billion \"unbanked\" because so many in the world who have mobile devices, still don't have access to the essential ID metrics that most banks and credit cards require to open accounts. Paysafe's risk management and cross boarder regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant to go. Leaning into this strength, they've brought on PayPal's former CRO and added a multi-jurisdictional regulatory expert to their Board of Directors\n\nFrom SEC filed transcript (2) - Paysafe CEO, Philip McHugh: \u201cTo be a true global player in the iGaming space, the level of payments regulation, of gaming regulation and certification is very, very complex. When we talk about a deep and a wide moat, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be a winner in this space, you\u2019re catering to some incredibly demanding clients. They want to be global, they want multiple APMs, but they want you to understand payment regulation in hundreds of countries in gaming and gambling regulation in hundreds of countries. That\u2019s something that Paysafe has developed very, very successfully in every market we\u2019ve entered.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#3) Growth by acquisition is hard. \n\nSynergistic inorganic growth through M&amp;A is a key pillar of Paysafe\u2019s forward growth strategy. Bill Foley's proven track record in quickly generating this kind of growth speaks for itself. Over the last five years Foley has grown Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X). Foley says, \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d (2, 4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#4) No growth. \n\nIt\u2019s true that Paysafe\u2019s revenue stagnated in 2020 resulting from business closures during Covid, but prior to that they reported a strong 27% CAGR (4,5), which is on par with high profile competitors:\n\n2017: $864 million rev\n\n2018 : $1.14 billion rev (+32%)\n\n2019 : $1.418 billion rev (+24%).\n\n2020 : $1.426 billion. (+0.5%)\n\nUnlike many fintechs, Paysafe has heavy exposure in brick-and-mortar retail and live sporting events, both of which were absolutely crushed in 2020 due to Covid. During this market dislocation, they pivoted, \u201cexited low value referral channels\u201d and made up revenue by expanding in the digital wallets and e-commmerce spaces, positioning themselves better going forward.\n\nLooking at other brick-and-mortar payment processors hard-hit during the same period, like Visa and Mastercard, Paysafe performed very well by comparison:\n\n\u2014Visa: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-8.7%) and negative EBITDA growth (-10.2%)\n\n\u2014 Mastercard: negative y-o-y revenue growth (-9.4%) and negative EBITDA growth (-14.20%)\n\nNot claiming that Paysafe should be valued according to these two traditional payment processors but, given their commensurate slow down during Covid, it is interesting to note that their their averaged EV/Revenue multiples would put Paysafe at $46, which is very much in line with the valuation comps cited below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#5) Slow growth. \n\nGoing forward, Paysafe conservatively projects $10-13% annual growth over the next two years but they are careful so say that those growth projections exclude M&amp;A plans and expansion in iGaming which is expected to grow at 55% CAGR over the next several years. iGaming accounts for over a third of Paysafe\u2019s revenue so this growth is a significant exclusion.\n\nAnalyst Michael Del Grosso, who recently initiated coverage with a $19 price target (6) said, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d\n\nIn the short time since he wrote that, here are some of the headlines signaling a price target upgrade:\n\n1 \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n\n2 \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n\n3 New Hampshire: \"Sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n\n4 \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n\n5 \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n\n6 \u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\n\n7 \"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\n\n8 \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n\n9 \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n\n10 \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n\n11 \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n\n12 \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n\n13 \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n\n14 \"Single-sports betting in Canada wins House vote, nears legalization\"\n\n15 \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n\n16 \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at a larger basket of comps with a collective growth rate of \\~12.5% (not far from Paysafe\u2019s minimum 10.6% projection) here are valuations based on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign among others:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter eliminating outliers with highest multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage :$46.52\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNotes:\n\n1 Unlike Paysafe, around half of these competitors report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow.\n\n2 Used low end of Paysafe's projections and factored in debt and high-end of potential dilution.\n\n3 As noted Paysafe\u2019s 10.6% rev growth projection excludes planned inorganic M&amp;A growth and projected 55% CAGR iGaming growth, which constitutes a third of their revenue.\n\n4 The above comps were taken during a sector-wide pull-back and do not reflect recent fintech gains since Jamie Dimon\u2019s \"enormous competitive threats\" comment.\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers projects roughly 20% more growth than Paysafe yet trades at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#6) Not profitable. \n\nPaysafe expects $900 million in gross profit with healthy 30-32% EBITDA margin. As one recent article pointed out, \u201cPaysafe has shown some intriguing projections in terms of its profitability. The company\u2019s projected gross margin is 63%, an impressive number compared to competitors like Square with a gross margin under 30%.\u201d\nThese fintech competitors are trading at much higher multiples but have worse EPS than Paysafe:\n\nRepay: -0.67,\n\nAffirm : -2.18,\n\nNuvei : -1.08,\n\nPaysign : -0.19.\n\nBill : -0.62,\n\nShift4 : -0.43\n\nAverage EV/EBITDA multiples of the above companies would put Paysafe's SP at $69\nIf you read their transcripts and presentations, you\u2019ll see that profit is being utilized to grow the business and integrate their global platforms into what they call Paysafe Unity. They\u2019ve recently completed the integration of Skrill and Neteller digital wallets into a single code. Foley has indicated further elimination of redundancies to create new efficiencies and increase margins to enhance M&amp;A activities. From what I can tell, Foley is all about the long game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#7) Too I much debt / they are going to dilute by borrowing more.   \nPaysafe just paid down $1.1 billion in debt. Why would they turn around and borrow again? As Fidelity\u2019s Chairman of the Board, Bill Foley says: \u201cOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe\u2019s leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.\u201d\n\nTheir 3.6X Debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintech peers. Investopedia: \u201cDebt/EBITDA measures a company's ability to pay off its incurred debt. A high ratio result could indicate a company has a too-heavy debt load.\u201d \n\nOf the 11 fintech competitors I looked at, all but three (PYPL, ADYEY, NUVCF), have worse Debt/EBITDA ratios than Paysafe and many have negative EBITDA, making debt service that much more difficult:\n\nSquare: 77.8X\n\nRepay : 8.7X\n\nFiserv : $21.2B / $4.7B : 4.5X\n\nGPN : $10.27B / $2.8B : 3.67X\n\nShift4 : $1.8B / -$8M : negative EBITDA\n\nAffirm : $1.67B / -77.6M negative EBITDA\n\nPaysign : $4.3M / -$5.79M : negative EBITDA\n\nBill : $947M / -43.85M : negative EBITDA\n\nDepending on whether you include SQ and AFRM, the combined multiples of the above competitors (by EV/EBITDA, EV/free cash flow or EV/revenue) puts Paysafe\u2019s share price in the $45 to $90 range. Point being, their debt position is better than most and hardly a red flag. Further, management has said they\u2019ll be able to fund M&amp;A plans with expanding 32-35%+ EBITDA margins ($500 - 560 million, 21% CAGR) and $362 million in free cash flow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#8) Blackstone made 3X and will sell. \n\nThe common myth is that Blackstone/CVC made 300% by paying $3 billion to take Paysafe private and receiving $9 billion in the recent deal to bring it public. The reality, as reported by the Wall Street Journal (8), is that Blackstone/CVC took Paysafe private in 2017 for $3.9 Billion and they received about $5.6 billion in cash and shares on the recent deal. Adjusted for inflation, they paid $4.2 billion so it\u2019s more like a 33% return on a 4 year hold.\n\nImportantly, this came AFTER they grew revenue 65% ($864B to $1.426B), stewarded a billion in investments to grow the business, and the deal included paying down over $1.1 billion in debt. This suggests Foley cut a great deal for shareholders. It also explains why private equity has signaled that they'll stay on long term to reap much bigger gains through Foley\u2019s time-tested M&amp;A playbook.\n\nBlackstone itself says (9), \u201cThe term of private equity funds can be upwards of 7-10 years.\u201d With so much runway and comps pointing to a 3-4X valuation, why would Blackstone leave so much money on the table?\n\nBlackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler signals an ongoing interest in staying on: \u201cWe believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.\u201d\n\nIn a recent interview Foley said, private equity\u2019s plan to stay on was part of what encouraged PIPE to invest $2 billion: \u201cThey rolled a significant amount of their investment which is a confidence builder. They didn\u2019t take all their money off the table\u2026All of these things put together really created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the stock.\u201d\n\nThis trust was reiterated in the SEC filed FTAC\u2019s Board of Directors\u2019 Reasons for the Approval of the Business Combination: \u201cCommitment of Paysafe\u2019s Owners. The FTAC Board believes that the CVC Investors, the Blackstone Investors and other current indirect stockholders of PGHL continuing to own a substantial percentage of the post-combination company on a pro forma basis reflects such stockholders\u2019 belief in and commitment to the continued growth prospects of Paysafe going forward.\u201d\n\nThe PIPE investors are even less of a concern because they are title and life insurance companies known for long-term investment strategies, they are closely aligned with Foley and understand both his M&amp;A track record and his ability to create mutually beneficial synergistic deals through what Bloomberg called the \u201cThe Foley Network\u201d (perhaps, for example, Paysafe will handle Fidelity\u2019s massive transactional volume). \nIn a recent Bloomberg interview, Bill Foley said, \u201cThe thing that was different about our transaction is that we brought capital to the table. The companies that I\u2019m affiliated with actually invested roughly a billion dollars in the PIPE and forward purchase agreements so Paysafe was always a really protected asset besides the fact that it\u2019s a great asset.\u201d\n\nBesides, just as large funds will often drive price down to accumulate large positions, they also can drive price up to sell into strength and will do so via off-market trades to avoid price slippage. Therefore, we probably wouldn\u2019t even notice profit taking until after quarterly filings. Paysafe\u2019s fundamental value in context indicates such prospects present very little long term risk, especially from current price levels. Given Paysafe's $100B market share (similar to Square\u2019s), once audited numbers are available, many large funds focused on this space will necessarily seek a more balanced exposure through Paysafe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#9) Founder share and warrant dilution. \n\nAccording to the 20F recently filed, roughly 53 million warrants pose potential dilution at a maximum of 7.5% (movement we've seen in a day), but the cashless conversion option, generally exchanging 3 warrants for a single share, can reduce that dilution by 2/3 to around 2.5%. It is very likely that many will use this option since most warrant holders do not have the extra cash to pay an additional $11.50 for each warrant conversion. It will probably be somewhere in the middle of the two scenarios (\\~5%) but this is not a major concern in the scheme of things.\n\nImportantly, the 20F also shows that all founder shares are already included in the current outstanding share count so there is no risk of dilution there.\n\nTotal FTAC Founder shares 175,292,458 24.2 %\u00a0\n\nBlackstone Investors 123,734,571 17.1 %\u00a0\n\nCVC Investors 156,006,433 21.6 %\u00a0\n\nOther Pre-Business Combination Paysafe Shareholders 53,701,074 7.4 %\u00a0\n\nCannae (excluding amounts included in Founder) 50,000,000 6.9 %\u00a0\n\nPIPE Investors (excluding Cannae) 165,000,000 22.8 %\u00a0\n\n723,734,536 100.0 %\u00a0\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite a lack of negative news, short sellers and bashers have been able to exploit a perfect storm of doubt created by seemingly unrelated events ranging from forced selling pressure coming from widely reported changes in margin requirements (25% to 100% upon ticker change without any prior notice), to simultaneous limits on buying resulting from excessive delays (7+ trading days) in the new PSFE ticker being available on many platforms, to things in the media that this sub will not allow to be discussed.  In this context, it is hard not to see a month's worth of \u201cfake sell walls\u201d and HFS \u201cshort ladder attacks\u201d as anything other than opportunistic price manipulation but, speculation can only get you so far. \n\nI think Paysafe is currently undervalued and, as the developments in legalized sports betting come to fruition, it is very likely a 3X from here. M&amp;A plans already in the works will bring additional catalysts. Given Paysafe's healthy fundamentals, large market share in a fintech space known for \u201csticky\u201d customers, and exposure to high growth verticals like iGaming, it seems inevitable that large funds will seek to benefit from these low prices, especially once the first audited quarterly numbers are available on May 11th.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: Per their analyst presentation, here is Paysafe\u2019s minimum Q1 guidance to meet or beat:\n\n$360 million revenue\n\n$220 million gross profit\n\n$105 million EBITDA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclosure: I hold $600K in commons and warrants\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. All users should complete their own due diligence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\n(1) Trustpilot\u00a0[https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n(2) Transcript:\u00a0[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001818355/000119312520311318/d91054d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001818355/000119312520311318/d91054d425.htm)\n\n(3) 20F\u00a0[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000119312521104105/d159702d20f.htm#toc](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000119312521104105/d159702d20f.htm#toc)\n\n(4) Investor Presentation:\u00a0[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm)\n\n(5) Analyst Presentation:\u00a0[https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n(6) Analyst $19\u00a0[https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html)\n\n(7) S1:\u00a0[https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/)\n\n(8) WSJ:\u00a0[https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstone-cvc-to-buy-paysafe-for-3-9-billion-in-latest-online-payments-deal-1501830827](https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstone-cvc-to-buy-paysafe-for-3-9-billion-in-latest-online-payments-deal-1501830827)\n\n(9) Blackstone:\u00a0[https://pws.blackstone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/the\\_life\\_cycle\\_of\\_private\\_equity\\_insights.pdf](https://pws.blackstone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/the_life_cycle_of_private_equity_insights.pdf)\n\n(10) Q1 earnings call:\u00a0[https://ir.paysafe.com/news-events/events/detail/9758/first-quarter-2021-earnings-call](https://ir.paysafe.com/news-events/events/detail/9758/first-quarter-2021-earnings-call)",

Bonds have gone from Merril to Raymond James to Fidelity.  None of them has come up with any bid for us.  Can anyone suggest a way for me to effect a sale.  Perhaps a small European brokerage that would let us open an account for a single trade.  Thanks in advance.",

        "selftext": "One of my holdings has seen a lot of premarket and post market activity recently. For example, one of my holdings was up roughly 20% yesterday, up another 20% in after hours, and up again in premarket this morning - but - in Fidelity I can't see what my gains are outside of 9:30am-4pm, I can only see the value of the stock from 4pm yesterday.  That's at least 8 hours of trading without an update. My wife holds the same stock in Webull, and she gets constant updates on the value of the stock. I would need a calculator to do that.  It's 9:15 AM ET and I still don't see an update, just the 4pm balance. This is ridiculous. \n\nI like fidelity because they are local to me, and I want to help support my local economy. I also like that I can call them and get a rep on the phone if I have an issue. From what I understand support for Webull is pretty much nonexistent. \n\nSo, I'm looking for a new broker. My criteria:\n\n1. balance updates during pre and post market. I shouldn't need a calculator.\n2. A good UI\n3. A good mobile app\n4. A US broker\n5. tech support availability. If I have a serious enough issue, I will want to speak to a human.\n6. Not Thinkorswim, or Robinhood\n\nAny suggestions are welcome.",

I saw [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3nln0h/yatch_buyers_guide_direxions_3x_etfs_edition/) relative wsb post and did some research. It appears people do NOT tend to buy those specific ETFs.\n\nNow I understand how these are bad long term investments after reading this [article](https://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/2016-08-18/why-leveraged-etfs-are-horrible-investments) from us-news. But I am thinking of a short-term investment at least day trade or few weeks to at most 2 years.\n\nWatched this [segment](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2017-11-15/the-pros-and-cons-of-leveraged-etfs-video) on bloomberg on pros and cons of said ETFs. The representative also said that these ETFs are not good for long term investment. One of the ETFs, $GUSH which currently trades at \\~$92 almost hit $100,000. It has low volume however has more than $750 million in assets. \n\nTo anyone who has traded ETFs I wanted to ask:\n\n1. How long do you usually hold them\n2. Are there any decays applied to THESE ETFs. As some futures ETFs from proShare gets decayed.\n3. Does Robinhood and fidelity charge fee for trading ETFs such as $LBAD or $LABU\n4. Say if the ETF you hold goes to \\~$100,000 per share, if you were to sell, who would possibly want to buy a share of ETF for $100,000?\n\nThank you!",

To support the deal, Leo Holdings III raised $125 million via a so-called private investment in public equity, or PIPE, from investors including Fidelity Management &amp; Research Co. and Cargill Inc., the people said. Cargill is additionally slated to provide $200 million in debt financing, they added.\n\nRepresentatives for Local Bounti, based in Hamilton, Montana, Leo Holdings III and Fidelity declined to comment. A representative Cargill didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nFounded in 2018 by co-CEOs Craig Hurlbert and Travis Joyner, Local Bounti focuses on the sustainable production and delivery of fresh produce. Its proprietary technology grows leafy greens such as romaine and butter lettuce and herbs like cilantro and basil using 90% less land and water than traditional agricultural methods, and without pesticides or herbicides.\n\nThe startup in May bolstered its leadership ranks, adding Kathleen Valiasek as chief financial officer and former Beyond Meat Inc. chief financial officer Mark Nelson to its board. At the time, the company said Valiasek would help advance its plan to more than double the size of its flagship facility in Montana and to break ground on new U.S. sites.\n\nLeo Holdings III, led by Lion Capital executives Ed Forst, Lyndon Lea and Robert Darwent, raised $275 million in a February initial public offering. A prior vehicle, Leo Holdings Corp., last July completed a deal to take Digital Media Solutions Inc. public.\n\nOther disruptive agriculture companies including AeroFarms and AppHarvest Inc. have struck deals to go public via SPAC mergers.",

        "selftext": "  \n\n**Why $FTI is still my favorite stock.** \n\n*A poem was written by Haraldo*\n\nLet's get this out of the way: TLDR for the marsh dwellers that don\u2019t like reading.  And yeah, I\u2019m a new poster. I\u2019ve been lurking since the beginning of the year and admiring you from afar. \n\n* **The Fundamentals:** FTI = Oil. Oil = Bad. Inflation = bad. Inflation+Oil= maybe. Some of you like it.\n* **52- Week Performance**: +56.92%\n* **Starmine Summary**: 9.4/10 (Very Bullish(Bullish=up(up=(roc(k)et))))\n* **S&amp;P Valuation**: 84/100 underrated, 99/100 growth stability, 71/100 financial health.\n* **Short/Mid/Long Term Sentiment**: STRONG\n* **MORNINGSTAR FAIR VALUE RATING:** **$25.00** **CURRENT PRICE:** **10.00**\n* ~~Short Interest:~~ This ain\u2019t a squeeze. Sowwy. \n* Options: VERY CHEAP. Many options expiring ITM on June 18th could be executed. \n* Upcoming Catalysts: July 27th Earnings call, which should be its second profitable quarter. See below. 2nd Catalyst: Options activity for July 16th include 100 $FTI stock and 20 $THNPY.\n* My Plays: I only have 5 FTI calls for July 16th 10$ at the moment while I\u2019m waiting for my funds to transfer from Fidelity to TDAmeritrade but will be opening a YOLO position for July 16th &amp; Oct 15th. (My 9$ option sweep for June 18th played in my favor already, my money already made, so this info is here for YOU.) \n\nIF YOU DON\u2019T LIKE READING, YOU CAN STOP NOW\n\nIf you recognize this stock, you probably remember me messaging you last month since my karma rating was low. I\u2019m back, I made money with it, I\u2019m not bag holding, and I\u2019m here to tell you more. \n\n**Let's talk about oil.**\n\nI know oil companies aren\u2019t your favorite. We all want to believe in and invest in renewable energy because we\u2019re all good people deep down inside. I feel the same. But I also know why you\u2019re here. You want the Tesla. Let your oil stocks buy you a renewable energy vehicle. Shove it in their faces. \n\nBut if we\u2019re gonna be environmentally friendly while investing in oil, lets talk $FTIs progress. Their greenhouse gas emission 3-YR average is significantly lower than the average for an oil company. Despite working in regions with lower standards in 3rd-world regions, they have continued to reduce emissions and develop new technology to manufacture and implement subsea and land based oil extraction products. \n\n**Inevitable Inflation**\n\nWhen you hear oil these days, you hear a lot about inflation. A few industries are more resilient to rising inflation, and typically businesses and individuals will invest in commodities such as gold and oil or real estate to maintain their asset value through bad times. On the other side of this, traders often will turn to companies that produce such products as a hedge against inflation; as the commodities maintain value, so will their manufacturers. \n\n**Morningstar Ratings**\n\nMorningstar has given 2 reports this year giving this company a fair value rating of $25. I\u2019m a little baffled that this has been sitting here between 7-10 this entire time, but then again, I know nothing about how this works. But I know the reason behind it: FTI has eliminated most of its debt by splitting its unprofitable company into another public company with less value. This has allowed FTI to be poised in a much better position to lower its remaining debt over time. This split led to its first profitable quarter. Now, it wasn\u2019t a whopping profit, but it was profitable nonetheless. Since that day, the value of the stock has been rising on a fairly consistent basis, and the upcoming earnings report on July 27th is expected to be a much higher profit than the last quarter, given the last one was when the company had split off in the middle. Given the fair value rating, you\u2019re looking at a stock with a 150% gain possibility. And we all know what happens if theres some unusual activity on the way to a fair value. \n\n**Volume**\n\nThe average trading volume of this company is fairly low. Activity has increased tremendously over the last month not only in the traditional stock purchase but in options purchasing. I\u2019ve been watching and purchasing this stock since March (My first pick based on my own DD, its my baby and its been good to me) and I\u2019ve seen my own bids dramatically effect options prices and have seen single orders shoot the price in one direction or the other. This could cause a very volatile stock with increased volume, and could even see a massive increase from a single whale alone. \n\n**One More Thing\u2026**\n\nI\u2019m tired of typing so you\u2019re on your own from here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mvcsi6ayrj571.png?width=3230&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36cfc3f2bb78853e1ccb4b78f61f0f38dbdffb4f\n\nOur last peak here in June is predicted to be the first Elliot Wave. This could mean a potential second larger wave pushing the stock price on its own. It's having a lot of other bullish signs in the last month as you can see. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for taking the time to read. I\u2019ve made more than a years worth of salary this year alone mostly from advice you guys have given me, paid off a tremendous amount of debt, and gave me a new fun thing to do that has given me value. I hope this post can do something for someone the way others did for me. If you disagree with some opinions or find better information than me, PLEASE SHARE. Taking advice from the comments has worked so much better for me than taking the original DD to heart, and as always: Do your own DD before buying!

        "selftext": "FTOC/Payoneer DD\n\n**Positions: FTOC shares, average price $13.24. Not financial advice.**\n\n**What is FTOC/Payoneer?**\n\nFtac Olympus Acquisition Corp (FTOC) is a SPAC led by Betsy Cohen that has a definitive agreement to merge with Payoneer.\n\nPayoneer is a payment platform that offers a way for businesses to pay and receive money, for a low fee. Payoneer believes that the total addressable market (defined as global e-commerce volume) is $26 trillion a year. Payoneer processed over $44 billion in 2020 alone.\n\nPayoneer also offers:\n\n* Accounting integrations\n* Capital to small businesses\n* Regulatory and compliance infrastructure\n* Physical debit cards\n* Tax solutions\n\n**Management Team**\n\nScott Galit - CEO of Payoneer, previously a senior VP at MasterCard. Serious financial services pedigree.\n\nMichael G Levine - CFO of Payoneer, ex-City VP and ex-CFO of Maler Technologies. MBA from Wharton.\n\nBetsy Cohen - CEO of FTOC. Tons of finance related experience, including founding Bancorp. Should be able to give Payoneer great advice for future growth.\n\n**Customers**\n\nPayoneer has some big name clients, including but not limited to:\n\n* Amazon Europe\n* Google\n* eBay\n* Walmart\n* Upwork\n* Fiverr\n\nPayoneer works with 9 of the top 20 most valuable companies. Alongside these big names, Payoneer also has 5 million+ marketplaces and businesses, across over 190 countries.\n\n**Switching Costs**\n\nIntegrating, setting up, and teaching staff how to use a new payment platform can be time-consuming and expensive for businesses. Therefore, when a client is set up on Payoneer, it is unlikely that they will switch to another provider. This is best seen by the &gt;100% volume retention that Payoneer has (i.e. customers stay and increase their payment volume).\n\n**Brand**\n\nPayoneer, from what I have seen, has a strong brand (though this is obviously a subjective factor). This idea is reinforced by the presence of their big name clients. Branding is really important in FinTech, businesses need 100% confidence when money and payments are involved. This offers not only stops entrants into their market, but should also facilitate future growth and customer acquisition.\n\n**Network Effect**\n\nImagine company A is on Payoneer and wants to pay company B. Company A suggests payment through their usual payment processor, Payoneer. Company B now signs up to Payoneer and decides to do all their payments through it etc. This is the network effect that Payoneer enjoys. This is a very powerful barrier to entry - very difficult to overcome, while also hard to create yourself.\n\n**Geographies**\n\nUNSUBSTANTIATED: Conversations on Reddit leads me to believe that Payoneer has a strong presence in Asia. If anyone has evidence, please put it in the comments.\n\nIf this is true, it should give Payoneer an edge in capitalising on the future growth of the emerging markets.\n\nSome evidence:\n\n* The CEO has gone on record saying Korea is one of their big market focuses.\n* Achieved triple digit growth each year in the asian markets from 2012-2016.\n\n**Valuation and Financials**\n\nAll numbers are based on original deal multiples (i.e based on when FTOC was $10 a share).\n\nEnterprise Value: $3.27 billion\n\nProjected 2021 revenue: $432 million\n\nEV/2021 revenue multiple: 7.6x\n\n2019-2020 revenue growth: 8.8%\n\nThis revenue growth is admittedly lower than one would desire for a FinTech company, and is often a criticism leveled against FTOC. However, considering the low EV/Revenue multiple (7.6x) compared to payment processing industry peers (36.5x), means the valuation more than compensates. Another FinTech going public through a SPAC, PaySafe, actually reported a 0.8% decrease in revenues from 2019-2020, but it recently hit $18 a share. (Nothing against PaySafe at all). Moreover, Payoneer\u2019s payment volume increased by 51% in the same timeframe, which will surely result in higher revenues in time. This should mean they reach their long-term target of yearly 20% revenue growth.\n\n**Institutional Ownership**\n\nPayoneer has some institutional giants already invested, including Wellington Management, Dragoneer Investment Group, Fidelity Management and Research, Temasek, and Franklin Templeton.\n\n**Speculative Catalyst**\n\nIn ARK\u2019s Big Ideas 2021, FinTech was mentioned as a big theme that will prevail in 2021. If ARK were to add this cheap, promising FinTech firm to one of their funds, Payoneer will get the respect it deserves and will rocket upwards.\n\n**Risks**\n\n* There are many entrants in the payment processing industry, potentially driving down fees and increasing competition for customers\n* Revenue did not increase very much during 2020, despite a huge e-commerce boom\n* Big clients (which could be a large percentage of revenues) may drop Payoneer for some (hypothetical) reason\n\n**Personal Note**\n\nI use Payoneer as a contractor for Appen. I like it, it always has good customer service, quick payouts and low fees compared to other providers.\n\n**Price Target**\n\nBull Case: $26\n\nMain Case: $21\n\nBear Case: $16\n\nHow did I get these numbers? Just educated guesses.\n\nAs always DYOR, I have linked the investor presentation in the sources, 100% worth a read.\n\n**Sources:**\n\nPosting sources that have been posted before gets this post taken down, so unfortunately I can't add them. If anyone wants them, send me a DM and I will reply with them (but bear in mind I live in the UK regarding time zones).\n\nEdit: Added risks, completely forgot about them (sorry).",

        "selftext": "I realize it's \"not good to time the market\", but I figure in case we correct after summer or whatever it may be smart to sell a little of my profits into cash. \n\nRight now I'm in about 100% equity besides my savings. I have about 30% portfolio in my IRA so I could go to cash in there pretty much whenever.\n\nIdeally I like to have 20% cash besides my 1 year emergency fund in my savings. It may be conservative but I get nervous on market downturns.\n\nMy \"cash like\" investments are MSFT and AAPL, which I kind of think of as either a bond or cash holding really.\n\nSo if I were to go to cash in my taxable I would be taxed at 0 on my long term gains. I would most likely trim my MSFT and or AAPL to about 5% each.  Right now combined they're about 20% of portfolio.\n\nI'm not sure now is a good time to trim them since I see at least MSFT maybe going higher this summer. But I feel pretty confident holding both. I feel that even if they did correct with the market they'd eventually at least get back to where they are now.\n\nBut what I'm wondering is that if and when I trim MSFT and or AAPL is it better to sell the long term shares, that for me are at 0,  or sell off the higher cost basis shares at short term gain and average down if there's a future correction? I'd be paying my income tax rate on short term shares though.\n\nI would think it would make more sense to trim the long term shares.  Fidelity let's you select what lots you sell.\n\nThanks.",

The criminal grabs the gun and shoots the good guy because they weren\u2019t expecting it. That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening with CLOV investors.\n\nThe vast majority of retail investors are letting their shares be borrowed by short-sellers using them to bet against you. Placing a high limit order does nothing. This is a widely repeated bit of misinformation. They can (and will) still loan out your shares, unless you specifically call your broker and tell them:\n\n1. DO NOT loan out my shares (i.e. place a \u201cLoan Exempt Restriction\u201d on your account); or\n2. Switch your account to a Cash Account (not Margin); or\n3. If you're using Robbinghood, Robinhood gold is automatically a margin account whether you use the margin or not (and most brokers won't let you buy CLOV on margin anyway). That\u2019s why you get hit with pattern day trade if you\u2019re below 25k). Downgrade from gold to a cash account. \\[Thank you Battosai21!\\]\n4. Open a new brokerage account with a broker who won\u2019t loan out your shares (Schwab, Fidelity), and then ask them to transfer your CLOV shares from whatever broker you\u2019re using (who does loan out your shares). Again, make sure your new broker won't loan out your shares.\n\nMost people think \u201cI only have a few hundred/few thousand shares so mine won\u2019t matter.\u201d When there are only few shares available to borrow, that makes a huge difference. If 1,000 people with 500 shares each call their broker and lock their shares, that\u2019s 500,000 borrowed shares already shorted that must be bought back immediately to close out the short position.\n\nTHAT, my friends, will prevent short-sellers from using your borrowed shares for ladder attacks against you. Don\u2019t think your small position doesn\u2019t matter. Everyone needs to stop your enemies from borrowing your ammunition to shoot at you. That\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re doing.",

        "selftext": "I'm a big believer in SSPK, but just want to spare people the agony if the PIPE release causes a terrible dislocation.  This has hit me in other deals and I just want to help people make informed decisions so they don't have to learn the lessons that I've learned first hand.  If we start to see weakness and bid hitting, consider breaking glass and either selling or hedging BEFORE the hedge funds\n\n **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:**  Weedmaps has a the dangerous combination of a) a PIPE that becomes unrestricted to short/hedge on June 15th, b) a PIPE that lacks long-only support, instead compromising of mostly arbs (best guess), and c) no strong evidence of strong stock sponsorship based on the recent 13Fs.  Given the narrow market for cannabis stocks, this combination could result in a significant drawdown after the SPAC close on June 15th, 2021.    \n\n **BACKGROUND:**  On June 15th, 2021, Weedmaps should close the de-SPAC of $SSPK into Weedmaps.  So what's important about this date?  The Closing date (capitalized \"C\") is a defined term in the PIPE subscription agreement.  Importantly, the PIPE investors are UNABLE to short or otherwise hedge the positions until the Close date.  As a practical matter, funds will likely wait until June 15th to trade.  Given the strong performance of the deal to date, this is a win.  Given how poorly the overall SPAC space has traded, these investors - especially the hedge fund arbitrageurs in the deal - could look to take the gains and move on.  What is crucial to understand when analyzing the potential technical selling impact of the PIPE on the close date:\n\n* Is there long only sponsorship of the stock?\n* *Are there buyers after the de-SPAC to support the stock and absorb any selling pressure?*\n* How large is the PIPE relative to the pro-forma free float?\n* *How much stock is coming for sale vs. the overall base?*\n* Are there any market indicators that tell us the PIPE wants to sell?\n* *A clue can be seen in the stock loan market*\n* How has the broader asset class been performing?\n* *Are arbs generally looking to de-risk where possible?*\n\nFirst, let's analyze the documents.  You can find the relevant terms disclosed in the 8K filed on the day of the deal announcement.    \n**PROHIBITION OF SHORTING/HEDGING UNTIL DEAL CLOSE:**  The PIPE subscription document includes an agreement between the PIPE investors and the SPAC, prohibiting hedging transactions until close \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7c3pc7qg5d571.png?width=758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a15e2272d605629967212a2f96d60caf3bcb4fef\n\n \n\n**PIPE COMPOSITION:**  Next, we want to see who is in the PIPE.  Importantly, we know strategics (while great), do not generally buy more stock in the aftermarket.  The same is true of hedge funds who are largely engaged in arbitrage.  Some hedge funds will take directional positions and grow them.  We see here that the BEST participants in the PIPE are basically \"meh.\"  Senvest is a good directional hedge fund, but does not have the infinite buying power that Fidelity has.  We can glean from this disclosure that the rest of the PIPE is likely hedge fund arbs.  These actors are highly likely to sell down / hedge at their soonest opportunity to lock in a profit.  It's important to note that the $325MM PIPE is large relative to the pro-forma float.  This amount of selling pressure, unless there is a lot of offsetting buying demand, could cause the stock to come under severe pressure\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xb5fb91j5d571.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7c701259428230a513964feb1f32f52b1adef26\n\n \n\nHOLDER BASE:  While we identified that the PIPE lacks holders who are likely to grow their positions post de-SPAC in meaningful ways, we want to see if investors have used the recent months to establish positions.  It's safe to say that Luxor was probably in the PIPE and they supplemented their position.  However, in what might be upwards of a $50MM position (including the PIPE), how much more support could they provide?  They are an exceptional hedge fund, but are they stronger than the selling pressure of the arbs?  Cannabis is a tricky industry for long-onlys and we really do not see the Blackrocks, Fidelity, T. Rowe's of the world that we would want to offset the likely PIPE selling pressure\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l2fgasql5d571.png?width=747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44d0417d541093d48271722f5b853b733d547073\n\n \n\n**MARKET INDICATORS:**  An important indicator is the short interest.  Even though the PIPE cannot short - they can secure borrow.  This means they can locate shares and borrow them (but cannot sell them).  Securing borrow is important if you are worried about having an ability to short.  From what I can see, it costs about 15% to borrow shares, which is a high rate.  This is indicative of a real need to secure shares for outright shorting and/or hedging purposes.  Once the deal closes, a PIPE holder who has located shares for borrow is able to sell those shares in the market.  The effect of this is to create an offsetting short position against their long PIPE shares.  PIPE shares cannot be sold until an effective S-1 is filed with the SEC, at which point the private PIPE shares become registered and freely tradable.  If you have a short position, you are able to cover your short simply by delivering your registered PIPE shares.  Voila - the investor is neutral in the exposure to Weedmaps\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wld94evn5d571.png?width=749&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22a237c49b102bde2de0054a18ad44621efd97b7\n\nGENERAL CONDITIONS:  How is the market doing?  Well, obviously, sPaCs ArE dEaD, as we all know....so funds are probably eager to take gains where they can.  What does this mean?  Let's look at a few recent de-SPACs to understand how severe the \"post close dump\" can be.    \n$ASTS had a very similar set-up to $SSPK (PIPE couldn't short, no long-only support, small trust size, etc).  The day after close, the stock was unrelentingly sold\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bk8dnqwq5d571.png?width=749&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbfbad5e165fe3046ad7d404ef3c6e888420d4a2",

        "selftext": "I wanted to post this in case anyone is researching the Moomoo app later before they consider opening a brokerage account on it and depositing money. Hopefully this will come up on a search and they'll be able to read about my experience, because not much comes up searching this app now. It's very frustrating to open a brokerage account and deposit money only to discover the app does not provide the services it advertises and claims to do. It turns into a mistake that takes almost one month to correct and get out of and get your money back. You're looking at 5 business days for an ACH deposit to clear. If you want to withdraw, that deposit has to sit in the account another 5 business days (plus a 3 day settlement time if you bought and sold stocks). Another 5 business days for the ACH withdrawal to clear and hit your bank account. And finally another 5 business days to deposit the funds and clear into a new brokerage account. \r\n\r\nTldr - there's an imgur link in the comments to screenshots of the customer service chat and my options Level. \n\r\n\t1. Orders do not execute properly, explained below. Notifications for orders don't always work, even though the slightest move for anything in your watch list sends multiple notifications. \r\n\t\r\n\t2. They have no phone number available for customer service. Only chat or email with very inexperienced reps and takes a while to get a response on. \r\n\t- Update on this, I actually talked to someone at Finra and found out brokerage firms are not required to have working phone number available for clients or customer service, which is frankly ridiculous IMO. Someone told me RH doesn't have a phone # either but I don't trade with them for other reasons so can't confirm that. If the internet or app or whatever goes down, or you have a problem difficult to explain via chat/email, you're just stuck. Can't call anyone or access your account in any way.\r\n\t\r\n\t3. Can't trade options even though they advertise you can and my account was set to Level 4 for options trading, explained more below. Customer service literally told me their system does not support covered calls. They claim to only support long calls or puts but I never could place those trades either. Definitely can't trade any advanced strategy either, spreads, strangles, etc. and I had nothing on margin even though I don't think that should matter for those trades. \r\n\t\r\n\t4. No desktop option or interface.\r\n\t\r\r\n\t5. Their PDT system doesn't appear to work correctly, never counts or recognized day trades, but that may be a plus for some folks.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe Moomoo app is part of Futu which is appears to be an established, reputable, and successful large company. I recently signed up for an account because I really like their UI and the way it's easy to navigate through the stock data, especially the options chains, and you can change the name of the stock shown in the watch list, where I add my basis, which is very handy when selling covered calls and that basis is constantly changing. So as far as using the app for a watch list, that's the only thing I recommend and will continue to do.\r\n\r\n\t1. Orders do not execute properly. I purchased XX shares of AMC a few weeks ago. I set a stop limit order on Friday, May 28, and have modified it several times to increase the stop and limit prices. The last time I changed it was around closing on Wednesday, June 2, when I increased the stop to 55.50 and limit to 55. Luckily I checked it around 6pm the same day, and I saw the order executed at 5:39pm for 65.36. I did Not get a notification for the trade. I checked the charts on Moomoo, Schwab desktop program, Fidelity, and by tick on Webull, and never see it drop anywhere close to 55.50. I bought back soon after I so I still have my position. But the point is, it shouldn't have executed. Screenshots on imgur link. Please note the time stamps in those are CDT times and the times I reference here are EDT. \r\n\t\ta. First, I've had accounts with several brokers and have never seen stops trigger after hours. In fact the order instructions on all of those other brokerages stated their stop-loss and stop limit orders would not apply to or be placed during after hours. I could be wrong on that, if anyone has experience otherwise, please let me know. That's actually a feature that I wish was offered. \r\n\t\tb. When I talked to customer service they didn't even understand what a stop limit was. First, the rep told me I placed two separate orders. Then they told me the stop price of 55.50 was hit at 2:11 pm and the order didn't execute until 5:39pm because I \"had to wait in line behind all of the other orders that were placed before\" mine. On AMC, when the volume that day was through the roof, over 760 million. Obviously I wouldn't, definitely shouldn't, have had to wait hours for a limit sell order under the market price to fill. Plus, the stop wasn't set to 55.50 at 2:11pm, it was at 50.50 And I didn't change it to 55.50 until right before 4:00pm.\r\n\t\tc. I waited hours to speak to a supervisor, and never did, but finally got an email from someone after 3pm the next day. The email included a screenshot of the order book that supposedly shows a sell of 506 shares for 54.54 at 17:39:16.\r\n\t\t\ti. Note the previous transaction was for 65.36. The 54.54 transaction is red with a down arrow, as is the following transaction for 65.35, even though that's an increase from 54.54.\r\n\t\t\tii. Also note, while my sell order filled at 65.36 at 17:39:17 (verified in his email and my trade confirmation), there is no transaction for that amount at that time. The last trade for 65.36 was at 17:39:15. So did my more execute before the supposed 54.54 transaction or did it execute for 65.38, 2 cents more, but I only received 65.36?\r\n\t\t\tiii. This transaction is marked with a \"U\" while every other one is marked with an \"I\". I'm not sure of the meaning or significance of this letter code. If anyone knows, I'd appreciate the insight. \r\n\t\td. Like I mentioned, notifications for order execution don't always work, even though the slightest move for anything in your watch list sends multiple notifications. Get bombarded by those and don't have many options to limit them to the ones you really do want to see.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t2. You can only speak to them through chat or email and they refuse to give a phone number. And they give different customer service email addresses. \r\n\t\r\n\t3. Can't trade options even though they advertise you can. I wasn't aware of any broker that does not allow covered calls. Customer service told me I could trade long calls and long puts, but the app would never allow the order to to be placed, always giving me an error. \r\n\t\tUpdate: After I originally posted this I looked at my account and saw that Moomoo had my Options Level set to Level 4. Yes that's a 4, not a 3. I've never had an account above a 3, and honestly didn't know what Level 4 was or that it existed. According to their definitions, Level 4 has all the permissions/trading ability as Level 3, plus it allows selling uncovered calls and naked puts. Here it is copied straight from the site. \r\n\t\t\tYour option level:  Level 4\r\n\t\t\t\tBuying calls\r\n\t\t\t\tBuying puts\r\n\t\t\t\tCombinations (Coming Soon)\r\n\t\t\t\tSelling uncovered puts\r\n\t\t\t\tSelling uncovered calls\r\n\t\r\n\t\tOf course the last two on the list are trades I would never make, selling naked calls or puts, as those have got to be arguably the riskiest types of trades. But I tried to put in an order anyway to test it for a very cheap option on a very cheap stock, and of course it didn't work. And, I still can't even sell covered calls or buy calls or puts. Go figure. \r\n\t\r\n\t4. No desktop option or interface. Self explanatory \r\r\n\t\r\n\t5. PDT - not entirely confirmed, but on the plus side for some people maybe, their PDT count system doesn't appear work either. The system always showed me with 3,3,3,3,3 even after one instance where I sold, bought, sold, bought, sold, bought the same stock in one day.  \r\n\t\ta. I monitored this for several days ago and the counts never changed. Not sure if maybe that's because a couple of those trades were executed in extended hours. I need to learn how the PDT requirements apply to trades executed pre and post market hours. Still, the bought, sold, bought, was during normal hours. The first sell was pre and the last sell and buy were after hours. But all on the same day, it should've at least has one marked off and gone to 2,3,3,3,3.\r\n\t\tb. I still never made 4 day trades in 5 days out of fear that it would start working or was working and their system was incorrectly reporting the count in the app.\r\n\r\nThat's the gist of it. Sorry for the long post but I hope this helps someone in the future. Happy to answer any questions or hear any explanations as to whether there are legitimate reasons for why I encountered some of these issues.",

Does anyone have a ranking or reference that compares the top options and pros/cons of each to know what I can get with subscriptions beyond what I already have?\n\nIMHO, ThinkorSwim relies on a lot of experitise that only comes from years of practice and there is no real training manual or anything to help.  Etrade Pro is great for real time momentum or day trading but is rather limited in doing research.  Fidelity Pro is good for limited trading and is mostly geared towards investing but is their offerring to day traders, but it does have some built in AI to do basic things.",

        "selftext": "I have been trading stocks for 7 years but have only been trading options for 5 months. From what I can decipher, I feel like yesterday I entered into a position that \u201cliterally cannot go tits up\u201d (RIP OG WSB). From what I have observed, this sub offers excellent insight and I believe I could learn something from your opinions on my positions.\n\nYesterday I sold AMC 65c 7/16 for $12.10/share and simultaneously sold AMC 44p 7/16 for $7.55/share. Immediately afterwards I entered a 100 share long position for AMC at $56.70 and a -100 share short position for $56.40 (ate the spread). I took these (almost) net-neutral positions because it reduces the margin impact of my trades (How come? Idk ask Fidelity). [Note: all positions are per-unitized to a 100-share basis to make the math easier]\n\nHere is my conundrum: the following AMC price points are important to my position: $84.65, $77.10, $65.00, $44.00, $36.45, and $24.35. \nFrom what I understand, if the price of AMC stays between $44 and $65, I\u2019ll be able to capture the $1965 in premium minus $35 from closing my near-neutral long-short position minus the spread at that time.\nIf the price of AMC increases beyond $77.10 or I get assigned beyond $65, I plan to close all positions. If the price decreases below $36.45 or I get assigned at $44, I plan on closing all positions. Closing at $77.10, I stand to make $720 minus the cost of closing my puts+unassigned calls minus the spread of closing my long-short position. Closing at $36.45, I stand to make $1175 minus the cost of closing my calls+unassigned puts minus the spread.\n$84.65 and $24.35 guarantee losses on my positions, hence why I plan on closing at $77.10 or $36.45 regardless of what happens.\n\nI think(?) the only way I get screwed on this position is if the price cranks to $77.10 or to $36.45 very quickly in the next week or so and my options are costly to close out because of high IV. If it doesn\u2019t, then I profit off of theta decay and ride a $1930 gain per $10,900 in posted collateral over a &lt;4 week period.\n\nThis kind of projected profit off such a wide price range feels too good to be true. I feel like I am being naive and I would like to know how this trade could screw me. Thank you.\n\n\n\nSide note: 5 years on Reddit and this is my first time posting\u2026\n\nBackground: 7 yrs stock trading; 5.5 years algorithmic trading; 4.5 years crypto trading; 5 months options \u201ctrading\u201d\n\nI started trading options 5 months ago by selling covered SPY calls and cash covered SPY puts leveraging a sizable portion of my portfolio. Selling covered calls at a 2:1 rate to cash covered puts. Currently yielding an annualized rate of 4.9% on the summation of my equity and cash assets. It\u2019s not much compared to other strategies but it feels better than outright buying more SPY, QQQ, VTI, etc. at the moment. This post is the first time I have ever felt like I was entering a high risk options trade.",

        "selftext": "While bulls continue to lead the markets forward, investor focus will likely shift to macro indicators, such as interest rates and inflation, as the Federal Reserve begins its two-day meeting this week.\n\nAlthough the central bank is unlikely to make any moves on rates, it could provide some insights into how it sees the economic rebound progressing and whether the need to remove some monetary stimulus has indeed arrived.  \n\nSo far, stocks investors don\u2019t see any danger to their favorable views on the market. The S&amp;P 500 finished on Friday at a new high, posting a 0.4% gain for the week. Keeping this macro picture in mind, following are three stocks we'll be monitoring in the coming week.\n\n1. Oracle\nOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) will release its fiscal 2021, fourth-quarter earnings report on Tuesday, June 15, after the market close. Analysts are projecting $1.31 a share profit on sales of $11.02 billion.\n\nThe shares of the software company are surging this year on improving demand for the tech giant\u2019s cloud computing services after years of stagnant sales. Its stock closed on Friday at $82.90 after climbing 28% this year, more than three times the return produced by the benchmark NASDAQ 100 Index.\n\n\nGrowth prospects are improving as the company focuses on cloud computing services in an effort to accelerate revenue growth at the world\u2019s second-largest software maker. Customer interest in the firm\u2019s internet-based applications has finally offset declining demand for its legacy tools.\n\n\n2. Adobe Systems\nAnother stock that will come under investor scrutiny this coming week is Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE). The software manufacturer, whose product lineup includes Photoshop, will release its fiscal 2021, second quarter earnings on Thursday, June 17 after the close. Wall Street expects $2.81 EPS and $3.73 billion of revenue.\n\n\nAdobe\u2019s earnings during the pandemic showed that the software maker\u2019s cloud-based creative tools are in great demand. Chief Executive Officer Shantanu Narayen has offered new creative software tools to clients to accelerate Adobe\u2019s revenue growth. \n\nIn March, the company raised its 2021 fiscal year revenue forecast to $15.45 billion from $15.15 billion and said sales in its main digital media segment would increase 22% after earlier projecting 19% growth. Adjusted earnings will be about $11.85 a share, an increase from $11.20 previously forecast.\n\nThe company introduced a version of its popular app\u2014Illustrator\u2014for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad, back in October, as part of an effort to expand its products' footprint to include more devices used by professionals and hobbyists.\n\nConsumers of Document Cloud products\u2014including Adobe Acrobat PDF and electronic signature software\u2014have surged with millions working from home.  Adobe shares closed on Friday at $541.26 after rising 8% this year.\n\n3. Kroger\nSupermarket behemoth, Kroger Company (NYSE:KR) will report its Q1, 2021 earnings on Thursday before the market opens. Analysts are expecting $0.98 a share profit on sales of $39.56 billion.\n\nKroger's stock has gained 22% this year on the grocer\u2019s surging sales and its participation in the U.S. vaccination campaign against COVID-19. The company is delivering millions of vaccinations to people nationwide, creating more repeat customers for its pharmacies and supermarket offerings. Kroger generated record sales of $132.5 billion in the year ended Jan. 30.\n\nKroger is betting that its in-store pharmacies and clinics can keep its supermarkets central to consumers\u2019 lives even as the coronavirus recedes. Next week\u2019s earnings could provide some insight to investors regarding the path it intends to take once the pandemic is contained.\n\n\u201cCOVID has taught us that pharmacy is always really important and will be important as we go forward,\u201d Rodney McMullen, Kroger\u2019s chief executive, told WSJ.com in March.",

Officials are particularly concerned about apps that collect users' persona data or have connections to Chinese military or intelligence activities.\n\nThe department also will make recommendations on how to further protect Americans' genetic and personal health information, and will address the risks of certain software apps connected to China or other adversaries, according to senior administration officials.\n\nThe Biden administration's move reflects the ongoing concern that Americans\u2019 personal data could be exposed by popular apps tied to China, a chief U.S. economic and political rival. The White House and Congress have both taken action to address Beijing\u2019s technological advancement. On Tuesday, the Senate passed a bill that aims to boost U.S. semiconductor production and the development of artificial intelligence and other technology in the face of growing international competition.\n\nThe administration earlier this year had backed off President Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to ban the popular video app TikTok, asking a court to postpone a legal dispute as the government began a broader review of the national security threats posed by Chinese technology companies.\n\nA court filing said the Commerce Department was reviewing whether Trump\u2019s claims about TikTok\u2019s threat to national security justified the attempts to ban it from smartphone app stores and deny it vital technical services. An update to the review was due in a court case later this week.\n\nAlso in limbo has been a proposed U.S. takeover of TikTok. Last year, the Trump administration brokered a deal that would have had U.S. corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in the Chinese-owned app on national security grounds.\n\nThe unusual arrangement stemmed from a Trump executive order that aimed to ban TikTok in the U.S. unless it accepted a greater degree of American control.\n\nTrump targeted TikTok over the summer of 2020 with a series of orders that cited concerns over the U.S. data that TikTok collects from its users. Courts temporarily blocked the White House\u2019s attempted ban, and the presidential election soon overshadowed the TikTok fight.\n\nTikTok has been looking to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review Trump\u2019s divestment order and the government\u2019s national security review.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nO'Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island, and Arbel from New York.",

        "selftext": "\nLOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June 14, 2021 / Cinedigm (NASDAQ: $CIDM), the leading independent streaming entertainment company super-serving enthusiast fan bases, announced today that it has finalized the acquisition of FoundationTV. Founded in 2013 by a team of computer and data scientists from Apple, Oracle, NEC, and Yahoo, FoundationTV is a comprehensive video streaming technology, artificial intelligence, machine-learning, and data analytics platform provider. Based in India, the Company co-developed the Matchpoint technology platform that currently powers Cinedigm's portfolio of streaming channels and digital video distribution business.\n\n\nWith this acquisition, Cinedigm has integrated FoundationTV's underlying technology portfolio with the Matchpoint digital distribution platform along with their respective software engineering team into a new Indian-based division, Cinedigm India. The new division will serve as the Company's engineering, research and development hub focused on next-generation video streaming technology and emerging technologies such as cryptocurrencies and NFT. As part of the acquisition, FoundationTV's engineering team will join Cinedigm and will be responsible for further developing and extending the combined platform's state-of-the-art capabilities and next-generation roadmap.\n\nIn addition to enhancing and supplementing Cinedigm's technical prowess in OTT and digital distribution, the Cinedigm India team will begin architecting and developing the underlying technology for a global \"umbrella\" service that will allow Cinedigm to showcase its portfolio of more than 20 streaming channels and more than 15,000 hours of AVOD, SVOD &amp; TVOD video content. The Company plans to enable subscriptions individually, as well as offer bundled pricing for various Cinedigm services. It will offer subscriptions for purchase directly from Cinedigm, via all major App Stores across the streaming ecosystem worldwide, and through major video distribution partners around the globe.\n\nThe fully integrated platform will also be used to power and expand the Company's existing portfolio of streaming services while consolidating Cinedigm's recent acquisitions like The Film Detective, Fandor and Screambox into one unified platform. Matching the engineering capabilities of Netflix, Hulu and others, FoundationTV's flagship streaming platform is built to withstand a massive scale of up to 100 billion streaming events per day.\n\n\"This deal marks the beginning of Cinedigm's global expansion with the entrance into the world's fastest growing streaming market,\" said Erick Opeka, Chief Strategy Officer and President of Cinedigm Networks. \"Not only will we have a world-class engineering hub, we will also have an incredibly experienced team of professionals with deep, intrinsic market knowledge that will accelerate the growth of our streaming initiatives.\"\n\n\"Through this partnership, we are thrilled to integrate our intelligence driven cloud-native streaming technology platform into Cinedigm's growing streaming business,\" said Samrat Ganguly, Founder of FoundationTV. \"There's a strong need for content in the booming Southeast Asian market and the technology will allow Cinedigm to expand their global streaming footprint to a new enthusiastic audience.\"\n\nCinedigm India will also be tasked with leveraging Cinedigm's current roster of streaming channels and content to build new experiences for the entire South Asian market, the second largest in the world with an estimated 800 million streaming users monthly. As part of the acquisition, two founders of FoundationTV, Sudipta Ghorui and Sudeept Bhatnagar, will assume leadership roles and jointly oversee the Cinedigm India operations.\n\nThe FoundationTV transaction is expected to be accretive to Cinedigm's earnings within the first twelve months due to associated cost savings associated with Indian operations, additional cost improvements related to the combination of Matchpoint and FoundationTV, revenues associated with 3rd party commercial licensing of the technology and distribution revenues from the exploitation of Cinedigm's streaming channels and content in the southeast Asian market.",
