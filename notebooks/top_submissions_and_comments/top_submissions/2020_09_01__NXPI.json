        "selftext": "This confirms months of speculation...here are the initial thoughts from analysts.\n\n**Needham** \\- \"Will It Be Game Changing? We Shall See.\"\n\n\"We believe the acquisition represents a big risk but with potential huge awards. From a financial perspective, this acquisition is the largest deal in NVIDIA's history. We are not concerned about the size of the deal because NVIDIA generated $4.3BN of free cash flow in FY20 and is on track to generate $5.2BN in FY21, and hence we expect it to make up the $12BN in cash fairly quickly, even without a contribution from Arm. Additionally, the dilution represents only 7% of total shares - not a major event, in our view.\"\n\n\"Strategically, we believe there are several advantages: in the near-term, Arm IP is ubiquitous in the mobile phone and tablet markets with 95% share. NVDA can harvest that steady cash flow stream to finance growth. ARM has a cumulative number of licenses signed of 1,767 as of F4Q19 and 22.8 billion royalty units as reported by licensee. Longer-term, Arm is gaining inroads in the all the major secular growth drivers in technology including cloud and infrastructure equipment, edge IoT, robotics and self-driving vehicles. Arm technology is being used in advanced MCUs for IoT devices such as communication chips and sensors and broad range of networking equipment.\"\n\n\"On the skeptical side of the equation, we wonder about the anti-trust factors as Arm is the \"Arms-dealer\" in the semiconductor industry with a long list of customers, which include competitors, such as TI, MRVL, AMD, IFX, QCOM, AAPL, Samsung, NXPI, AVGO and others. We also need to have a better understanding of the long-term revenue ramp and overall TAM. Arm's net sales have been lackluster for the past two fiscal years, growing 3% in FY19 and declining in FY18 due to deterioration in overall business conditions in the semiconductor industry.\"\n\n**Jefferies**\u00a0\\- \"NVDA + ARM = $50 EPS Power in 2025\"\n\n\" We view the deal as transformative, positioning NVDA not just to capture 80% of the ecosystem value in the data center, but also unify the compute ecosystem between the edge and data center. We think the merged company has a 5-yr EPS power of $50, and increase our price target to $680, and bull-case to $1,000.\"\n\n\"We estimate the deal to be slightly accretive the first year after close.\"\n\n\"Transformative Deal - Heterogeneous Data Center Scale Solution Provider: In previous computing eras, one ecosystem typically controlled 80% of the profits of the ecosystem \u2013 in PCs it was Wintel, in Smartphones it is Apple. Due to the ecosystem it has created in Acceleration (processor, interconnect (MLNX), software stack including CUDA and vertical market software), we\u2019ve argued that Nvidia was best positioned to capture 80% of the profits of the Parallel Processing Era. However, with ARM, we think Nvidia is poised to also offer general purpose, heterogeneous data center scale solutions and ultimately capture up to 80% of the value of the serial processing part of the data center ecosystem as well. We also think that ARM gives it a larger moat in the data center.\"\n\n\"Transformative Deal - Unifying the Edge with the Data Center: the Cell Phone / Server Computing Era was the first where compute bifurcated, and two separate ecosystems operated in parallel (Apple\u2019s ecosystem in the Smartphone, and Wintel in the data center). Should Nvidia successfully acquire ARM, then the compute ecosystem will be unified from edge to data center, and we would expect Nvidia to offer more highly integrated compute solutions across the entire compute ecosystem, and realize the lion\u2019s share of the profits in this 4th Tectonic Shift in Computing.\"\n\n\"Five-year EPS Power of $50. We believe this is a differentiated interpretation of NVidia's earnings potential which stems from our view that Nvidia is supplying an ecosystem in the data center, much like Apple supplies to the smart phone market, or Intel and Microsoft did in PCs. In contrast to other traditional semiconductor competitors, Nvidia's ecosystem extends beyond processors, to high speed interconnect (MLNX) and a software stack. During the PC Era, Microsoft's PC operating profit was similar to Intel's, and we think Nvidia's earnings potential framework should be modeled more like Wintel, with half of its earnings power coming from the ecosystem that it created. We model Nvidia Data Center processor revenues of $34bn in 2025, and Data Center Ecosystem (software) of an additional $34bn.\"\n\n**RBC -** \"We continue to believe the same three major points: 1) biggest hurdle in our view is approval/official closing of transaction; 2) if the transaction closes, we think this would be a notable negative for Intel and a notable positive for Nvidia; and 3) with Apple, Amazon, and now Nvidia, a robust software ecosystem is ready to support an ARM-based server environment over the long term.\"\n\n\" What do Apple and Nvidia have in common? Access to successful software ecosystems. Since x86 has been the dominant player in the server market, Nvidia could argue that the transaction would create more competition against the x86 market. Currently, the market is largely Intel \\~85\u201390% (x86) and AMD 8\u201310% (x86) and a few points \u201cOther\u201d depending on how one defines the total market. If Nvidia puts research and development dollars behind the transaction, an ecosystem to compete against x86 would be possible, in our view, given Nvidia\u2019s success with CUDA. Finally, AWS has a new Graviton product based on ARM architecture. It is arguably a stable/solid alternative given its lower power consumption. We\u2019ve seen this story twice in the past in the Flops/Watt (GPU&gt;CPU) and TCO (AMD&gt;INTC\"\n\n**Raymond James** \\- \" As we had suspected earlier, much of the justification for the deal in the presentation centers on the datacenter market. Based on our initial read of the presentation, we view this as an assault on Intel\u2019s server CPU business. The intention would seem to be to become able to offer server customers a broader roadmap that covers both CPU, GPU and server. It\u2019s yet unclear however about how a NVDA datacenter business that would offer server CPUs benefit from NVDA owning ARM as opposed to simply being a licensee. Nonetheless, we do view this as a move on NVDA\u2019s part to compete more fully with both INTC and AMD in the server pace. MRVL is also an ARM licensee for server CPUs, but since MRVL has already announced that they would only pursue custom server CPU engagements going forward, we don\u2019t expect much impact to MRVL. Undoubtedly, the combination of ARM\u2019s leading processor IP with NVDA\u2019s GPU and AI IP will create a powerful combination. But it\u2019s not immediately clear how NVDA intends to leverage having ARM under their own ownership, and will expect that vision to be part of the company\u2019s presentation.\n\n\"The presentation notes that NVDA intends to continue ARM\u2019s open licensing model and NVDA IP would also be added to ARM\u2019s licensing business. That could certainly become additive to the revenue for the total licensing business, but more details will need to be provided to understand the potential revenue synergies.\"\n\n\"The transaction requires regulatory approval the U.K., China, the European Union and the United States. China approval will naturally be viewed as a risk given US/China trade tensions. Since ARM IP is the foundation of nearly all handsets and IOT devices, we would expect the deal to be highly scrutinized, and we would expect that NVDA would need to provide assurances that it will continue an open licensing model. NVDA is an ARM licensee, but ARM processors is a small part of NVDA\u2019s business, limited to the automotive business (3% of revenue) and the Nintendo Switch custom processor (4% of revenue, by our estimates). Therefore, since there is a very small part of revenue in which NVDA competes with ARM licensees, we don\u2019t expect that to raise significant regulatory concerns.\"",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, Sept 16, 2020**\n\nStocks opened high but erased their gains and turned mixed as investors digested the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s (FOMC) September monetary policy statements and remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The Fed signaled that interest rates would remain at near-zero through 2023 in an attempt to buoy the virus-stricken economy.\n\nIn their report, the FOMC once again reiterated that \u2018the path of economic recovery will depend significantly on the course of the virus \\[coronavirus\\]\u201d. They said, \u201cThe ongoing public health crisis will continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term\u201d.\n\nOn a positive note, the Fed\u2019s outlook for economic contraction was less dire compared to previous months, suggesting a rising level of optimism in the Fed\u2019s projections. The Fed forecast a 3.7% contraction in real GDP and an unemployment rate of 7.6% by the end of the year, versus its June outlook for a 6.5% GDP contraction and jobless rate of 9.3%. The Fed also added that it would continue its current Treasury and mortgage-backed securities purchases \u201cat least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions.\u201d\n\nOnce again, in his statements Powell urged lawmakers to pass more fiscal stimulus to provide direct support to small businesses and households, stating that the initial faster-than-expected economic recovery could be threatened with the enhanced unemployment numbers as direct support measures expire. Both Powell and other FOMC members have repeatedly underscored the importance of both robust monetary and fiscal policy to economic recovery. Powell said\u201d \u201cThe people who worked in those service jobs, particularly the entry-level, lower-paid workers, they're the ones who are most vulnerable. And those are the ones who we really need to look out for both through Fed policy, which will be there to support the economy \u2014 but also through fiscal policy \\[provided by congressional lawmakers\\]\u201d.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Facebook (FB) finished the day 3.24% down after it was announced that Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will file an antitrust lawsuit against the company and that Kim Kardashian will boycott FB and IG as a protest to their mishandling of info.\n* General Electric (GE) stock spiked 11% after it was announced the company would have positive free cash flow by end of 2020.\n* Snowflake (SNOW) went public today in style, with the stock price more than tripling compared to $120 pricing the stock was listed at, becoming one of the most expensive stocks in the market. For context, the stock is valued at about a third of the market cap of Oracle (ORCL), which this year should have about 70 times as much revenue as Snowflake. Microsoft (MSFT) right now has a market cap of $1.6 trillion, about 10 times current year estimated revenues. Were it valued like Snowflake, it would be worth $17 trillion,\n* Shares of Spotify (SPOT) fell as much as 7% after Apple (AAPL) announced a bundled plan for all its services that lowered the cost of Apple Music subscriptions.\n* Inovio (INO) has been on an absolute tear recently, with the stock price up 35% today (77% up in the week).\n* Pacific Ethanol (PEIX): HC Wainwright lifted the price target from $3 to $16 that\u2019s over 400%!\n* NXP Semiconductors (NXPI): Needham lifted price target from $140 to $150. stock is currently at $130\n* Paycom (PAYC): initiated by Cowen at $325 OUTPERFORM. The stock is currently $280, so very bullish.\n* Overstock (OSTK): Credit Suisse Group initiated coverage at $91 price target and OUTPERFORM. Stock is currently at $73, so very bullish.\n* Gamestop (GME) had nice run up 22% for the day\n* Digital Turbine (APPS) has been on a tear up 12% and over 200% in last 3 months.\n* Oracle's (ORCL) TikTok bid apparently leaves US security concerns unaddressed.",

        "selftext": "(no promotional content, no affiliate links)\n\nHi,\n\nexactly four years ago, I started copying eToro investors / traders that I selected using the broker's built-in search engine (profitable in last two years, already being copied by others), followed by manual filtering, to take into account fluctuations in yearly returns, composition of their portfolios etc. With that, I got a list of 10 people whom I started to copy on a demo account:\n\n[https://www.investing-scientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/etoro\\_1.jpg](https://www.investing-scientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/etoro_1.jpg)\n\nIn the screenshot you can see that in case of the first two of them the amount invested was $10,000, while for the rest it was just $100. This is because I started copying the first two a couple of weeks earlier; eventually I changed this into $100 the same day I made the screenshot and this is when my calculations start - so this thing is irrelevant,  I just cannot travel in time to make another screenshot.\n\nWhat I did after that?\n\nWell, within the next six weeks my profits oscillated between -$11 and +$9.50 (the biggest profit was on Nov 9, a day after US presidential elections). I found this \"boring\" and discontinued experimenting with copy trading.\n\nToday I looked back at those ten traders. Here is what I found. Firstly, seven of them are not with eToro anymore; investorNo1, Simple-Stock-Mkt, tradingrelax, 4exPirate, primit, Gallojack, xjurokx. The other three traders are:\n\n* toppertrader: not being copied by anyone and for a good reason: his loss this year alone is 61.16%!\n* Jean-marcLenfant: copied by only 67 people; his loss this year is -1.09% but in general he is quite successful, with yearly profits ranging from 3.57% to 7.32%.\n* Girem2: he has no copiers, his profit this year is 41.45% but in 2018 he experienced a loss of 83.15%!\n\nMy observations and thoughts are as follows:\n\n1. Seven out of ten traders are not with eToro anymore, which makes me wonder why. I have no proof but my guess is they simply performed poorly, lost their copiers and closed their accounts. This is already alarming but what if they opened another account? Or, even worse, multiple accounts? They could be investing small money and try different risky approaches, hoping that at least one account will turn out profitable in the long turn, attracting potential copiers. (I'm not claiming that those 7 particular traders did this, it's just my general suspicion regarding some of eToro traders)\n2. I'm unable to calculate what would be my profit if I never stopped copying them, because I cannot check at what day and with what profit those seven traders left eToro. I'm guessing this would be an immense loss. On the other hand, considering the three traders who are still with eToro, I would **lose more than a quarter** of my assets!\n\nWhat now?\n\nI must be a quite adventurous person or at least an incorrigible optimist, because a month ago (exactly on Aug 26th) I started copying three traders with real money. Here is who they are.\n\n[rubymza](https://www.etoro.com/portfolio/rubymza) (Heloise Greeff)\n\n* invests in stocks, with GOOG, INTC, BLDP, MA, MSFT, AMZN, V, MU, IBM and NXPI making up 50.3% of her portfolio (allocation of each of them is in between 3.02% and 6.85%)\n* active since 2016 (only the year 2016 ended with a loss)\n* has 3044 copiers and $2M-$5M of copy assets under management\n* **strategy (her own words)**: \"My investing strategy focusses mostly on US indices, tech and pharma, promising future (5-10years) growth. My trades are based on technical analysis using machine learning to understand patterns and trends in the markets. I prefer to keep a diverse portfolio to spread risk while achieving great returns.\"\n* she [gave an interview for Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-12/six-things-you-re-doing-wrong-when-buying-stocks-on-your-own) a couple of weeks ago\n* own experience: I just happened to run across her second worst month ever on eToro; my loss is **-6.27%** at the time of writing\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[OlivierDanvel](https://www.etoro.com/portfolio/olivierdanvel) (Olivier Jean Andre Danvel)\n\n* he is a Forex trader, making typically 21 trades per week; his favorite currency pairs are EURCHF (12% of trades), CADCHF and GBPUSD; the trades, however, typically make up below 5% of his portfolio (at least whenever I'm checking it), making most of my funds unused\n* active since January 2017: surprisingly enough, he has every single month profitable, though monthly profits are in the range of 0.03% to 3.34% only\n* has 8977 copiers and more than $5M of copy assets under management\n* **strategy (his own words)**: \"I monitor currency pairs all day to find the best entry. There is some management/scaling position for perfect entry. The risk control is a big part of my strategy,\" (quite vague, to be honest)\n* own experience: my current profit is **0.26%**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[rayvahey](https://www.etoro.com/portfolio/rayvahey) (Raymond Noel Vahey)\n\n* commodities compose 76% of his portfolio and his favorite assets are Gold and Oil (at the moment, Gold makes up half of invested amount)\n* active since July 2016, with the following  yearly profits, starting from 2016: 6.56%, 10.05%, 13.09%, 32.26% and -2.03% (the current year)\n* has 1493 copiers and $1M-$2M of copy assets under management\n* **strategy (his own words)**: \"My system is based on patterns, and a variety of technical analysis tools and some fundamental analysis. I primarily trade in commodities. \" (quite vague as well)\n* own experience: my profit with rayvahey is **2.56%**\n\nWhat was my strategy to hand-pick these particular traders? First I did some basic scanning using eToro's built-in search engine. The most important filter was that the trader was profitable within the last two years: unfortunately, eToro does not allow to reach details of earlier performance automatically. To know how the trader performed before 2019, I had to look at stats in the profile of each of them. I was also taking into account how often they trade (to avoid those who do only a couple of trades yearly), whether they were trading recently and whether they write posts regularly in their feed. With this, I got a list of fifteen candidates to copy:\n\n* olivierdanvel\n* marianopardo\n* rubymza\n* rayvahey\n* martidg97\n* overit\n* misterg23\n* knw500\n* jianswang\n* reinhardtcoetzee\n* miyoshi\n* alderique\n* jarodd76\n* benson9904\n* big-profits\n\nAs you already know, I finally chose three of them. Rubymza seemed to be the most trustworthy stock trader, based on profits, posts feed and regular trading, among other things.  Regarding OlivierDanvel, his uniqueness is the ability to record continuous profits with the Forex market. Finally, with rayvahey I wanted to increase my exposure to the commodities market.\n\nWish me good luck!\n\n*Michael*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S.\n\nYou might find those copy-trading related readings interesting:\n\n* https://www.etoro.com/copytrader/\n* https://www.investopedia.com/etoro-review-5072808\n* https://socialtradingvlog.com/\n* https://stockupwithjoe.com/etoro-copy-trader/\n* https://blockonomi.com/etoro-copy-trading-guide/\n* https://www.quora.com/Does-copying-best-traders-concept-of-etoro-really-work\n* https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-get-rich-by-copying-the-trades-of-top-traders-in-eToro-Zulu-trade/answer/Lutz-Enke\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Disclosures**:\n\n* What you see here is my personal opinion, my own investments and should not be treated as investing advice\n* I\u2019m an amateur investor",
