Remember IV can be your friend just as fast as it's your enemy.\n \n2  Second, Tech AND tech equipment stocks are booming because everything is online currently.\nExplanation: Gold rush analogy.\nIn the trade of selling the picks, shovels and axes to the gold miners only 2-3% of them make it big after hacking away at the mountain, while the guys selling the tools make a ton of money. They sell the equipment to actually use their platforms. So basically whenever someone bought something online there was a device they had to buy first to gain access to the sites.\n\n3  Third, you can play the runup or actually play the earnings.(Imo both \nshould be good for stock price)\nExplanation: Anticipation  \n            If you're skeptical of holding through earnings just sell before and play IV and runup\n            The only reason I don't see them having a runup is if the entire market crashes but we         likely won't see that till August-November.\n \nLinks to Bullish signals on $Dell\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/tech-stocks-are-getting-pricey-here-are-12-stocks-still-worth-buyingand-1-to-short-51588972462?siteid=yhoof2&amp;yptr=yahoo\n\n\u201cHP Inc.

        "selftext": "Posted this yesterday. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gr2flr/warningdd_for_hpqdell_er_players/\n\nEntire tech supply chain is disrupted and on top of that corporate spending moving forward will be on the downtrend as most enterprise IT environments already finished WFH transitions. Not every company in the peripheral sector is as well positioned as Logitech. (i fuckin LOVE my RGB spark keyboard, spitting rainbows all day as I laugh at you bulls eating shit).\n\nLook at PLT's conference call.\n\n&gt; With that context, our Q1 guidance is as follows. We expect GAAP net revenues of $330 million to $365 million and our non-GAAP net revenues of $335 million to $370 million. Total adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $25 million to $45 million. And non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of a loss of $0.18 per share to a gain of $0.22 per share.\n\n&gt; Finally, I'd like to mention that these guidance ranges include our estimates of the impact of factory overhead underutilization due to lower production volumes, incremental freight due to supply chain challenges and the cost of factory reconfiguration.\n\nLook at HPQ's sector revenue pullback.\n\n&gt; Down 31% on commercial devices.\n\n&gt; Down 15% on ink supplies.\n\n&gt; Down 19% on printing division overall.\n\n&gt; Down 16% on consumer hardware (despite 5% laptop uptick).\n\nDell is probably going to eat shit, but I'm guessing best case they'll trade sideways as they'll have an uptick on laptop purchases to offset any negative guidance. Oh btw, Dell's Chief of HR just dumped $1.8M in options on Tuesday cuz he's a gay bear just like the rest of us.\n\nHPQ\n17p 5/29, 16p 5/29, 14.5p 5/29(hahaaa these were 5 cents/ea), 17p 6/19\n\nDELL 40p 6/19\n\n\nReminder.

        "selftext": "A lot of people act like the market has left everyone behind but there are still great companies on extreme discounts in a variety of sectors, including tech. Here are some stocks from my watchlist that are still well below highs:\n\n**Brookfield Asset Management - BAM** (26.17% down from 52w high) - a diversified asset manager company involved in real estate, renewable power, infrastructure and private equity assets. As safe a real estate play as you can make because of the wide moat. COVID-19 was the first snag they hit since 2008.\n\n**Workday - WDAY** (26.56% down from 52w high) -  provides enterprise cloud applications to  help its customers to manage critical business functions and optimize their financial and human capital resources. Beat Q1 earnings by a big margin and are still down.\n\n**Bruker Corp - BRKR** (28.32% down from 52w high) - makes scientific instruments and analytical/diagnostic instruments for a wide array of fields. Missed earnings this quarter, but this was a stock that grew 1200% from 2008 til pre-COVID.\n\n**Disney - DIS** (29.75% down from 52w high) - yes their parks are in limbo and many of their stores worldwide are shut down and their movies are suspended. But Disney has the resources to weather this storm, and Disney+ has been a lifesaver. If looking long-term, this price may never be seen again once they announce reopenings.\n\n**Exact Sciences Corp - EXAS** (32.29% down from 52w high) - Makes cancer screening tests. COVID-19 has temporarily slowed cancer screenings, but this could bounce back and has grown immensely the past 5 years. Additionally they acquired Genomic Health last year, which focused on genomic based genetic research for cancer detection.\n\n**Hewlett Packard - HPQ** (35.6% down from 52w high) - Strikes me as one of the most underrated large caps right now. They make great products, and it's highly likely an increase in remote work led to increased sales of laptops and printers. \n\n**JP Morgan - JPM** (36.26% down from 52w high) - The best run of the investment banks imo, as they are highly diversified. For a company hammered this hard, they are bound to come out of this even better positioned for the future. \n\n**Conoco Phillips - COP** (37% down from 52w high) - Has already shot way up the past month (I regret selling more than half my shares), but still far below it's highs so plenty more room to rebound. They struck me as one of the better positioned oil companies to make it through this and bounce back given their rock solid financials.\n\n**Raytheon - RTX** (38.64% down from 52w high) - whoever is President, it's hard to bet against the military-industrial complex. Pre-COVID, up 400% from the 2008 trough. Commercial and business aviation connections have definitely hurt them in the short term, but their military applications give them a broader moat, and they seem to be much better run than Boeing, for example.\n\n**StoneCo - STNE** (41.89% down from 52w high) - basically the Square of Brazil, from what I understand, and traded on Nasdaq. Develops fintech solutions for electronic commerce across in-store, online, and mobile channels for small and medium sized businesses. Unlike Square, it is apparently still accurately valued in a time of concern for small and medium size businesses. The added long-term benefit of being in a developing economy also seems to be a good selling point.\n\n**Pinterest - PINS** (49.42% down from 52w high) - has been considered a loser financially for a while, but it seems with the arrangement with SHOP  they are finally figuring out how to better monetize their platform -- which has an extremely loyal following among women especially. The potential for future growth for a stock that has surpassed Snapchat as the #3 social media site in domestic users (47% of internet users in the US, 2/3rds of those female) is enormous. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on these and their future potential for growth? How soon do you think they bounce back to ATHs?",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 25th, 2020.\n\n# **Market could get a boost as states reopen, but new economic data will show just how bad things got during shutdowns  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/22/market-could-get-a-boost-as-states-reopen-but-new-economic-data-will-show-just-how-bad-things-got-during-shutdowns.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks are likely to hang on every medical development and the progress of state reopenings, but there will also be some key economic data in the coming week that should provide a glimpse into the depths of the state shutdowns.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s beige book of economic activity is released Wednesday afternoon. There is also April manufacturing data in durable goods Thursday and April\u2019s consumer income and spending data Friday. While that should provide an interesting view of how sluggish activity became, the market is expected to focus more on May consumer confidence Tuesday and consumer sentiment Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe backward looking data is not going to get any attention paid to it,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be terrible, and that\u2019s not going to be a surprise. Confidence has held up pretty well, all things considered. It\u2019s the PPP and unemployment benefits. People who get some support for income seem to be pretty confident.\u201d Congress is expected to take up changes to the Paycheck Protection Program for small business when it returns June 1.\n*****\n&gt; April\u2019s economic data is expected to be about the worst of the recession, since most state shutdowns extended through a good part of the month, ahead of May reopenings. First quarter gross domestic product is expected to have declined by 4.8% when a second reading is released Wednesday, but for the second quarter, GDP is expected to decline by a median 33.1%, according to CNBC/Moody\u2019s Analytics Rapid Update, a survey of economists.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks gained in the past week, though rising tensions between the U.S. and China weighed on the market Thursday and Friday and could become a bigger headwind.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was heading for a weekly gain of 3%, its second weekly gain in three. A big catalyst came Monday, when Moderna disclosed positive data from a small group of patients in an early trial, but it was a wild week of trading for the company\u2019s stock as doubts arose about its limited results. On Friday, however, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the data showed promise and he was cautiously optimistic a vaccine would be developed.\n*****\n&gt; Astra Zeneca\u2019s vaccine effort got a boost this week when it received $1 billion from the U.S. Health Department\u2019s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to develop a coronavirus vaccine from the University of Oxford.\n*****\n&gt; With investors focused on vaccines and state reopenings, market winners were the more volatile Russell 2000, up 7.8% for the week and the Dow Transports, up nearly 9.1% as airlines and other reopening stocks rallied. Airlines were up nearly 20% on the week. After a batch of earnings reports, retailers were also higher on the week, with the SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF up 6% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; Retailers are again among the companies reporting earnings in the week ahead, as the first quarter reporting season winds down. Costco, Nordstrom, Ulta Beauty and Burlington Stores are some of the names reporting.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said he is watching the economic reopenings and says the success really depends on the behavior of individuals, and whether there\u2019s another spike in infections.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPeople are still scared,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the personal behavior that\u2019s going to make a difference to economic behavior. We\u2019ll get back to some semblance of normal. It\u2019s going to take awhile for people to feel more confident.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He expects to see a rebound of economic activity in the second half of the year, but not a V-shaped recovery.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cBy the end of the year, if we don\u2019t get a vaccine, we will have made a lot of progress on a vaccine. I\u2019m still cautiously optimistic that the market can hang in, and maybe end the year a little bit higher,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; One big reopening in the week ahead will be on Tuesday when the iconic NYSE trading floor reopens.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/AUZd4pd.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TGBcnTP.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/DjoySnm.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/yJXH3jZ.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Q0QEkmb.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/c5ZprTz.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jn7Momp.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Ym1qBMT.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Mr8CSMQ.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FPry3Mw.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/QGY45ds.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/qjKjCb6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/KiRgaMa.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Weekly Market Performance \u2013 May 22, 2020: Stocks Solid in the Midst of Health and Political Challenges\n\n&gt; # Equities\n\n&gt; US equities delivered solid returns this week. With three hours to go in the week, all three markets were up almost 3% for the week, with the best performer, once again, the technology-heavy Nasdaq. The small cap Russell 2000 Index enjoyed an impressive rally, with the index returning over 9% for the week. The mid-cap S&amp;P 400 Index also had a solid showing, returning almost 9%.\n\n&gt; Amid ongoing COVID-19 disruptions, rising unemployment, and risks associated with reopening the economy, US stocks continued to rebound. The rally was supported by all 50 states easing restrictions, based on improving COIVD-19 trends. Several timely indicators have pointed to a pickup in economic activity, including higher credit and debit card spending and an increase in travelers based on TSA data. Second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) could contract as much as 30% annualized, but global progress in reopening economies combined with massive stimulus measures point to a potentially strong rebound in the third and fourth quarters.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe S&amp;P 500 just had the second-best 40-day rally ever, with only the returns off the March 2009 lows better,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cNear-term, we have some concerns of a well-deserved pullback, but historically, these huge moves have tended to resolve much higher over the ensuing 6- and 12-month periods.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.22.20-wmp.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; In a change of pace, industrials were the top-performing sector for the week, followed by the energy sector. The worst-performing sectors were healthcare and consumer staples, and they posted returns that were slightly negative for the week. Looking at style, large cap value stocks edged out large cap growth for the week.\n\n*****\n\n# Leading Indicators Signal Potential Bottom\n\n&gt; Leading economic indicators are signaling that the pace of economic deterioration may be slowing. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI), a composite of leading data series, fell 4.4% month over month in April. While this is an undeniably abysmal reading, it is an improvement from the -7.4% in March.\n\n&gt; \u201dThe monthly LEI change tends to bottom early in a recession, and sometimes even before a recession\u2019s official start,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cStocks are forward looking, so if investors feel confident that the economic damage will not accelerate from here, they may be more willing to put capital to work. We think today\u2019s LEI number largely confirms April\u2019s strong moves in the equity markets.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Economic-news-5.22.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The performance of the 10 underlying components in the LEI does indicate some disconnect between financial markets and the real economy. The two largest positive contributors to the headline LEI number this month were stock prices and the interest rate spread, which were buoyed by a swift and robust monetary and fiscal stimulus. Meanwhile, data series related to manufacturing, unemployment, and construction hurt the index, a reflection of the damage done to the parts of the economy in which workers are unable to perform their jobs remotely.\n\n&gt; As local economies begin to reopen, we look for the industries disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 virus to begin to rebound. While this will likely be a bumpy process, progress will likely become evident in future LEI releases and confirm that the worst of the economic declines are behind us. We think this should pave the way for further equity gains over a long-term horizon.\n\n*****\n\n# What Happens When The Bear Ends?\n\n&gt; The incredible rally off the March 23 lows continues for equities, with the S&amp;P 500 Index now up more than 32% in 40 trading days. As impressive as the rally has been, we do have some near-term concerns, as we discussed in Downside Risk Remains. Higher valuations, US-/China relations, weakening technicals, and the historically troublesome summer months all could play a part in potential weakness after the record run.\n\n&gt; \u201cIn 40 trading days, the S&amp;P 500 gained 32%, which is second only to the 40 days off the March 2009 lows,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cLooking back at history shows that after the initial surge off of bear lows, stocks tend to correct about 10%, which is something we could see this time around.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 rallied nearly 21% in 30 days after all major bear markets. But once those initial rallies ended, there was a correction of more than 10% on average. Bottoms are a process, and as impressive as this run has been, we think the odds are quite high for some type of pullback or correction over the coming months. Thanks to our friends at Strategas Research Partners for the data points below.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.20.20-blog-chart-2-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Bottom Line EPS Beat Rate Below Average\n\n&gt; The first quarter earnings reporting period unofficially came to an end earlier this week, and it should be considered quite a success given how well the equity market performed during this time period. Since earnings season began on April 13th, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has gained more than 5%. Of course, the market's performance over the last month or so has much more to do with expectations on re-opening than how companies reported in Q1, but all things considered, the sky didn't fall when it came to earnings results.\n\n&gt; In terms of how actual earnings reports came in versus analyst expectations this past earnings season, the trend wasn't all that rosy. We've been tracking \"beat rates\" for more than a decade, which measure the percentage of companies reporting stronger than expected EPS and sales numbers (relative to consensus analyst estimates). Our main \"beat rate\" trackers show beat rates on a rolling 3-month basis -- meaning it looks at all companies that have reported earnings over the last three months and tells you what percentage of them beat analyst estimates.\n\n&gt; Below is a snapshot of both bottom-line EPS and top-line sales beat rates over the last five years as displayed on our website at our \"Earnings Explorer\" page. Notably, bottom-line EPS beat rates have been weakening quite dramatically over the last couple of months since the COVID crisis began. Just this week, the 3-month rolling EPS beat rate dipped below its long-term average of 59.37% dating back to the year 2000.\n\n&gt; On the other hand, top-line sales beat rates haven't taken quite the hit yet. The current sales beat rate stands at 60.67%. While sales on an absolute basis fell dramatically at the end of Q1, the fact that sales beat rates haven't fallen dramatically means companies have at least managed to keep up with analyst expectations. A very weak sales beat rate would have meant companies were reporting numbers even weaker than already dour analyst expectations.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/epsbeats.png))**\n\n&gt; We also have a forward guidance tracker that measures the percentage of companies raising guidance versus the percentage of companies lowering guidance. When this reading turns negative, it means more companies have lowered guidance than raised guidance over the last three months. As shown below, right now our guidance spread stands at -16.08 percentage points, which is the weakest reading we've seen since early 2016.\n\n&gt; One thing we've seen since the COVID crisis began is that more and more companies have withdrawn guidance altogether. It's hard to blame them. The ones that have issued guidance have mostly lowered expectations. While this paints a bleak picture for the future, if you look at this from a \"glass half full\" perspective, it actually leaves much more room for positive surprises down the road.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/guidance5yr.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Down Five Straight Day After Memorial Day\n\n&gt; Our office will be closed for observance of Memorial Day on Monday, May 25. U.S stock and bond markets will also be closed. As you spend some quality time off please consider taking time to commemorate those who have paid the ultimate price while serving in the U.S. military. Additionally, consider taking a moment to acknowledge first responders, nurses, doctors, law enforcement, firefighters, essential workers, scientists and everyone else that has tirelessly worked and sacrificed during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n&gt; For decades the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac has been tracking and monitoring the market\u2019s performance around holidays. The trading day after Memorial Day has a mixed record going back to 1971. Both S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have declined more often than risen on the day, but average performance is still modestly positive. Since 1986, the frequency of gains has improved, and average performance has also risen however, over the last five years S&amp;P 500 has declined. The second trading day after Memorial Day has more advances than declines, but average performance is negative for NASDAQ. The third day after appears to have the best long- and short-term record combined with solid average performance.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/17c1f2e9847dc9535fcaf9721be1fd15/cf4b21edc88189d8-06/s640x960/e768e94e9f16dd65cdae2b4f8d23f15f1b3806f5.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Election-Year June: Candidate Clarity Boosts Performance\n\n&gt; June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 49 years as a rule ranking seventh with a 0.8% average gain, up 27 of 49 years. This contributes to NASDAQ\u2019s \u201cBest Eight Months\u201d which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking tenth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.\n\n&gt; In election years since 1950, June\u2019s performance improves notably. June is the #5 DJIA month in election years averaging a 0.9% gain with a record of twelve advances in seventeen years. For S&amp;P 500, June is #2 with an average gain of 1.3% (14-3 record). Election-year June ranks #4 for NASDAQ and Russell 2000 with average gains of 1.6% and 1.4% respectively. This performance improvement is most likely the result of presidential candidate field being sufficiently narrowed, and the ultimate nominees being identified.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a72b7e4acd0417756738dc99296c53d9/b62a78126f7fd2f0-07/s400x600/2f93e5e52a2c425a44e8dd371d8628f5cdc01bdf.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$COST** \n&gt; * **$AZO** \n&gt; * **$DG** \n&gt; * **$DLTR** \n&gt; * **$CRM** \n&gt; * **$PLAN** \n&gt; * **$CGC** \n&gt; * **$BNS** \n&gt; * **$OKTA** \n&gt; * **$NIO** \n&gt; * **$RL** \n&gt; * **$WDAY** \n&gt; * **$CBL** \n&gt; * **$MRVL** \n&gt; * **$ESLT** \n&gt; * **$ADSK** \n&gt; * **$HPQ** \n&gt; * **$MOMO** \n&gt; * **$VEEV** \n&gt; * **$HIBB** \n&gt; * **$ZS** \n&gt; * **$ULTA** \n&gt; * **$TD** \n&gt; * **$CSIQ** \n&gt; * **$KEYS** \n&gt; * **$NTNX** \n&gt; * **$PLAB** \n&gt; * **$BMO** \n&gt; * **$BURL** \n&gt; * **$RY** \n&gt; * **$MGIC** \n&gt; * **$BOX** \n&gt; * **$ERJ** \n&gt; * **$ANF** \n&gt; * **$DELL** \n&gt; * **$CYD** \n&gt; * **$PLT** \n&gt; * **$VIPS** \n&gt; * **$COHR** \n&gt; * **$VIOT** \n&gt; * **$NTAP**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Mr8CSMQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/vZhPWXr.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 5.25.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

Now is the time to get in a week before earnings.

With schools literally fucking everywhere going online, computer sales are in high demand. Recently at a visit to walmart, (within the last 2 weeks) one of the employees mentioned how they were out of every single laptop they had. Said that people were buying the hell out of them. \n\nProblem here is I don't fucking work for walmart dell or hp so I have no idea how constant the restocking and selling out of these computers are. It could be as constant as everyday they're being stocked up and sold out (highly fucking doubt b/c financial issues but some people might use stimulus check on it).\n\nDell and HP are known for the affordability of their well built laptops. This would definitely prioritize these 2 companies during a time where economy isn't at its best.\n\nPlease add any additional info you have that could back this up. We might have a good opportunity here.\n\n$HPQ $DELL calls",

If y\u2019all been following, my past 2 posts have been smooth as baby cheeks. JD, PLT &amp; BJ have been a Stephen Curry swish so far. Alright let\u2019s get to the point.\n\n\nHPQ &amp; DELL. Yes you heard right this two veteran companies have their earnings calls next week DELL 5/27, HPQ 5/28. As we know, both companies took a downfall this March and have slowly but steady been on the come up to their regular pre-covid prices. Wall Street sees plenty of upside for these tech stocks after their earnings just like we seen with other tech companies that did pretty well this Q.\nThey\u2019ve been gaining some momentum already but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too late to hop in this train. Both companies took a hit yesterday but nothing major so it\u2019s a perfect time to buy in at a good price. I recommend to follow closely today and see if there is another dip and get your calls! \n\nPositions: DELL 6/19 47.5c (you can totally go for 50)\n                  HPQ 5/29 17c \n\nIf you want to play it safe try to get a closest ITM call for DELL since their earnings call comes first. If they do good it\u2019ll carry a good momentum for HPQ. \n\nThats is all, let\u2019s make this bread!!",

        "selftext": "$0.50 per share vs. $0.45 Wall Street forecasted. Sales were only $12.5 billion, below the consensus expectation of $12.8 billion, but that can't be the reason for such a drastic drop.\n\n[Motley Fool speculates](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/28/why-hp-stock-just-dropped-12.aspx):\n\n&gt;Rather, what has investors worried about  HP is the prospect that business will deteriorate in Q3, now that all  those work-from-homers have finished buying what they need to work from home -- or even no longer need their equipment as shelter-in-place  orders are lifted across the country.\n\nSeems like weird reasoning (with extra equipment sold, it doesn't matter whether they need it going forward or not - it's extra sales that wouldn't have happened under normal circumstances -- and there's no guarantee there won't be another lockdown in Q3 or Q4 requiring more home office purchases), but regardless, I wonder if this foreshadows Q2 being a bloodbath considering HPQ should have been one of the better off stocks here.\n\nI have only a tiny HPQ position, but because it's one of my worst performers and seems to be a pretty stable company I was looking to purchase more. Good idea to buy now on the overreaction or wait and see what happens to the economy with the Q2 earnings?",

        "selftext": "Hello there,\n\nI\u2019ve been trading options for quite a long time with all of the major brokers and have it set at level three approval almost everywhere. I stick to a pretty common strategy though in that I essentially just sell naked puts.  It fits my bank and risk tolerance.\n\nMy general strategy is in a volatile market, that I can determine more often than not when an OOTM Put has gotten a bit too high based on how far the stock is likely to fall.\n\nGenerally I\u2019ve been playing airlines lately and safely making $200-$500 a week on a $10k bankroll .\n\nAAL is a favorite because I can usually sell a $8 or $9 put for .15 or .20 (10 contracts) and let them expire worthless at the end of the week.  Obviously this works as long as the bottom doesn\u2019t fall out of the stock, but I have general plans in place to stop me from losing too much. I usually cut my losses at 2X of the option price, but a few times I\u2019ve gotten stuck after hours.  I was able to play $15 HPQ and sell the puts for .22 and buy back at .10 this week for instance.\n\nAnyway, all that to say I\u2019m having a hard time finding new stocks to follow which have higher weekly OOTM put values to increase my profit potential roughly 5 days before expiration.  I know the risk goes up here because it generally indicates that the stock will swing in price more or that there is significant uncertainty in something like earnings.\n\nI\u2019d like a tool/site/report to tell me about (I think) high IV puts, Below the market, below $20 a share, with volume, with an actual Bid/Ask spread that\u2019s reasonable.  The high IV report on E*TRADE is mostly worthless because it can\u2019t filter right.\n\nThe screeners I\u2019ve tried always get stuck showing the no bid stocks rather than better choices.  I suspect that in doing it wrong.\n\nAm I just being obtuse here and there\u2019s a better way to screen for what I want ?  \n\nThanks in advance",

The last few days have been insightful for me so I thought I would share.\n\nCurrently, I am over 200% with my portfolio (pennys only). The last few days have been a drag because i have finished cents above where i started that morning. Its a drag because you want gains of course. I have a relative who trade but options only. They have earned 7k in 3 days. 1 being thw HPQ option I posted was in my portfolio. It sucks in comparison for sure. Also compounded by missing NNDM. \n\nLooking at some of the recent posts about people losing their asses reassured me of what i was doing and to not grow greedy.\n\nI was holding UMRX and ONTX for a few days now. Those two seem impervious to recent noise. They go up and down but usually end about even. I sold them both with plans to buy back but used my funds to buy into TLSS and NOVN. Both which have now taken off. This also freed up funds to cover my daily losses on OGEN and GNUS which allows me to hold them for their inevitable pop. I also had funds allowed to double down on GNUS some more.\n\nThe account gains show i am cents above where i started but i am not. I now have stronger positions and got rid of stagnate options.\n\nIts true on the blackjack table and its true here. A PUSH IS A WIN!\n\nRestructure to hedge losses. Position yourself for opportunities. If you gain 1% a day with money invested.... thats more than a bank would give you. Shit i think thats what bonds get you now. \n\nPeople who say oh i only lost 100 of my 500 in my portfolio... THATS WHY YOU LOSE IT!!! THATS A 20% LOSS!\n\nCasinos use chips so you disassociate yourself with the money. Stocks do the same because they are numbers on paper. \n\nBe smart.",
