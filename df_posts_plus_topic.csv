# Earnings on 9/8

$GENI reports earnings on September 8th pre-market. $GENI has a huge MOAT and an exclusive deal with the NFL. Growth is fantastic, 120% EBITDA 2020-2022. $GENI has only scratched the surface as majority of revenue is from sports betting at the moment. Currently $GENI gets 2% of a cut as their take rate from sportsbooks. They are looking to increase this to 10%. Even if they were to increase this to 5%, this would give them major profit increases which will lead to faster industry growth. 

# $DKNG has a possible deal with ESPN worth $3B. $GENI and $DKNG move close together.

According to great DD from /u/WLSRTJP : $DKNG and ESPN may have a massive partnership coming that would allow for investors to see a volatile move upwards in share price similar to $AMZN and $AFRM.

**Can Workhorse Find the Strength to Bounce Back?**

The [USPS Next generation Delivery Vehicle Project]( was recently awarded to Oshkosh Defense, which had extreme effects on the share price of [$WKHS – Workhorse.]( However, the question I wanted an answer to is did this occurrence make Workhorse an undervalued growth stock, or is Workhorse still overvalued even after their share price was massacred? This question led me to undergo this analysis to find out.

**Company Overview:** 

Workhorse is a technology company focused on renewable, and cost-effective solutions in the transportation sector (they make EV’s). Workhorse is an all-American electric delivery truck, and drone manufacturer that is constantly looking for new ways to innovate and optimize their mechanisms. Workhorse is currently working on bringing their [C-Series]( electric **delivery trucks** to the market to fulfill previous order request. Workhorse is an OEM trying to satisfy the requirements for their Class 2 – Class 6 commercial-grade, medium-duty truck market.

Workhorse has highlighted some of the biggest benefits derive from using their vehicles, these include:

· Lower total cost-of-ownership compared to conventional gasoline/diesel vehicles (estimated to save $170k in fuel savings compared to their fossil fuel counterparts)

· Increased package deliveries per day through the use of more efficient delivery methods

· Improved profitability through lower maintenance costs and reduced fuel expenses

· Improved vehicle safety and driver experience.

Currently, Workhorse is selling their vehicles to their clients using the following distributors Hitachi, Ryder, and Pritchard. Furthermore, 2 of their distributors (Ryder and Pritchard) are also maintenance providers for Workhorse.

Currently, Workhorse has successfully delivered 370 electric delivery vehicles to their customers, and they are the only American OEM to reach these figures, which is quite the accomplishment. These customers consist of the following companies Alpha Baking, [FedEx]( Fluid Market Inc., Pride Group Enterprises, Pritchard, [Ryder]( [UPS]( and WB Mason.

Workhorse’s Series-C delivery truck comes in 2 configurations, a 650 cubic ft., and a 1,000 cubic ft configuration. Furthermore, their Series-C vehicles include lightweight materials, 360-degree camera’s, collision avoidance, best-in-class turning radius, and their very own roof mounted [HorseFly delivery drone.]( These features help to set Workhorse apart from both their electric and fossil fuel competitors, especially their roof-mounted drone.

**Investment Information:**

*USPS Next Generation Delivery Vehicle Project:*

Last year, Workhorse was in competition to win a USPS contract to manufacture 165,000 vehicles for USPS to order and use as mail delivery vehicles. There were 4 other participants in this program, and Workhorse delivered 6 of their prototype vehicles for testing to potentially win this contract. On February 23rd, 2021, it was announced that Workhorse would not be obtaining this contract, but rather Oshkosh Defense.

This came as a surprise to many people and investors and WKHS share price was greatly affected by this news. However, this also created a buying opportunity for investors, as this contract was not the be all and end all of Workhorse’s business. Workhorse still manufactures their electric vehicles and has great potential in the EV Trucking space.

*HorseFly Technology:*

As I previously mentioned, Workhorse has their HorseFly drones built into their delivery vehicles. These HorseFly drones are patented, unmanned, and are incorporated into Workhorse’s delivery vehicles in order to deliver packages more efficiently.

These HorseFly drones are capable of carrying up to 10 pounds of packages (payload) and can reach maximum speeds at approximately 50 mph (80km/hr).

The HorseFly system includes an aircraft, a Ground Control Station (GCS), supports takeoff/landing, and has a cargo handling system. This system is designed to support high volumes of packages, long days of use, little maintenance is required, and the system allows Remote Pilots in Command (RPIC) allowing one pilot to control multiple drones.

Workhorse’s drones have been proven to be safe, reliable, and capable of delivering packages.

*Metron:*

Workhorse has a cloud-based, remote management system to trach vehicular performance, which they have called “Metron”. [Metron]( collects data and signals while the truck is driving and stores this data in their database and is shared to their clients. This data will be used to map specific route parameters to better manage the battery power, which can help maximize efficiency and determine the ideal times and locations to charge their batteries.

*Partnerships:*

*Duke Energy:* 

Workhorse has entered into a partnership with [$DUK - Duke Energy]( to create an innovative battery leasing program that provides customers with options and cost-competitive alternatives. Duke can also provide depot-wide electrification, battery leasing, and distributed energy resources to Workhorse’s customers. Duke and Workhorse \[partnered to make an integrated solution to help reduce the costs of converting existing fleets to quicken their adoption.

*Moog:*

Workhorse has also partnered with a company called [$MOG-A - Moog]( This partnership is a joint venture (50%-50%) for the development of the unmanned aerial systems (UAS), (their drones). Teams from both Workhorse and Moog are working on developing these drones, their systems, and their sub-systems to improve their quality and make them the most capable UAS in the market. Their goal for these UAS is to be highly reliable, safe, and certified by the highest levels of government approval.

*Emission and Fuel Economy Standards:*

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issues increasingly stringent fuel/emission standards for 2021-2027. In this document they highlight Workhorse as a “vocational vehicle” manufacturer, which makes Workhorse eligible for flexibility and incentive programs, such as the [Averaging, Braking, and Trading Program (ABT).]( This program allows fuel consumption credits to be banked, traded, or averaged. This will allow Workhorse to sell these credits to companies who have larger than mandated emissions.

*Clean Air Act:*

Workhorse has already acquired their Certificate of Conformity from the EPA. This certificate is required to be able to sell vehicles in states covered by the Clean Energy Act (ie. California).

*Intellectual Property:*

Workhorse currently has 8 existing patents, 1 of which is Canadian and covers their vehicle chassis assembly, and the other 7 are American covering vehicle chassis assembly, vehicle headers, onboard generator system, UAS package delivery system, and their drive module. Additionally, Workhorse has 19 pending patent applications.

Furthermore, Workhorse has 14 issued trademarks (US, and Internationally) and has filed for 5 more trademarks.

*Property:*

Workhorse owns 2 pieces of real estate, one of which is their 250,000 sq ft manufacturing plant in Union City, Indiana, and the other is a 45,000 sq ft administrative, manufacturing, and R&amp;D plant in Loveland, Ohio.

Furthermore, Workhorse leases 2 factories which are also located in Loveland, Ohio.

It is good to see that Workhorse has purchased these 2 factories as they will have greater control over what they chose to do and their methods of manufacturing. Also, paying off equity in these 2 factories is essentially paying down an asset.

*Financial Information:*

· **2016 Stock Incentive Plan:** Currently, there are still 102,500 shares yet to be converted from existing warrants from Workhorses 2016 stock incentive plan. If these shares were to be converted and dumped into the market, it would cause a dilutionary effect of 0.08%

· **2017 Stock Incentive Plan:** Currently, there are 2,247,500 common shares, and 1,475,625 shares that can be converted from warrants that are yet to hit the market from Workhorse’s 2017 stock incentive plan. If these shares were to be put on the market this year, it would cause dilutionary effect of roughly 3.02% on existing shares.

· **2019 Stock Incentive Plan:** There are also 773,115 common shares that can be converted from warrants, and 4,332,011 shares that are yet to be issued from Workhorse’s 2019 stock incentive plan. If these shares were to be converted and dumped into the market, it would cause dilutionary effect of roughly 4.14%

· **Series B Preferred Stock:** In 2019, Workhorse offered some Series B Preferred Shares to accredited investors. Workhorse sold 1,250,000 of these shares, and each of these preferred shares can be converted into 7.41 common shares. If all of these preferred shares were converted there would be 9,262,500 common shares, however, we know that in 2019 and 2020, 1.6M shares were issued through the conversion of preferred shares. Meaning that there is a maximum of 7,662,500 common shares that can be converted. If all of the remaining preferred shares were to be converted, then it would cause a dilutionary effect of roughly 6.22%

· **2024 Convertible Notes:** Currently, there is $197.7M worth of convertible notes, which are convertible at $35.29/share. This means that there are 5,602,154 shares that can be converted from these notes. If this were to happen, existing shares would exhibit dilutionary effects of 4.55%.

· **Marathon Warrant Agreement:** In 2018, Workhorse sold Marathon Asset Management a warrant to purchase 8,053,390 shares for an exercise price of $1.25. If these warrants were to be exercised and sold, there would be dilutionary effects of 6.53%.

· **RSU and Options:** In Workhorses stock-based compensation they also offer options and restricted stock units (RSU), and as of December 2021, there are 1.97M shares available from options to be purchased at $2.10/share (exercisable over the next 1.8 years), and 1.37M shares in RSU’s (which is expected to be recognized over the next 1.7 years). If all of these options are exercised, and the RSU’s are vested then there will be dilutionary effects of 2.72%.

· **Financial Performance (Good):** Workhorse had a great year in 2020, as their net sales increased by 269.80% (and their cost of sales only increased by 123.56%), their net income was $69.78M (which is the first time they have reported a positive net income), they reported revenue from their drones for the first time, and they paid off $19.14M in long-term debt.

· **Financial Performance (Bad):** Workhorse’s gross loss increase by 113.35% however their surge in “other income” helped to prop up earnings (they are not making money from solely the sale of their vehicles), and their interest expense increased by 553.67%.

· **Liquidity:** Workhorse has nearly doubled their cash position YoY, from $23.9M to $46.8M. They noted that they will use some of this cash to finance projects in 2021 in their [SEC 10-K filing.](

*Management Team:*

**Duane Hughes (CEO, President, and Director):** Mr. Hughes has 20 years of direct experience and has relationships in the automotive, advertising, and technology industries. Prior to Workhorse, he worked at Cumulus Interactive Technologies Group as their COO, and prior to this he worked as VP of sales and operations for Gannett Co. Inc.

**Robert Willison (COO):** Mr. Willison previously served as the Director of Fleet Technology for Sysco Corp. Prior to Sysco, Mr. Willison worked as the CTO of Rav Technologies.

**Steve Schrader (CFO):** Mr. Schrader has over 16 years of experience in public and private companies in a variety of industries. Prior to Workhorse Steve was the CFO of Fuyao Glass America for 4 years.

**Stephen Fleming (VP):** Mr. Fleming worked at Workhorse for 9 years as corporate/securities counsel before being promoted to VP. Previously to that, Mr.Fleming served as the managing member of Fleming PLLC, which is a boutique law firm specializing in corporate/securities law.

Although these people do not have the most extensive background in the automotive industry they have a solid background in business, finance, and technology. This is good to hear as they should be able to run this business from a management standpoint, however, where these people lack expertise in the automotive field, they can consult their board of directors who have worked for companies like GM, Piston Group, Cadillac etc. This helps to create a well-rounded management team that I believe is capable of running this business properly.

**Investment Valuation:** 

Due to Workhorse’s current financial information, I am not able to create a DCF model in order to value the company. However, I was able to undergo comparable analyses, in which I compared Workhorse’s EV/Assets, EV/Revenue and P/B multiples to their competitors. In order to arrive at an unbiased valuation, I took a weighted average of the comparable analyses.

*EV/Assets:*

By comparing this multiple to their competition, I arrived at a fair value of $WKHS of $11.97, if this were the case the implied downside would be 22.91%.

*EV/Revenue:*

By comparing Workhorse’s EV/Revenue multiple to their competition, I arrived at a fair value of $535.36, which would imply an upside of 3347.23%. This is absurdly high and is due to $NKLA – Nikola having an EV/Revenue multiple of 153,392.

*P/B:*

By comparing Workhorse’s P/B ratio to their competitors, I arrived at a fair value per share of $14.73, which would imply a downside risk of 5.14%.

*Weighted Average Comparable:*

Since the EV/Revenue comparable implied such a large upside I gave it a weight of 6.6% (20% of equal weight (33%).) the other two results achieve in the comparable analyses are both then weighted equally at 46.7%.

By doing this I arrived at an estimated fair value per share of $15.93, which would imply that Workhorse has a potential upside of 2.58%. This essentially means that you are buying close to fair value, which helps to mitigate risk.

*Analyst Coverage:*

The [average analyst price target]( of 7 Wall Street analysts for $WKHS – Workhorse is $15.70, which would imply an upside of 1.09%, this implies that Workhorse is an undervalued growth stock. These estimates are similar to the results I achieved in my comparable analyses.

**Risks:**

· **Dilution:** Workhorse has had problems with their levels of dilution in the past as they have averaged 44.64% share dilution per year over the last 3 years. Furthermore, these high levels of dilution are also looking pretty likely in the future as Workhorse is yet to offer all of the shares from their 2016, 2017, and 2019 stock incentive plans, their Series B Preferred Shares, their 2024 Convertible Notes, their Warrant Agreement with Marathon Asset Management, their RSU’s, and finally their outstanding options. All of these programs, plans, and agreements will account for approximately 27.26% of future share dilution. This level of previous dilution, and the levels of expected dilution are very high, even for a high-growth, high-potential stock like Workhorse, and should worry current and potential investors alike.

· **Financial Performance:** As stated previously, Workhorse has a couple sections of their financial reports that did not look so favourable (gross loss increase, and high interest expense growth.) If Workhorse does not continue to make large sums of revenue from their “other revenue” segment, then their losses will appear bigger, and they may not report another positive year (like they did this year). This would be detrimental for the stock and scare off investors.

**Catalysts:**

· **Financial Performance:** Workhorse increased their net sales by 269.80% (and their cost of sales only increased by 123.56%), their net income was $69.78M (which is the first time they have reported a positive net income), they reported revenue from their drones for the first time, and they paid off $19.14M in long-term debt. As stated previously, this was Workhorse’s first time reporting a positive net income on their yearly statement, this could show investors that they have turned around the business, and if they continue this performance in the future, then it will solidify this belief and attract investors.

· **Social Sentiment:** According to [Utradea’s Reddit Tab]( Workhorse is the 4th most trending stock (in the past 24 hours) and the 9th most tending stock (in the past 48 hours) on Wall Street Bets and has an overall positive sentiment. We have seen the impact that Wall Street Bets has had on other trending stocks, so it will be interesting to see if Wall Street Bets can pump this stock for a quick return.

· **Short Squeeze Potential:** Currently, Workhorse has a short interest of 40%, which makes it a good candidate for s short squeeze. This stock has the potential to be squeezed, especially if Wall Street Bets takes an interest in it.

66.87% of the free float is short which is 44% of all outstanding shares. Yes, that’s true so I will repeat that. 66.87% of the free float is short which is 44% of all outstanding shares. 1.4 million shares shorted today 1 million returned.  Shorts burrying themselves with 400k more Shorts outstanding and it was green today…

(The ""Rocket Lab Holders"" means the people who owned it when it was private)

This means two things:

\-Insiders now have twice the incentive to drive the stock price to the moon.

\-If this happens, people who bought it on the open market will be somewhat diluted.

It  stands to reason that any major announcements/catalysts would happen  between late November and late January, as this is most likely to get  the insiders their bonus. What else might be happening in Q4? Oh, maybe [literally going to the moon 🌑]( Certainly as shareholders, we don't want to be diluted, but it's better to have a small piece of a big pie than vice-versa.

**Future prospects**

The moon is 239,000 miles from the earth, and the insiders have signaled that this corresponds to a $20 share price. Rocket Lab has also [announced it is going to Mars]( which is 38.6 million miles away. This means that the share price will be 38,600,000/239,000 \* $20 = **$3218.**

So wanted to write a revision because seriously, squeeze or not, this stock is seriously undervalued at these levels. 

They are an insuratech company trying to revolutionizing the healthcare industry. Unlike most insurance companies that just focus on the insurance part, OSCR thinks a technology-driven approach as core to their business model, as using tech can allow them to quickly adjust their platform to their members’ needs. They announced during their last earnings they were expanding to 3 new states (now at 22) marking their 5th consecutive year of expansion 

**EARNINGS**

-	Market cap of $3.1 billion. Literally Tesla having a +1% day would change its market cap more than the entire evaluation of this company. 
-	Even with an abysmal market cap they have $1.7 billion of cash on hand 
-	They beat EPS estimates of -0.47 by 25% (actual -0.35). Their profit margins are increasing quarter over quarter for the last 4 quarters. Still unprofitable but with its current trajectory, they’re on their way to profitability 
-	They also beat revenue estimates dramatically, expecting $590,000,000 but achieving $720,000,000, beating by 22%. They grew **360% YoY** which is absolutely exceptional 
-	That means this company is both making more revenue and more earnings on that revenue than expected, and they’re STILL at all time lows. 
-	Analyst coverage is all positive. Morgan Stanley reiterated its overweight rating (lowering the price target, but the target is still double current prices). Other analysts have targets ranging from 25-40

These market caps should be flipped. Tesla has a net income of 1.14 Billion and Baba has a net income of 21 Billion.

After observing quality pump and dumps, eh, I mean ""squeezes"", here for almost a year, I've finally decided to write my observations down so that you, too, can profit by FINALLY timing one right.

Step 1: bag hold a stonk. Odds are that almost 99.9% of us already qualify for step 1 with no additional effort.

Step 2: after tiring of bag holding for several months and watching your position flounder, or even lose more, decide to make an excellent (for WSB) DD. Make sure you denigrate the audience as much as possible, use astrology (TA) with your own red and green lines added, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, conspiracy tier theories on why it will go up and why hedge funds are shorting it. Don't worry if short interest really isn't that high. Just make it SOUND high and get all the apes on board by stoking their hatred of this invisible enemy that is the reason their dad isn't proud of them and that their last girlfriend is getting mercilessly railed by another dude.

Step 3: in addition to your bags, buy, near dated, way OTM calls. Do this before market close the day before you post your ""excellent"" DD. That last part is crucial.

Step 4: post your DD shortly after market close. Make sure to do it soon enough after market close that a bunch of apes will see it and upvote it, and start throwing shit around (rocket emojis and meaningless motivational bullshit about said stonk). Ensure you answer any criticism by insulting, preferably by insinuating the challenger enjoys watching his wife or girlfriend get railed by other dudes, or prefers the company of men, while also giving half answers and saying how ""invested"" you are in the stonk based on how long you've been invested in it.

Step 5: everything is in place. Now, my child, just wait until slightly after market open. If you followed the steps appropriately, you should be able to offload those bags you've been holding, AND offset all losses (and maybe even make some sick gains) by selling the near dated calls you were instructed to buy.

Boom. There you have it. This is how you perfectly time a squeeze, wsb style. It's fool proof (which is perfect since we're all fools here).

First of all- look at the institutional ownership. 



Secondly, look at the average price target.

The day after the bad news, there was tons of buying at a discount. Look at these funds- THEY Loaded the Boat after the bad news.

&amp;#x200B;

In all reality, I have been wrong 3/3 times on prpl earnings. That being said, I am correct about the long term trajectory. PRPL will do 800-850M this year and they are on target for2-2.5B in 3-5 years as per their investor day. We are down from an all time high of 41 but revenue has continued to grow.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not a short squeeze expert, but the fact that 101% of the float is owned is interesting, especially considering there is about 6% of the float shorted.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR. don't buy options, shares, leaps and short puts. PRPL has been trading flat for about 2 months and I think it's due and have been saying it's due for a correction upward.

My position is in stock and leaps. About 2M in total: this is one of my two accounts holding shares.

✅ Lordstown Motors has confirmed, The Endurance Production Begins in September

✅ The Endurance is being marketed initially as a fleet vehicle and comes with work truck features.  Future luxury options will be added to tailor toward retail and lifestyle owners.

✅ The Endurance has been tested over a million miles in a last-mile delivery capacity and the regenerating braking is fully proven under stop and go.

✅ The average US Fleet vehicle travels 80-100 miles per day.  The Endurance standard is 250.  Larger capacity batteries will be offered later.

&amp;#x200B;



✅ You can spring lift the Endurance if you need more than the standard 15” clearance.

✅ Alternate bed styles (bucket, rails, toolboxes, cap, utility, storage.. are all fine).

✅ Endurance hub motors have integrated standard disc brake, standard outer caliper and a hub bearing.  Standard rims and tires are changed as a standard truck would.

&amp;#x200B;



✅ LMC Director of Sales told people in March that they were accepting POs.

✅ Working with outfitters to offer Trailer package, toolbox, snowplows, all of that will be available.  Available with a bed-delete for custom applications.

$150 price target will place it at $26.55B market cap, which is lower than the next 24 months of projected revenue for the company.

🚀 ACTExpo reported registration was nearing 5,000 (that was early Monday before the event even began.)  Can you imagine how many people are experiencing the Endurance in person this week? [ (Long Beach, CA)  LMC is also at NAFA this week (Pittsburgh PA):

&amp;#x200B;



As far as specifications go, we know that the four in-wheel hub motors produce a total of 600 HP (608 HP), enough for a 0-60 mph (0-96 km/h) sprint of 5.5 seconds and a governed top speed of 80 mph (128 km/h).

Not to late to join, headed to $20 to $30 and will pay a dividend in 2022/2023.

Previously, I posted my deep thoughts in regards to $COTY in a reddit post 7 months ago. Since then the stock is up around 50%. I am posting this update here because I think it is important or prudent to follow up with a complicated story like COTY. Many in the industry like to chase things not realizing that sometimes good things take time to play out. I know we all want to make 100% returns daily, who does not, but I see COTY as an excellent long-term hold that offers a very safe business model, with some high-quality brands and operated by an extremely competent management. Also, I like to post on REDDIT to get feedback from people in regard to my thoughts or thesis in a constructive way. I like it all the good and the bad, it keeps me humble and honest. 

Nevertheless, COTY is extremely interesting to me because it has so many moving pieces that even WallStreet analyst are divided as to what the value of COTY is today. COTY was like a beaten up F1 that was ran by an incompetent manager, driver and mechanic (the owner is still the same). So, they hired a new manager (Sue Nabi), mechanics (KKR) and drivers (all the new Execs) and were able to sell some car parts, re-do the entire engine, to perform faster and better on the track but has still not gotten a paint job. So, this is why it is so confusing the new COTY is different you just can’t see it yet until it wins a few races and proves that it can compete and win there will be doubt. 

The bears have hold ratings but keep raising their price targets every quarter as they are still in denial but have to raise price targets as they can’t keep them at $4. The bulls have set targets at $15 and over time will be changing those to $18, $20, etc. as the company keeps executing its plans. 

If I were to sum up the COTY story it would be as follows:

· Management change = change in culture top to bottom (takes time)

· Less Brands = less costs and more focus on a few major brands

· Marketing spend better monitored and spent = better results 

· Debt reduction means equity value increases

· Less manufacturing assets = more marketing/branding company

· High margins = more profits for shareholders

· China, Direct to Consumer and extension of products with major brands

If I were to sum up the catalysts for the stock over the next year it would be the following:

· Company continues to beat quarterly revenue guidance and guides up (this is due to better product mix and better marketing)

· Company continues to beat Margin/EBITDA guidance and guides up (this is due to the major cost cutting but also DTC offers better margins)

· Brazil IPO nets them $200 million 

· Wella Stake is sold for $2 to $3 billion via IPO within the next 6 to 24 months. 

· Company continues to reduce debt, therefore value of equity increases. 

· Company decides to re-instate dividend within the next 12 to 24 months. I think they should do it next year until. 

I decided to update my model and I would like to share it with you all today. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img tox2y68klpk71...*

If you notice in my summary model I have a $17.60 price target by August of 2022 as you all know this is my opinion and NOT a certainty. This valuation was based on a multiple of EV to Revenues ranging from 2x to 5x with an average of around 3.5x EV to Revenues for a business like COTY. If you notice the industry leaders like Estee Lauder and L’Oreal are trading at 7x to 8x EV to revenues and because COTY is no where near the level of GROSS MARGINS, EBITDA MARGINS and NET PROFIT MARGINS of COTY that means it deserves a discount, I used a 50% discount to peers. Now, you can argue that the company should trade at a premium to that in the short-term as the company keeps improving but I like to be more on the conservative side of things. It is what helped me make the decision to start buying the stock at $2.75 last year. 

The next model you will see is a 10 year model which I like to do because it lets me see how the numbers can really improve. I know that this is never going to be accurate but what we CAN see are things like CAPITAL EXPENDITURES run rate or how the split of marketing will be higher over time but that all of the cost cutting they have done the past year or so is going to show on the General and administrative line starting next year and the year after. To be able to cut hundreds of millions of dollars in costs during COVID and before given the expertise from KKR is mind boggling. It also lets me see where the growth is coming from or CAN come, ASIA/CHINA. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img x4nlw2rllpk71...*

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img e61w34wmlpk71...*

Nevertheless, these models will change every quarter but I like to see how the business can APPROXIMATELY look like over the next 5 to year years. For example, in this model it does NOT show what happens to the DEBT if the company does sell the 40% stake of WELLA via IPO which has a high chance of happening within the next year or so. This is being valued at $1.3 billion but I think it can be $2 billion or more if they hold it for longer as the market realizes the value of that business, it is a true gem. Also, the company just announced that they want to sell between 20% to 40% of the Brazil division via IPO and seek around 200 million USD. I found this move to be very interesting as it is a KKR type move to extract some value out of an asset but also I think a very good political move as things are very shaky in Brazil on the political side of things and there could be some risks in the future so them taking out cash now while things are hot, I think is an excellent move for shareholders. 

In conclusion, I still think COTY is a buy for people who give a damn about owning a piece of an amazing business. I think many will be surprised how this company will keep surprising people for years.","$COTY Turnaround is happening. Not to late to join, headed to $20 to $30",14,13

PVH Corp is an American fashion company that derives most of its revenue (90%) from its two mid-upscale brands Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein. In Q1 of 2021, they posted USD2.079 bn in revenue. At the top end of their guidance range, they are calling for USD 2.150 bn in Q2 revenue, representing a modest 3.4% increase from the first quarter. I believe that is conservative and they will outdo the expected numbers.

**Reason 1: comparison to peers**

We've had several retail earnings reports in the recent past. The ones that did well include Macy's, Kohl's. The ones that did badly include Urban Outfitters, A&amp;F and Nordstrom. I believe PVH falls in the category of Karen stocks, women who also frequent Macy's and came out shopping in droves once vaccines were available.

**Reason 2: lockdowns and physical revenue**

Unsurprisingly, New York and California are the two biggest markets for PVH (as they target preppy wannabes). These two states were in HEAVY lockdown in Q1. For most of January and February, almost all counties in California were in the purple tier, meaning most retailers in the state were entirely closed. Things started improving a ton right around March/April, in time for Q2. I'd very surprised if the revenue increase from Q1 really ends up being as low as guided.

&amp;#x200B;



California Tier ratings

**Reason 3: Digital revenue**

While PVH is more of a brick-and-mortar retailer, they do have a DTC business. Both their websites did very well on website traffics recently, with tommy going from a 10m clicks per month average to 13.2m in July. Visits to Calvinklein increased compared to Q1 in the USA, UK, France and Germany. This despite the fact that lockdowns were lifting in these months, so you might have expected more foot traffic replacing some online traffic. But I believe they will outdo expectations on both revenue channels.

**How this could go wrong**

* Retail is hard to value in a Covid world and really I have no idea how this is going to go. They might beat and plummet, or miss and spike up tomorrow

* They might sandbag guidance with some vague reference to the Delta variant
* Options aren't all that liquid

I saw how things were going, and I decided that I was going to do a little option trading.  I had $4880.42 in cash in my account, and I wanted to go slow at the start of the day.

I bought 10 contracts of QQQ for 1.20 plus commissions and fees, and turned around and sold it at 1.38 in a few minutes.  Day started off great making $180 roughly in 2 minutes.  If I hadn't paper handed it, I could have made a couple K more, but that's a different story.  Either way it wasn't a loss.

I next decided to have some lunch, and see how the day was going.  I was kicking myself for the paper hands, and decided I needed to go a little bigger.  I was trading cash, so I could only lose what I had on hand.

I decided that I needed a bigger return, and in order to do so, I needed something that was leveraged, and because NASDAQ was going crazy, TQQQ sounded like a good idea.

So I bought 20 contracts of TQQQ at 1.83 plus costs and fees.  I thought I wasn't going to let my paper hands get the better of me, so when it was up almost 1K, I decided to sell.

Made money for the day, and used all of my cash on hand for interday trading.  Time to just watch the market.

Paper hands yesterday cost me a good 4 or 5 K that I could have made instead of 1K, but a win is a win.

I log into my account today, and I get a message that I have a Good Faith Violation on my account.  I try to figure out why this happened, because I was only using what I though was my intraday buying power.  I was wrong.  So wrong.

My first call cost 1206.83 and my second cost 3673.66.  Those two together cost 4880.89 and was $0.07 over my cash on hand.  Because I had credits from winning trades, my broker allowed me to use the credit to purchase additional stocks.

That store you always go to to buy things for your wife so she might actually sleep with you for once in her life? Yeah... Well it turns out BBBY is far from dead and has successfully rebranded itself into an undervalued e-commerce giant poised for massive future growth!

&amp;#x200B;

**Fundamentals:**

Despite being in the middle of a digital transformation from a retail store into an e-commerce giant while dealing with a global pandemic and supply-chain shocks, BBBY has managed to grow at a rapid pace while maintaining stable gross margins and a strong balance sheet

&amp;#x200B;



In Q1 2021, BBBY experienced 49.5% revenue growth while still increasing their gross margins to 32.4% through streamlining their operations. Additionally, their past 4 quarters of online sales have all had consecutive sales growth, breaking the seasonal trend and showing a great movement towards ecommerce

Q2 should be even better for them as they have continued streamlining operations and expect to post over 2B in revenue

BBBY has over 1.2 BILLION dollars of cash on-hand which they can use to continue moving towards e-commerce, create in-house products, and keep up growth. That cash alone is 40% of their ENTIRE market cap, not even including additional assets.

Management has seen how undervalued their company is and has repurchased $130m of shares to take advantage of this, with more share purchases to come. This shows how strong of a position they are in and how confident management is that their stock will increase in the future.

&amp;#x200B;



Even though they are focusing on growth instead of profitability right now, BBBY’s P/E ratio is STILL in line with the S@P 500 average

&amp;#x200B;

Ok... now that you understand how undervalued this company is, let me introduce to you the management

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Management:**

Management is one of, if not the most important factors for how well a company will do, and BBBY has some of the best management a company could hope for

&amp;#x200B;

Mark Tritton, the current CEO, has had over 30 years of experience in retail and oversaw Target’s streamlining and digital transformation as Executive VP. He has a clear vision for the company and has the industry connections and know-how to get it done

&amp;#x200B;

Gustavo Arnal, the current CFO, has had experience turning around struggling companies before, most notably Avon. He has experience leading WBA’s global division and can help the company reach international markets

&amp;#x200B;

John Hartmann, the current COO, has had experience being the CEO of True Value Company which focused on hardwear. He also has experience working in Home Depot’s digital transformation program. He can help BBBY create some products of their own while guiding this digital push

&amp;#x200B;

There are many more amazing people on the leadership team, but these 3 are the ones who stand out to me due to their unique abilities in certain fields

&amp;#x200B;

Management is what creates and directs a company’s visions and operations. With these 3 people on their team, BBBY covers all needed areas; Digital transformation, global supply-chains, hardwear production, and financial streamlining

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Shorts:**

Despite being in such a good position, BBBY still has a 23% short interest left over from the whole meme stock surge in January(edited)

&amp;#x200B;



This is not enough to cause a squeeze, but what it has been doing for the past few months is providing a price floor (at around 26$) and upward momentum as shorts take the loss and move on.

&amp;#x200B;

**Meme stocks:**  

My play is based around the fundamentals of the company, but meme stocks are so closely correlated that it makes sense to mention them

Price action with BBBY has been closely correlated with other meme stocks since the January squeeze. If my theory is correct and meme stocks have a resurgence, we could see BBBY mooning again

&amp;#x200B;



**This play is more about how undervalued the company is, but if you believe that there will be a new meme stock cycle then buying short dated calls could work. The call options have such low open interest that they are trading way below what they should be**

**Positions:**

120 Shares, 25 30c 9/3, 25 29.5 9/10, 10 30c 9/17

**TLDR:**

BBBY is undervalued and overshorted. This provides a great long term play as the company keeps doing better and shorts keep closing their positions

If you believe there will be a new meme stock supercycle, there are plenty of cheap options you can purchase too.

[My scheme to steal Everlasting Gobstopper recipe](

# How will AST SpaceMobile change the world?

* **First space-based cell tower network ever to provide 5G direct to your smartphone 🚀 &gt; 🛰 &gt; 📲 using GIANT SATELLITES**
* Will serve as PRIMARY cell service for developing nations where populations aren't concentrated and cell towers prohibitively expensive to build and maintain
* Will serve as complementary service in developed nations, as even in the developed world plenty of coverage gaps.
* $1 trillion total addressable market, 5 billion mobile phones moving in and out of coverage, 51% of world without high speed mobile coverage.

# How will AST make ALL THE TENDIES?

* **They will be a wholesaler so they don't compete with existing mobile providers or need to market (zero acquisition cost &gt; high margins).**
* **They have exclusive 50/50 revenue share coverage agreements with AT&amp;T, Vodafone, etc countless others covering 1.5 billion subscribers, with more added each month.**
* Major test launch March 2022, Phase 1 late 2022/early 2023 covering equatorial countries, Phase 2 late 2023/early 2024 for global coverage
* Fully funded through Phase 1, then revenue from Phase 1 will fund Phase 2, etc.
* AST has received significant strategic investments from Vodafone, Rakuten (Amazon of Japan), American Tower (largest cell tower company in the world), and Samsung

[Idea how tech works from company's Everlasting Gobstopper recipe](

# What about ""competitors"" like Starlink, etc. who want to steal all the tendies?

* **AST has NO DIRECT COMPETITOR, they are the only ones who will beam 5G high speed directly to your smartphone WITHOUT extra equipment.**
* Starlink beams internet to your home, building, large vehicle and still requires an antenna dish.
* Traditional sat phone providers require a bulky and expensive special phone
* Lynk is trying to do satellite service too BUT they are focused on text message only.
* Recent ""Apple rumor"" mentions satellite service but actually is not, only is expansion of terrestrial spectrum.
* AST also has over 1,000 patent claims to protect its proprietary and revolutionary technology.

&amp;#x200B;

[Only SpaceMobile will get you that golden ticket](

# Financials and Future Price

* **Project 2024 annual revenue of $1 billion, and by 2030 annual revenue of $16 billion with 90% EBIDTA margins.**
* Next main catalyst is final test launch of its BlueWalker 3 satellite in March 2022. They have already launched a successful proof-of-concept satellite previously, but BW3 will be at near production size.
* **Expect major runup to BW3 test date. AST is currently valued at only about $2 billion ($12/share). In 2017, about 7 months prior to Starlink's first test launch, it was valued at $15 billion ($83/share).**
* With successful final testing and launch of Phase 1 service, if you compare to American Tower (cell tower company) and its valuation based on 2024 revenue, **AST next year should be valued at $22 billion ($120/share). If you compare to Starlink's current valuation in their first year of non-mobile high speed commercial service, it's valued at $55 billion ($300/share).**
* **By 2027, if AST is on track for $16 billion revenues in 2030, it would be valued at $350 billion ($2000/share), which would be almost 200x returns from now.**

# Super low float with institutions adding

* 75% of outstanding shares are held by CEO, insiders, and above-mentioned strategic investors
* Another 10% or so are held by major institutions including Blackrock, Vanguard, Point72 (Steve Cohen owner of NY Met's fund), Greenlight Capital (David Einhorn's fund), D.E. Shaw, and Morgan Stanley.
* **Only about 25 million shares left in its free float, including almost 15% short interest.**

# Analysts agree

* Price targets of $35 from Deutsche Bank and $29 from Barclays.
* **Deutsche Bank adds: ""2024 is early in this project's lifecycle. If we take AST management's 2030 EBIDTA of more than $16 billion and apply a 10x multiple (which we think is still conservative given the business' expected growth profile), this implies a 2030 enterprise value of $163 billion (vs $2 billion today). Discounting that EV back to present time at a 15% discount yields a share price of roughly $190 today.""**

# Risk

* Does tech actually work? AST has shown through a prototype satellite previously that connected via 4G-LTE on the ground, but at large production/commercial size, won't know for sure until BW3 launches.
* Major delay in launch/testing. A few days/weeks delay due purely to launch provider/bad weather issues is fine, but if AST says they are delaying due to tech issue or they are not ready, that would not be good. They are launching via SpaceX rocket which has a very high success rate, so launch provider is not a major concern.

&amp;#x200B;

*The above is my own personal opinion and should not be used as investment advice. Do your own research/DD and figure out for yourself what is right for you.*","DD on $ASTS AST SpaceMobile to $2000, Golden Ticket to Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory🚀🛰📲🍫🍭🍬",454,7

To put some context:

Too many people still think they are RGB and some peripherals (mouse, keyboard and headphones).

Corsair is a video game holding company. They do pretty much everything.

Corsair has acquired several companies the last 3 years: ScuffGaming, Origin, GamersSensei, Elgato, Visuals By Impulse....

All that's left is to enter the mobile gaming world and they will literally dominate the entire gaming market. And seeing their pace of acquisitions, I'm sure they will sooner or later.

The company is focusing lately on the streaming world (elgato, Visuals By Impulse), which as I'm sure you all know, is growing at an unstoppable pace, competing head to head with traditional television. It is only a matter of time before it becomes the most popular way to consume content.

It is also looking to improve its service and subscription revenues (ICUE).

In the last few months alone they have launched 84 products, shipped 33 million around the world and acquired 3 new companies.



They are expanding very aggressively, and currently sell products in 26 categories:

&amp;#x200B;



They have some of the largest communities of all video game brands:



All of its segments are growing at an astounding rate, but as you can see, the content creators segment is simply incredible. Elgato has a virtual monopoly in the capture, spotlight, streamdeck, green screen and they have just launched a facecam that is getting very good sales.



These spectacular results have been achieved at a rather adverse time.

Shipping costs have risen dramatically due to inflation, especially for container shipments from China.

Chip shortages have also been a big problem and, let's not forget, corsair has a leading position in ram memory, power supplies, magnetic levitation fans, RGB... and nowadays it is very expensive to buy a graphics card. Which has prevented many people from building their own computers.

We also come from a period of pandemic, many people thought that its sales were going to plummet, but in spite of all this, it has produced very good results.

Since 1950, the Dow Jones has averaged a decline of 0.8% in September, while the S&amp;P 500 has experienced an average decline of 0.5%. Some call it the ""September effect"" It's a worldwide phenomenon; it doesn’t only impact the U.S. markets. Some analysts believe this negative market effect can be attributed to a seasonal behavioral bias created by investors deciding to make changes to their investment portfolios or raising cash at summer’s end.

Some analysts believe that this negative effect is attributable to a seasonal behavioral bias as investors make changes to their portfolios at summer’s end by “cashing in” on some of their year-to-date gains. Other investors may be preparing for both the end of the current year and positioning investments for next year as well.

Another reason may be that mutual funds, many of which have fiscal years ending in September – the traditional end of the 3rd quarter – and in October, may decide to harvest any short and long-term tax losses by liquidating their negative return holdings before year-end.

One other theory points to the fact there are lower trading volumes during the summer months. Many investors take vacation time during the summer and refrain from actively trading their portfolios during this downtime. However, once these vacationing investors return to work, they exit positions they had planned to sell. When this occurs, the market experiences an increased level of selling pressure and, as supply exceeds demand, the markets experience an overall decline.

Current status, we've been hovering at the 0.382 fibo level from the recent pump to ~ 70 $. 

Pease review history: last time we pumped from our original pumpage to ~20$ and consolidated, touched the 0.236 fibo area of support and then remained quite strongly at 0.382 fibo cluster before major launch to 70$ zone.  (which went all the way up to the 3.618 fibo planetary solar zone.

Given the similar hovering of our 0.382 fibo I think we will extend quite nicely into 200$ plus territory like we pumped from the last 0.382 fibo after AMC originally pumped. See here: 

The key is breaking the thick red resistance line of seller pressure. But I think we are inevitably close given the strong uptrending MACD and recent hint of volume pumpage.  If that thick red line is broken we launching to space, -- then moon. Cmon you apes, lets get our NASA drills in!

Chewy is without a doubt the leader when it comes to ecommerce pet food and supplies, and a case can be made that they are THE LEADER in all pet food and supply sales. In the most recent quarter, they reported ~20M active customers. In the USA, it is estimated that 85M families own pets. That puts Chewy at ~25% market share, which is extremely impressive considering the age of the this company. 

Since 2016, Chewy has grown revenue 133%, 67%, 37%, and 47%. In addition, 68% of revenue comes from auto ship. Meaning that a lot of this revenue is reoccurring. Meaning that Chewy will not lose many customers and can grow revenue for cheaper. 

TWO FACTORS TO CONSIDER FOR GROWTH

First is top line growth... 

Sector predicted to have a CAGR 5.5%. Humanification of pets is real. People love their pets and spend a ton on them. 

Company data shows that customers on average spend $400 in their second year, $700 in their fifth, and $900 in their ninth. This implies revenue growth just by keeping customers and during the pandemic, Chewy acquired many new customers. 

Other avenues for future growth include, expanding internationally and sales of private label items and hardgoods. Sales of hardgoods YoY grew 67%, which is a good sign. 

All in all, there are many ways for Chewy to maintain strong growth, and many ways for Chewy to surprise to the upside. 

Second is bottom line growth... 

Chewy is on pace to report it's first profitable fiscal year. This is very impressive considering the growth rate of this company. YoY Chewy saw net margins increase 4.8% to a positive 1.8%. However, these margins are still very low and should continue to grow over time especially when you consider the reoccurring revenue from auto ship. A similar company with way more overhead, Petco, has net margins of +5%. In my opinion, Chewy can achieve net margins of 7.5% - 10%. 

Applying a modest 25% revenue growth and net margins of 7.5% this would put revenue at ~27B, net income at $1.9B, and EPS of $4.51 in 5 years. Matching Petco P/E of 65, CHWY would be valued at $293. That's a 225% increase! Too hard to pass up considering that's BASE CASE!! 

The cherry on the top... 

Short interest % of float is 18.85% and volume is low at 1.6M shares. A spike in interest could drive the price up, squeeze shorts, and still provide fundamental value for new investors to buy creating more of a short squeeze until the stock seems overvalued which wouldn't be until $200+.

I quit my job when I got back and was thinking about buying some stocks. Was looking at maybe day trading GME or AMC, those seem to be the most popular. I only need about $1400/month for my expenses and I’m planing on maybe taking out another 20k loan so I can really go all in on this. 


Here’s what I got:
40k winnings + 40k I initially bet with
20k loan from the bank
10k cash advance on my moms credit card


I was thinking an even split on GME and AMC might send me to the moon. My expenses aren’t too bad so I can hold over if nothing is gonna hit just yet plus I’ll have to start paying this cash advance back monthly. Maybe I can get some pointers on other stocks y’all think is worth looking into. 

Also when do y’all think I should pay off the cash advance? Once I’m bringing in the bags I might just pay it off at once.

EDIT: my wife’s boyfriend is actually gonna loan me the 10k so I’ll pay him back interest free. No need to advance on my moms card 🙏

EDIT 2: I’m moving to Vegas, just talked it over with the wife. She said her bf is also moving there too so it’s all falling into place. Y’all are the best ✊

EDIT 3: Talked to my priest (who was the one who set up my wife and her boyfriend) and he recommended I look into investing in alt coins. It allows me to night trade, so that's a huge plus. I also see a lot of influencers coming out with their own coins, maybe I can get there someday. Thanks for the help guys!",Hit 40k in black and thinking about investing it in stocks.

""In line with the new FINRA rules, our new policy allows for only one flag removal within the life of an account. This means that if your account is flagged again in the future, the flag cannot be removed. Previously, our policy allowed the flag to be removed from an account up to three times within a rolling year before the account was flagged permanently. 

What if your account is flagged? If your account is flagged for pattern day trading, you'll have to maintain a minimum equity balance of $25,000 at the start of each trading day to continue day trading. If you place a day trade in a flagged account with a balance under $25,000 in equity, you'll be restricted to closing transactions until you bring your equity above $25,000.""

I strongly believe a new meme cycle is beginning. I'm sure you guys have seen the meme stocks going up the last few days, or since Aug 24th. Since missing some of the last one, I have decided I will not let that happen again. After some quick late night DD, I think it is time to go back to an old WSB favorite. I have loaded up on deep out-of-the-money BBBY FDs..

&amp;nbsp;

**Comparison to Last Meme Cycles:**

I'm sure some of you have seen the theories as to why these spikes happen on certain dates. Whether or not any of those are true, I do believe we are entering the third meme cycle looking at the dates. If last meme cycles were any indicator, GME / AMC lead the pack and the rest follow. New memes are born and old ones comeback. For me, the smartest way to play this is through the stocks that follow. GME and AMC calls are already jacked to the tits for me to feel comfortable buying. However, I still want exposure to this meme cycle. I'm looking for stocks that move with the memes that also have low IV/ cheap options.

&amp;nbsp;

**BBBY:**

-This is where BBBY comes in:

* 24% SI of the free float according to Ortex. Up 6% (  ) 
* Around the same as last huge squeeze to $53.90 (  ) 
* Options are incredibly cheap compared to most other meme stocks. 
* Has been slowly ramping up. Moved very similarly to the other memes last time. 
* Old WSB Favorite (This Bald headed bastard loves it too) Me too Cramer! - 

&amp;nbsp;

**Fundamentals:** 

All I have for fundamentals is from my ""value investing friend"" who had a 2.0 GPA as a finance major. He says that it is ""criminally undervalued"". I'm gonna take his word for it, but this is not the purpose of this trade. Others could probably make a better bull/ bear case on the fundamentals.

&amp;nbsp;

**Plan:**

I'm sure this trade is obvious to many of you. This is really for people who are too retarded to realize that other stocks move with GME / AMC. There are probably other similar picks that may do well too, but I like this one the best. My plan is to reload on FDs every week until September 17th. I am not planning to gamble my entire account this is just my best pick for exposure to it. If the price goes anywhere from 40-50, these calls are some ridiculous times my money right now.

&amp;nbsp;

**TLDR:**
 
If GME / AMC go up - BBBY goes up. If it squeezes anywhere near where it did last time/ unbelievable tendies will be made.

&amp;nbsp;

**Positions:** 34c (Sept 3rd) 71 Contracts

His strategy is the best that exists... but just not for the normal individual investor. You can’t copy the strategy of him, as it is based on the cash flows of his other businesses (like insurance). Still, you can use the value investing approach to make a lot of money. You just need to adjust it somewhat.

Many investors already use this strategy. You probably have heard about some of them. Michael J. Burry, Roaring Kitty (DeepFuckingValue) and Andre Kostolany are the main inspirations for this article (obviously Buffett and Munger are still my biggest idols, but at this point of time I am just too broke). Just a sidenote: I am not a professional investor and I only started investing a year ago, but I think, after doing some research and reading a lot of books, I found (not invented obviously) a good way to search for investments. DON’T TAKE THIS AS FINANCIAL ADVICE AND ALWAYS DO YOUR RESEARCH.

***Screen for possible investments***

**Market capitalization:** 100million to 2.5billion is the perfect range, but it is not a problem if the company is worth 80million or 3billion (just if I want to create a screener, I’d put in this range).

**Enterprise Value to EBITDA:** This is in my opinion one of the best ratios to compare companies within an industry. Search below the industry average, and if possible, under 9 (This is in my opinion one of the best factors to compare companies within an industry)

**Price to Book value:** Everyone knows this ratio and you should definitely check it before you invest in a company. Screen for below 0.8 (I consider this one of the most important factors)

**Price to Earnings:** The classic value ratio should be below 7.5 (this is not completely necessary, because it is possible to invest in companies who do not have positive earnings, but if they are profitable, then look for the ones with under 7.5 pe)

**Volume:** How much attention has this company from active traders? Screen for over 250k if you care about this; even though this is not a very important factor I wanted to include it as it still plays some role for short term plays.

**Debt to Equity:** How much in debt is this company? Screen for below 0.5 if you want to play it a bit more safely. If you are willing to take more risk this ratio is not important.

**Altman Z-Score:** what is the possibility that the company is going bankrupt (Margin of Safety)

**Technical Analysis:** Stock should be massively depressed over the 5y period (down more than 40% is perfect). This gives you a bit playground to see where the stock was and could be again if investors agree with your analysis. But in the end this has nothing to do with the value of a stock. Still most of the time the depressed stocks are the most discounted ones.

**Insider Buying:** This can be of great importance, especially if the stock is going through a depression, as it shows confidence of the management. But! Make sure that you don’t get played by the management, as they might only buy it to make it seem safer. I mostly look for cluster buys of over 250k and from executives. You can find it at Open Insider.

**Owners Earnings**\*\*:\*\* This is the classic calculation of Warren Buffett and I think it is useful to compare it to the company’s normal net income.

**Put to Call:** This shows you how funds think about the stock. Below 0.5 is great. You can find it if you google it or on Whale Wisdom.

**CAGR (Net Income or Revenue):** How was the historical performance of the company

**Price to Sales:** This is an indicator of value which is popular, and I often put much value on it. I like it if a stock is trading below 0.6.

**Confidence:** Make a range between 1-6. By doing this you don’t make the mistake of overrating something or underrating it. It is very important to have a good feeling about an investment.

**Phantasy:** Here comes the wisdom of Kostolany into play. The phantasy can be sometimes of importance as it not only is more fun, but it shows you again how confident you are. (Btw, Kostolany says a bit alcohol while investing is good so let’s go, we even got an excuse for our alcohol addiction)

***A deeper analysis (if you want to make a big investment)***

**Calculate a Fair Value to get a price target**\*\*:\*\* Use the average of a Discounted Cash Flow Model, Benjamin Graham Model, EPS Multiplier and Benjamin Graham Book Value Model. This is safer, as it combines the classic valuation techniques (I am sorry if I missed some, I am also new to investing, so please leave a comment if you know different ones).

**Read equity research reports or analyses of big investors or investment banks.**

**Look if the company is in funs which use a similar strategy (for example Scion Asset Management):** You can use Whale Wisdom for that and sometimes the fund even publishes a report about the company which you should probably read.

**Look at the complete industry outlook:** Look at industry reports of others or do your own (that takes a long time though).

**Look at the rationality of the Management:** Background, Executive Compensation, strategy, and risk management

**History, Innovation and Competition**

**Risks:** How much risk is there? Does the company approach these risks correctly?

**Look at reports on Seeking Alpha to get more insight.**

I think if you take the time to make the complete analysis like I described it, you can find great investments. What is missing? The simplicity of the business or the greatness of the business is not analyzed. For long term plays, I would definitely look at the business model, dividends, and others, like Buffett would urge you to do it. For short term plays, a good method could be the very indebted companies, as they sometimes squeeze, but those are the most difficult companies to analyze without making big mistakes. For the mid term investments (2 months to 2 years) I think the analysis I described here is worth considering, but always make safe investments.

I know that my article is probably full of mistakes but please forgive me I also am new, and I just wanted to share my thoughts. I also want to say that Buffett and Munger are still the greatest investors and if you find a way to do something similar, I applaud you.

&amp;#x200B;

[Daily chart going back to the beginning of 2021](

These are the horizontal lines I've decided to use. As we can see from the most recent price action we broke through $11.20 USD, retraced under it, and has been hovering around there that point today. This confirms the belief that this is a line of significance because of prior price action where we had a bounce off \~$11.20 at the end of the first bull run in January, as well as a few days of intermittent support/resistance days in between then and now.

&amp;#x200B;

[Daily chart of the last couple months](

What is even more interesting to me is not only are we acting on this number as support/resistance in the last 5 trading days, on todays daily low we actually bounced off the 50 DMA. A small, bull pennant has also been formed in these few days by producing these higher highs and higher lows.

RSI in the healthy range, and is respecting the Bollinger bands.

&amp;#x200B;

[1 hour chart. A better picture of the pennant.](

&amp;#x200B;

Higher highs, higher lows. Creation of a bull pennant. Anticipating a possible break out tomorrow morning.

&amp;#x200B;

[Weekly chart](

These higher highs and higher lows should come to no shock to us, BB has been in an overall bull trend since the beginning of 2020. and following this bottom trendline.

As a small side note, I do not know how accurate this top trend line is. This could be a large descending wedge pattern, but it's not possible to predict anything with only two points of the top of the wicks. The next run up will paint a better picture.

Prediction - Large price movements within the next week. GME + AMC are already moving as well.

For traders, I would recommend waiting for a volume spike of 20+ million trades in a day. $BB is already trending upwards with relatively low volume and the bottom appears to be in.

Volume spike is the only confirmation needed now for a bull run.

TL;DR -  
Bullish reasons:  
\- Bull Pennant, descending wedge, large respect to the bottom trendline, holding above $11.20 line of significance, broken out of the downward channel, large pop off the 50dma today. Large respect to the Bollinger bands. Financials coming soon, might give insight into patent sale. RSI healthy.

Bearish reasons:  
\-Needs volume spike or there will be no large movement. \*THIS BEING SAID WE ARE STILL IN A LARGE UPTREND. I AM ONLY SAYING THIS FOR MY PREDICTION FOR A LARGE MOVEMENT SOON\*  
\-Financials may not have any insight to the patent sale. If there's no good patent sale money or information, these financials will be shit unless you guys all bought 10 copies of Cyclance to your friends and family.

Position:  
2000 shares.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, on the Weekly chart we have Hidden Bullish Divergence on the MACD Indicator. (Higher low on the price with a lower level of negative momentum on the indicator) It's a strong sign that sellers are exhausted.

Up here is a tightly wound time bomb. TTCF (Tattooed Chef) is a wildly asymmetric bet with an options IV that is drastically underpricing the risk of trapped shorts closing one another out with a fun catch: the higher IV goes, the more shorts lose.

&amp;#x200B;



I’ve been watching this the past 2 weeks, and now have some hard examples of shorts using illegal methods of delaying the inevitable: an explosive move up from broker close outs and spiking short constraints. I’m confident in the move happening imminently, so will hit out the hard points asap.

**Quick summary below on TTCF**

\- **Outstanding revenue** **growth** (up 52% yoy) outweighed tax liability loss for Q2 

\- **Short borrow rate spike to 200% to 300%** is one of the highest rates I’ve ever seen

\- **Short interest at 61%** of actionable float &amp; 37% of entire float

\- **FTD panic reset-the-clocks** are rampant 

\- **SEC Reg SHO List** limits broker-short deal ability

\- **Float constrained** to 24mil 

\- **Increasing IV and price catalyst** for short capitulation

&amp;#x200B;

[They done messed up](

# Part 1 about

Tattooed chef creates sustainable vegetarian/vegan foods and sells them to various chains and grocery stores. Think Blue Apron for millennials without delivery costs. Good food, better profits. [From their 10Q]( They’re estimating close to $240mil in revenue for 2021, have $140mil of cash on hand (read: no dilution concerns), and have a gross margin of 13%. No wonder institutions increased holdings to nearly 20%. Honestly, a pretty solid company; CEO’s a cool dude, too.

&amp;#x200B;

[Bloomberg Institution rates](

So why the big drop? 

Turns out there was a tax deferment payment (read: loss) of $47.22mil they disclosed on Q2 ER on Aug 12. My theory is shorts were happening for a much larger drop, but also turns out the market didn’t care since the company is reporting solid growth and will continue to. 

Even after insiders were allowed to sell in April, the CEO only dropped 2.5% of his entire stake. 

Cue: buy the fucking dip and tightening of the float.

&amp;#x200B;

[High frequency also price levels based on gaps\/hedging\/stops](

Here’s where it gets fun, during the small rally last week back to balance, cost to borrow increased x3 fold. Shorts not only did not close, but increased their positions. AKA all those shorts who opened up are now trapped.

&amp;#x200B;

[Ortex + IBKR borrow rates](

# Part 2 massive short constraints

A quick look at the options tape can tell you all you need to know about how deep the shorts are (see part 3) but if you want the numbers, here they are:

**Float**: 40mil (Bloomberg)

**Institutions**: 15.6mil (Bloomberg)

**SI:** 15mil (Ortex)

**Trading float:** 24.4mil

**SI of trading float: 61% (not counting shorted shares)**

TTCF is peculiar because in every case of a spiked 100% utilization (the broad availability of shares to short) there’s a corresponding rally in price. We’re there again but this time there’s a twist.

&amp;#x200B;

[Utilization in yellow, borrow rate in purple, 100&amp;#37; utilization highlighted](

Not only do I expect a high utilization rally 25-50% higher than current prices, we now have significant number of added short constraints prompting a higher move. 

Listing them out - in addition to the utilization HTB rally, we now have 1) a smaller float due to institutional buys, 2) crazy high CTB rate of 220-340%, 3) reg SHO forcing close outs of recent FTD shorts, and 4) higher accruing losses the higher IV goes. 

The excessive short borrowing results in issues with clearing houses and brokers – namely, these firms are loaning out shares they don’t have. [Enter the SEC and the regulation SHO list](

&amp;#x200B;

[Reg SHO Threshold List](

# Part 3 reset the clock… right?

Well, they can try. Let’s have a primer. What is an FTD (Fail-To-Deliver) and resetting the clock?

&gt;Periodically, securities become hard to borrow, and, where there are large and persistent fails to deliver in the security, end up on the threshold security list. These situations give rise to pricing differentials in the options of these securities, and the Put/Call equation may appear out of balance, which is, in part, a reflection of higher borrowing rates on these securities…. Reg SHO requires FTD positions resulting from short sale transactions to be closed out by a specific date (T+3).

\- [SEC Illegal Reset Report]( page 6 (2013)

Okay in English, FTD’s are when brokers can’t deliver short sales. They normally have to close them on T+3. In order to avoid closing, Short Bears are doing something called ‘Resetting the Clock’ to kick the ball down the road before closing out and paying 340% borrow fees. 

Here’s a walk-thru on the reset playbook.

1. Short Bear shorts TTCF at 340% cost to borrow to try for a 5% gain. Yolo.
2. Crooked Broker can’t deliver the borrowed shares.
3. Crooked Broker is required to close out Short Bear on the third day (T+3).
4. Short Bear doesn’t like this so they do a sneaky deal selling calls and buying puts on non-OI options with Crooked Broker so they assign them making it look like they closed out for another 3 days. 
5. Short Bear hopes price goes down before he has to pay the 340% cost to borrow + take the loss, so keeps doing this.

What Short Bear is doing is illegal, so in the off chance the SEC ever does anything, here’s your proof (cc: SEC)

&amp;#x200B;

[Thursday Order, 12:18pm CST](

&amp;#x200B;

[Friday OI – options have all been exercised](

These resets have been happening literally every day for the past week. So, why should you care? Well, the SEC tells us why.

&gt;Trade A continues to execute a buy-write reset transaction whenever necessary, and by the time of expiration of its original Reversal, it may have given up some of the profits in the form of premiums paid, but it has maintained its short position without paying the higher cost to borrow or purchase shares to make delivery.

\- [SEC Illegal Reset Report]( page 9

Read: the longer shorts do this, the higher IV goes = the longer shorts do this, the more and more unprofitable it becomes. Not only does A) this clock reset point to severe short constraints, but B) this represents severe vulnerability if the powder keg goes off and mass calls get bought, jacking IV/premium, making the FTD reset dramatically more expensive and complex to complete while sparking off a short squeeze.

Enter: vicious cycle

1. Price goes higher, forcing high borrow rates
2. Shorts with high borrow rates try to reset the clock
3. Reset the clock jacks IV higher, making it more unprofitable
4. Shorts start closing
5. Price goes higher
6. Repeat

# Part 4 the play

The run should start imminently. 

Repeated tests of the $20 - $20.5 range result in huge panic short sells. On Thurs, shorts responded to attempted breakout by purchasing thousands of deep ITM puts and selling thousands of deep ITM calls for a stupid amount of premium. Didn’t work. On Fri, massive share sells tried to defend against another breakout.

&amp;#x200B;

[Short attacks on price Thurs-Fri](

IV is low enough to make substantial returns. It would be lower if not for shorts resetting transactions, but it’s all good because there’s ample ability to profit off their mistake. 

It you want to see what short panic looks like, look no further than the walls of bought puts and sold calls shorts placed on Thurs to prevent a breakout.

&amp;#x200B;

[Thursday Order, 8:56am CST](

My move is on all time highs. 

9/17 22.5c @ 0.6 = 800% returns by exp. at 28

9/17 25c @ 0.4 = 1150% returns by exp. at 30

10/15 25c $ .65 = 1400% returns by exp. at 35

Would you:

a) cry and throw your phone in the ocean

b) quit trading forever and kick your wife's boyfriend out of the house

or c) sell your car, sell your house and live in a cardboard box, empty your kid's college fund, get a 2nd job, heck, a 3rd job as a stripper in wall street where you will dance for analysts at Melvin capital, and put every single dollar you could possibly get your hands on into apple?

I would say 90%, and that's a conservative estimate, of people who are into stocks would choose option C. I think even Warren Buffet would move into a cardboard box next door to you and explain that sold everything he has for apple shares if it ""crashed"" by 40% or more right now.

Which brings me to my point. For those massive companies with inflated market caps to crash, there has to be some kind of Earth shattering event that would make even the diamondiest of hands afraid to touch them. Not ""hey man, apple is making me too much money, think I'm gonna sell it for some bonds instead"". I'm talking a pandemic that shuts down the whole world's economy, several gigantic banks going out of business, fucking meteors falling out of the sky, Yellowstone erupting, that's what has to happen for people to start selling their blue chipped shares and for the market to crash. It will happen from time to time, but it can't be predicted by number crunching on a chart. It has to be something concrete.

Like in 2008, the market's didn't just crash randomly, they kept rebounding back and forth until finally it became obvious to everyone that the economy was going to be pretty much destroyed by several banks collapsing. So maybe, someone could have been smart enough in early 2008 to see the potential damage those banks were going to cause by going under, decide that congress was going to be too indecisive to do anything about it, and get out before the crash. But that was the result of an event that was happening, it had nothing to do with p/e's and derivatives and chart pattern. Stocks didn't crash in 2008 because they were ""overvalued"".

TL:DR: Unless someone has a very specific reason to be afraid of a crash, not ""the fed is printing too much money"" or ""p/e's are too high"", they are totally full of it.",The markets not going to crash,52,7

All I need is $450 each month to eat, pay rent, etc. The other half is put forth by my wife/girlfriend/lover. I don't need all the money you guys are forced to make each year on the promised land. Just a note to keep in mind.

---------------------------------

Here it is, I got lucky.  I took a few loans in different ways to daytrade stocks:

- $30k
- $15k
- $8k from my girlfriend
- $5k from credit cards
- some savings from my regular job

The reason I took so many loans is that I was constantly making little money and losing (the loans were not taken all at once). At one point, I decided to put together as much money as possible and went all in on GameStop after the first squeeze.

When GameStop hit $340 the second time, I sold it all literally 5 minutes before it dipped, and made $65k.

Since that moment, I've been trading with $50k+ and it's been really easy to make money, so I decided to quit my job. After quitting, I got my hand into $25k that they had to pay me as severance.

Bottom line: I extinguished all my loans BUT $27k I owe the bank, and right now I'm trading with $65k. I figured that, considering taxes, I have to make $1500 monthly to break even (monthly expenses + loan rate). If I pay off the bank, that amount is reduced to $700 monthly expenses.

However, if I pay off the bank, my trading power will be reduced to $35k, which is insufficient, in my experience, to make money just trading stocks. So what do I do? Keep trading until those $65k become, lets say, $100k, and then pay off the bank? Or just extinguish debt and go back to trade with under $50k?

Thanks!

**EDIT 2:** some people are doubting the authenticity of this post when I say I got a severance package after quitting. Severance package here is like 401k on the US. In some European countries, you don't get a choice and some money is taken from your salary each month and deposited as ""severance package"" by the company. When you switch jobs or quit, that money is given to you. If you held a job for 10 years, you get a really nice exit bonus.

His [DD]( on Affirm was so spot on. Gems like these make WSB such an amazing place!

I will try to keep the post as concise as possible and link to verifiable sources so that the reader can research and draw conclusions on their own.

# Introduction

Lion Electric is a Canadian-based manufacturer of commercial vehicles founded in 2008. It is the North American leader in all-electric medium and heavy duty urban vehicles. It designs and assembles the vehicles in-house and is vertically integrated (from battery design and assembly, charging network, to vehicle software and monitoring).

# The Amazon angle

Let's start with the elephant in (every) room, Amazon. While Amazon is going to work with Rivian to build the last mile delivery trucks, it is going to procure up to 2,500 all-electric Lion 6 and Lion 8 trucks from Lion Electric by 2025. Amazon has a [contract]( with Lion Electric which provides for the reservation of production capacities at Lion Electric  for up to 500 e-trucks per year between 2021 and 2025. The contract order also states that Lion Electric will keep 10% of its production facility free from 2026 to 2030 to supply at least 500 electric trucks per year. Lion Electric has already delivered the first production batch to Amazon.

&amp;#x200B;

[Lion's all Electric Amazon delivery trucks ](

To get over all the negative press Amazon is getting, its focusing heavily on showing its positive environmental impact (including some desperate [efforts]( like buying Seattle's KeyArena and renaming it to Climate Pledge Arena!).

The SEC filing which Lion Electric had filed earlier this year also included an option for Amazon to purchase common shares  of Lion Electric at $5.66 and **warrants to purchase shares at $23.36**. **The  full vesting of the warrants requires spending by Amazon of at least  $1.1 billion annually. Amazon could own 20% of Lion Electric in the  future with its ownership options.**

([SEC filing]( Although most of the document is super dense, you could search for ""SCHEDULE OF TERMS OF WARRANT SHARES"")

# The Rivian connection

Coincidence that Lion Electric chose Juliet, Illinois as their manufacturing plant in USA? Less than 100 miles from Rivian's facility in Normal, IL?  ([ref](

Rivian is supposed to be delivering last mile all-electric delivery vehicles for Amazon whereas Amazon has contract with Lion for medium/heavy duty vehicles.  Amazon has supported Rivian through all its delays and remains heavily invested in it. There will be a lot of synergy &amp; partnership between Rivian and Lion Electric since Lion Electric has been in business for a long time and has many production vehicles on road. We will know more about it when Rivian SEC filings. Rivian has been in pre-production phase and will look up to its older brother for production expertise. Elon Musk has [mentioned]( time and again that prototyping is way easier than actually making production vehicles. Lion Electric has been designing and making production vehicles for quite some time and Amazon would be more than happy to take advantage of its relationship with Lion Electric to propel Rivian.

# OK so what's Lion Electric on its own?

Lion Electric has more than 400 production vehicles on road with approximately 8 million miles driven. Announced in Q2 earnings call ([ref]( it has an order book of more than $280 million dollars worth of all-electric medium and heavy duty urban vehicles. Clients include IKEA, First Student, (the largest student transportation provider in North America) who recently ordered 260 all-electric buses for pilot, LA School District etc.

&amp;#x200B;

[Lion's vehicles along with its current customers](

Lion Electric has also successfully deployed vehicle-to-grid (V2G) charging in a pilot program. This opens up potential revenue streams for its customers. Lion's buses and heavy-duty vehicles come equipped standard with V2G technology, providing opportunities for its customers to sell electricity back to the grid when demand for energy is high. ([ref](

Lion Electric is targeting a TAM of $110 billion dollars.

**Production Facilities:**

Its current factory in Montreal has a capacity to produce 2500 vehicles. It is also building a 1.6 million sq ft battery plant in Quebec, Canada with a planned annual capacity of 5 gigawatt hours aimed to power up to 14,000 Lion vehicles.

For customers in USA (\*cough\* Amazon \*cough\*), it is building USA's largest all-electric medium &amp; heavy duty vehicle plant in Joliet, Illinois, USA which is about 80% complete and will have a production capacity of 20000 vehicles.

&amp;#x200B;

[Lion's factory in IL. USA's largest all-electric medium &amp; heavy duty vehicle plant. 80&amp;#37; complete](

**Other tailwinds:**

Lion Electric has a lot of support from Canada government. Both at the state and federal level. Canada is also pushing a lot on the electric bus &amp; truck infrastructure ([ref]( In USA, although we don't have anything concrete yet, Biden's trillion dollar infrastructure bill has a lot of meat for Lion Electric and its competitors. Lion Electric also has been working very closely with local and state government authorities to sell electric school buses. Illinois gave Lion Electric $8 million incentive to setup their factory in Illinois [(ref)]( Recently, LA school district (which is the largest school district in California) also started a pilot project with Lion Electric. ([ref](

&amp;#x200B;

**Valuation:**

**$LEV is currently trading at a market cap of 2.2 B**. It is projecting $0.7 Billion revenue in 2022, $1.6 Billion in 2023 and $3.6 Billion is 2024 growing at an average rate YOY of more than 240%.

At $3.6 billion in fiscal 2024 &amp; 20,000 in annual vehicle sales, $LEV is trading at a forward 4-year price to sales revenue multiple of 0.5x.

*Meanwhile, Rivian is IPOing at 80 B valuation...*

# tl;dr

Ape thinks Lion Electric is highly undervalued (both long term and short term) given its current sales, its growth trajectory and its Amazon connections. It will go astronomical when Rivian files IPO.

**Positions:**

Long term: 200 01/20/23 15C 

Short term lottos: 100 Oct 15 15C

**Here are a few of my thoughts below:**

* Jay Monroe (CEO of $GSAT) has tried for many years to monetize the company's main asset, a 11mhz sliver of spectrum between 2.483-2.495ghz. The first iteration was something called ""Terrestrial Low Power Service - TLPS"".
   * Old $GSAT presentation covering TLPS: [
* Jay famously convinced investors in 2013-2015 that this spectrum was on the cusp FCC approval to be used as a new ""private wifi"" 802.11 extension which existing devices with wifi could use this network with only a software upgrade.
* This all turned out to be complete BS and investors lost their shirts when the FCC shot the idea down.
* Fast forward it appears [$GSAT]( has a new lease on life. Globalstar was able to get its 2.4ghz band, now designated as ""n53"" incorporated into 5G and approved for \*terrestrial\* use in 2017.
* What does that mean? [$GSAT]( spectrum can be used for ground-to-ground comms as an anchor channel for carrier aggregation or licensed assisted access (LAA) in cellular networks. It is NOT approved for satellite to terrestrial device comms.
   * [
* It's conceivable Apple is working w/ [$GSAT]( to create a ""private"" terrestrial LTE network to augment a user's existing service with AT&amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile, etc. Maybe there's confusion by association: using [$GSAT]( spectrum must mean a new LEO service!
* A few problems with this theory: 1) [$GSAT]( spectrum is approved for terrestrial use only, 2) Even if it was approved for space to terrestrial handset use, you would need powerful, large aperture satellites to talk to low power handsets and 3) Wireless carriers own the subscriber today and WON'T be letting someone else eat off their plate. You can get designed into new chipset... doesn't mean anyone will light up your spectrum.
   * Abel Avellan, the CEO of $ASTS agrees about point (2) here:[
* Also, [$GSAT]( has been very clear on terrestrial use for the n53 band:
   * [
* BE WARY of [$GSAT]( rumors. Many prior rumors have bubbled up ahead of an important financing for the company. Magically [$GSAT]( would be testing with [$AMZN]( [$DISH]( [$GOOG]( and then equity would be used to refinance maturing debt - imagine that



* Finally, Starlink fans suggesting an Apple iPhone 13 may work with its service: HIGH powered dishes are needed to communicate via Ka/Ku spectrum to Starlink's satellites. That's why the service is primarily for FIXED broadband, not a tiny mobile handset.
* Wait, how does Anpanman know so much about [$GSAT]( I was a big spectrum investor during that time and made a lot of money on Clearwire, Dish, StraightPath... however Jay Monroe turned me into a big bagholder of [$GSAT]( stock.

Reason: use of Zoom is down as much as 33% in Q2 compared to Q1. To a degree this is expected due to seasonality/return to work, but I believe it will make it difficult for them to actually improve on their Q1 with these results

Many people in countries with high vaccination rates have seen pretty dramatic drops in the popularity of the Zoom app recently:

&amp;#x200B;



**Reasons why this theory might not work out**

&amp;#x200B;

* It's already priced in
* Options      are expensive and you get theta crushed
* Most of Zoom's revenue is      subscription (monthly/annual) based, not usage or volume based. A      decrease in call volumes in Q2 doesn’t mean that their revenue/earnings actually      decreased as dramatically as I’m predicting
* Analysts were already expecting      bad results and priced them in
* Zoom releases spectacular      numbers for Zoom phone, their new product that is meant to diversify their      offerings
* Cathie      Woods might buy out the company for USD 667 per share
* Zoom is already down a lot from      its ATH, it could also see a bounce back up

BB holds over 42,000 patents and over 70% of cybersecurity ai patents!!!! They are selling of their old business patents like messaging, phones, networking wireless to likely Facebook. Once it's announced the stock should do 3-4x.

NO MORE will your wife’s boyfriend bully you for your micro-penis! After CRSR you will be rich enough to get penis-enlargement surgery and FINALLY have a dong BIGGER than his!!!

Now before you retards go gamble all your life savings on the chance to get penis-enlargement surgery, let me explain why CRSR will go TO THE MOOON

&amp;#x200B;

**First, the Fundamentals:**

Now bare with me, I know you retards don’t like fundamentals… So I will make it as short and colorful as possible!

Fundamentally, this company is one of the MOST undervalued companies I have EVER seen



CRSR has grown at 24.3% Y/Y despite chip shortages, re-openings, supply-chain shocks, commodity inflation, and last year being especially good for them cause of lockdowns

They also own Elgato which specializes in studio equipment for streamers, and Origin PC which builds custom pc’s

These two additional companies have been growing rapidly and allow CRSR to capture the whole gaming peripheral market

Despite being a well run, profitable company in a growing industry, they are priced at HALF the S&amp;P 500's P/E!



Additionally the float is only around 88M... so unlike some plays on here, WSB could LITERALLY buy the ENTIRE FLOAT

I could go on for SO much longer about why CRSR is a Deep F\*cking Value play... But since you retards have an attention-span worse than a goldfish, I will move on...

&amp;#x200B;

**Option Chains:**

Corsair has an insanely bullish options market which is primed for a Gamma Squeeze



If CRSR gets above $35.00 by 9/17, up to 2,037,800 shares will need to be purchased! This is even before WSB has gotten their greasy hands on it. I’m sure by 9/17 the open interest will be MUCH higher

Having so many options sold just OTM is PERFECT for a gamma squeeze

Additionally due to delta hedging, the more IV on options and options that go ITM, the more stocks MM's will need to buy to hedge against the options that they sold

Having so many options contracts sold on a smaller market cap stock is perfect for a gamma squeeze. IV will go through the roof once WSB buys in causing MM's to hedge creating a feedback loop

CRSR options are SUPER cheap which gives a good entry point for WSB retards, and makes it much easier to increase the open interest

&amp;#x200B;

**Short sellers:**

Over the past month, short sellers have been getting TOO greedy and have been adding a shit ton of positions around 26$. This means shorts will be underwater if the stock price increases AT ALL

CRSR has a short interest of around 24% which, albeit still large, would not be a huge issue on its own... but because most of these short positions were opened at the literal bottom, those short sellers will be much more likely to close their positions and/or be margin called

For the past few weeks, around 40% of the volume has been sold short



At the same time as shorts have been adding positions, large institutional investors have been buying in HEAVILY



This high of a short interest combined with strong financials, a bullish options market, and large institutional investors being on our side means shorts are absolutely fucked and this stock is going TO THE MOON

&amp;#x200B;

**How to Profit:**

I recommend buying a mix of 9/17 ITM/OTM calls, leaps, and shares

Buy 9/17 calls if you believe this has a chance to squeeze

Buy leaps/shares if you believe in the underlying company

&amp;#x200B;

**Positions:**

10 $27.5 C 9/17, 13 $30 C 9/17, 50 $32.5 C 9/17, 20 $35 C 9/17, 106 shares, 2 $25 2/18/22 C

# Overall Thoughts:

A great smaller growth company that really is going to beat out any competitors in the future. This is looking like a long term play for me. However, their are some squeeze potentials for the stock. So I have entered 10k position into a short term play for the stock.

**TLDR:**

* Good long term company
* Squeze Could happen in the next coming weeks or through september/October
* 10k Position of Calls expring Sept and Oct

# Squeeze Stats:

* 100% utilization
* 343% cost to borrow on average
* 8 days to cover
* tons of failures to deliver

Note: The cost to borrow doubled from Thursday to Friday.

&amp;#x200B;

**Catalyst?**: No huge catalyst. However, Lots of medium sized things.

* the charts from me eating some highlighters looks really promising. It has currently traded in a wedge pattern for the last several months, and it is looking primed to break out of the pattern. If we see a large amount of bullish volume as the pattern breaks then this could trigger a short squeeze.
* Another potential, catalyst could be the earnings report was taken poorly for no reason. As I understand they took a loss on the books and it dragged some fundementals down. However, this was due to a acquisition of another company to expand their business. So, They could have oversold and sentiment changes around the Earning Report.
* Finally, Institutional buyers. Over the last week or so, large institutions have been purchasing more and more shares of TTCF. This higher volume could start a little bit of an outbreak in the stock
* Additionally, small CAP's are on a huge rally right now. The IWM could actually just pull this up with it and the DXY is signally a risk on market. (insignificant stuff)

&amp;#x200B;



**Dilution Scare?:** Company has diluted before. However, that was to purchase a large one time acquisition of another company. It is highly unlikely that this will happen again because the CEO owns 39% of the company and another large group owns roughly 9% of the company making it less likely that a share dilution will occur.

**Overview of Company:**

Tattooed Chef is a plant-based food brand. They are available in stores like Target, Walmart, Costco, and Sam's Club. The company is entirely vertically integrated which gives them a massive edge of the competition. They have been building manufacturing infrastructure since 2010. This company has great growth potential and is rapidly expanding. You might be thinking to yourself right now I'm tired of this plant based shit I don't even care if the burger is still Moo'ing on the plate, but hang with me this industry is experiencing huge growth as the younger generations eat this stuff up.

 

**Pro's of Company:**

* Great review on the food
* Already have tons of shelf space allocated towards them in walmart, costco, and Sams
* Innovative
* Growing popularity of plant based diets
* Banger of a CEO Salvatore ""Sam"" Gallett working in the food industry for over 35 years now.
* Daughter is cheif design
* Planning to go into overseas markets (europe mainly) to expand in the future.
* Great growth
* good fundementals
* Increasing Gross margins

&amp;#x200B;

**Con's**

* Competition of the Sector
   * not a ton of competition right now, but not alot stopping other companies
* Poor sentiment for some reason.

Maybe you heard about their tech crackdown. 

But did you know BABA as we know it on the NYSE isn't actually the proper company stock? It's a holding company located in the Cayman islands created specifically to skirt Chinese regulations while earning US investment capital. 

Basically you're trading BABA not for shares of the company but for contracts of shares. Something China is likely looking to ban next as they continue their crackdown on the private sector. 

Why? 

The CCP likes having power. They can't have people become as wealthy as Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk because that is a threat to their Government authority. So why will they continue to allow companies like BABA or JD(dot)com to acquire MORE money from foreign investors? 

They won't. 

China is going to tighten the noose on these loopholes such as VIE structured stocks, if not to consolidate power, to encourage investors to use *their* market instead of the US NYSE. 

China has been more than happy to allow such loopholes to exist while they have been developing. However the current trend seems to be putting them at odds with the West and US interests more now than ever before....and they are more comparable to Western powers than ever before. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the question is now this. Are we only in this for the profits? Are we selling out by investing in ALMOST criminal Chinese enterprises that are setup for the singular purpose of getting YOUR money without benefiting the foreign investor? How do we know China's government isn't forcibly allocating their profits to its own war-chest for state use? What are you really contributing your money to? 

&amp;#x200B;

Just food for thought. I'm pulling my money out of every ""holding company"" stock just for this reason. Even though I'm retarded, I still want to invest in something I support. And I don't believe buying BABA is truly only benefiting their company.

I get it Papa Xi wants to fuck Jack Ma but what beef does he or the CCP have with BIDU? Are they as in danger as $BABA, Or are they just dipping out of collateral damage?

A P/B of 2 when some of these companies are in the teens. With a solid EPS. Plus solid institutional ownership. 

Consensus buy ratings. One of the top AI and internet companies in the world. Hype around breaking into EV sector. They’re buying up market share and breaking into new areas with purchases like when they bought $YY for $3.6 billion to compete in live streaming. Average price target of $250 even with all this CCP shit going on.

Doesn’t it seem like the CCP is mainly going after companies like Tencent and Baba because they have huge ties to America? To me it seems like the CCP and BIDU have mutually beneficial relationship, without access to Chinas market BIDU is dead and with that leverage the CCP get access to their biggest search engine provider to collect data on its citizens etc. 

TLDR; Is $BIDU the better play than $BABA?

I know my fellow apes dont like this ticker but hear me out. I wanna understand the technical and weird shit happening with this stock. So if someone knowledgeable could enlighten me, I would really appreciate.

Disclaimer: I am not trying to pump or convince you guys to invest rather trying to understand this shit. I have no positions as of now but am considering opening a big position in this week. I had my losses earlier from this stock but looking for a re-entry.

TL;DR: Shorts are going crazy, things dont make sense, potential buyout opportunity? Can someone explain? Is there a Kong among us?

As I understand there is something brewing with this stock/company. Recently Icahn's (IEP) former executive Dan Ninivaggi got appointed as the CEO of this almost doomed company. The short interest was already at 32% (35M) as of Aug 13 with big players like Citadel, BoFA, GS increasing their short positions as of Aug 17. The SP was around $5.5 and went to ATL of $4.77 on Aug 19. With the news annoucement the shares shot up 40% to $7.4 with volume of 137M on Aug 26. That volume is higher than the 111M float shares of the stock. Fintel reports almost 59% short volume on that day. The SP came down to \~$6.5 and is holding this level which was last on July 29. Therefore it seems like the shorts after July 29 are stuck in loss with this stock and potentially have shorted more when it spiked up. There are \~2M fails to deliver reported at $6.2.

So can someone explain how 59% of short volume happened on a day where the trading volume was higher than the float size and 32% of float are already shorted? Did the big players covered their position? But if they did, wouldn't the SP have rocketed higher and why did it come down?

Another research Ive been doing is looking into IEP. In the last decade or so, IEP has bought several billion dollar businesses in auto repair and auto fleet industry. Dan Ninivaggi was appointed CEO/Executive position in many of them at some point in time of the acquistion. IEP is missing an auto manufacturer in their arsenal of companies. So it seems there's a potential of acquistion here considering RIDE market cap is just around a billion dollars as of now and RIDE is repeatedly claiming late september limited production start with early 2022 deliveries.

So would IEP have a better entry position that this? Would RIDE market cap go even lower if they start production on the promised time?

Thank you

HP is a performance-driven drilling solutions and technologies company based in Tulsa, Oklahoma with operations in all major U.S. onshore oil and gas producing basins as well as South America and the Middle East. They operate under four reporting segments, North America Solutions (Largest segment), Offshore Gulf of Mexico, International Solutions (South America &amp; UAE) and Other. (Small real estate holdings) The current market price is a significant discount to intrinsic value considering the company’s strategic alignment with technology through performance contracts, ability to innovate in an industry slow to adopt, fortified balance sheet, and history of conservative management by a dynamic team. Risks to this company are largely overstated and based on the claim that oil and gas will soon be replaced by green initiatives. The world is slowly trending toward renewable energy, yet it will be many decades before this has a material impact on oil demand. The nature of this companies’ business is very volatile since it is largely dependent on oil prices. This would be worrisome if the company were not conservatively managed. I believe that the company will be worth significantly more in the future as rig activity levels continue to increase due to the price of oil remaining relatively stable. H&amp;P will continue to increase in value as E&amp;Ps are slowly starting to increase CapEx budgets.

**Alignment of Automation Technology with Performance Contracts** 

Traditionally HP (and the industry as a whole) has used the day rate model. This model charges a fixed rate per rig per day for the duration of the drilling contract. The new performance-based contracts (first talked about in the Q418 earnings call and implemented in the subsequent Q) charge a base rate and specify bonus payments if key performance indicators are met. Key performance indicators are metrics pertaining to qualitative as well as quantitative drilling factors. These factors are specified when the contract is signed and can vary depending on the customers goals. As of Q2 2021 30% of all US Land contracted rigs were under some type of performance agreement. This number is up from only 10% in Q2 2020. Historically, this industry is slow to embrace change, as seen with the initial roll out of the first Super Spec rigs and Flex 3 Legacy rigs before that. However, customers will continue to increasingly prefer H&amp;P performance contracts because of the value added. This increased adoption is margin accretive for H&amp;P because of the company’s investments in automation technology such as Motive, MagVar, and most importantly, AutoSlide. AutoSlide replaces the directional driller at rig side and lands the bit in the zone faster and more efficient than a human ever could. As previously stated, the industry is slow to adopt change, yet AutoSlide has seen continuously increased adoption since it was first introduced to beta testing in Q4 2018. AutoSlide is now found on 25% of all active H&amp;P rigs. The alignment of auto tech and the ""pay for what you get"" business model is value added for customers and shareholders alike. 

**Titan of a Balance Sheet Built by a Conservative Management Team**

The company has been managed conservatively since it was founded and remains so today. It sports a best-in-class debt to capital of 12.2%. It recently ended Q3 2021 with $553mn in cash and STI. (While only having long term debt of $481mn) It also has a revolving credit facility of $750mn which is undrawn. This brings total liquidity to $1.3bn. On March 31, 2020, it cut dividends to $0.25 per share from $0.71 per share to remain agile in the COVID oil crisis environment. As rig activity continues to increase (rig count up 10% in Q3 over Q2) I think the board may consider raising the dividend back to pre-covid levels. The current CEO, John Lindsey, has been at the head since 2014 and has been a career employee since 1987. During the Covid oil demand crisis, the management team quickly cut costs and restructured to maintain agility. As such, the business has continued to generate considerable operating cashflow, a trend that I believe will eventually return to pre covid averages of roughly half a billion dollars annually. 

Shares were up about 10% on friday due to the expectation of a supply imbalance from hurricane ida causing the price of oil to increase. This is just temporary noise. The real value is in the long term recovery.

The only thing that matters seems to be predicting what the federal reserve will do.

None of this makes sense to me as a young investor. By literally every marker we are in the biggest market bubble of all time, and many experts are talking about it. Yet this is somehow just the new status quo.

It's no longer about investing in how good the actual economy is doing, is it? I mean if you were sitting there in summer of 2019 before the virus started to become known, and I came to you in the future telling you there would literally be lockdowns and economic shutdown, what would you do?

You would sell many of your investments, maybe even short the market. Warn people of what's to come. This is the rational decision, isn't it? Things go up, and they also go down. What the hell has happened?

But actually the federal reserve decided to prop up the markets at the expense of savers and the dollar itself... so what was the point of speculating on the economy? It didn't even matter that we had a literal pandemic (or atleast the response of one), asset prices just went up and up. Imagine that was you, shorting on literal visions of future events, and still losing because the recession got cancelled.

Which leaves me very confused. Obviously you can't just create wealth out of nothing, there is always a downside to QE and that is inflation (more specifically, loss of purchasing power).

What the hell happened to the markets, how did we let it get this bad? Why would the fed not use QE to turn a crisis into a less painful downturn, instead of creating so much new money that they somehow turn a shutdown into a bull market?

Am I going crazy here? We read the statements made on Friday and the Federal reserve STILL is scared to stop pumping money into the market. But nobody's doing anything about it. How did things get this bad? No bubble resolves sideways. This is no longer investing, this is gambling, or something far worse.

I don't know how any of you can be excited about a ""bull market to come"". Sure the amount of dollars your portfolio is worth may go up... but at what cost to the dollar itself? *You are literally just gambling on whether or not the federal reserve wants to prop up a bull run on top of a propped up bull run, or they decide to let the market correct*",Is this really all there is to the market?,798,8

IT’S VINCE MCMAHON WITH A STEEL CHAIR !!! 

Yes Mr McMahon is back with another terrible terrible idea. The rumours are that the majority of their indie roster NXT will be released, triple H will be replaced as the man in charge and it will be changed into a more family friendly heavyweight show (the recent change in logo confirms a change is coming). NXT was one of the most loved aspects of WWE and the only foot in they had with many wrestling fans. 

So puts on WWE right? Surely? 

Not just yet, a referee backstage (Mike chioda) has revealed he’s heard rumours that WWE may be making their program more family friendly to sell to Disney.

((

Now while this is probably terrible for wrestling it’s great for profits, the house of mouse is only ever involved in making money and is a huge bull flag to investors. 

If these rumours are true I think a sale could happen within 6 months and the stock may climb during that time as larger firms find out about the potential.

Despite this fact it has only created 2 good trades, other triggers ended up as false starts or balks.

8/24 there was a midday alert that had gone off. The break of $40 was the new trigger.

[consolidation zone and subsequent break](

Volume instantly came in and because of the unique structure of this stock i manage it slightly different than i do the others. The main difference is that i am willing to scale out of my position rather than trail for one exit, the reason for it is the exaggerated rotation of the float and the rogue wave like volume increases. In other words AMC is ironically the only stock where my hands are in diamond form for the least amount of time.

The price point on the chart i was most interested in was the level just under 50. It was noted to be a significant area of price and volume. I was very confident that if this level were to break we would be seeing a major moon run as the imbalance of supply and demand above this point would be near its most extreme.

[trade entry and target](

&amp;#x200B;

Bruce Lee said ""Hands like water"" .... No not really, he said "".something ...something ...something..be like water"" a parallel quote we find in our game is "" Strong opinions weakly held"" the quote has been attributed to many traders so i haven't verified the source, though i did first hear it in one of the market wizards book and it has stuck with me. If Bruce was a trader i believe he'd say ""true dat"".. Once that target was hit i used it to scale and to adjust my stops. Once the market closes i resume my diamond hand status until the price action tells me different.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[The days signal to remain paper handed](

I was disappointed when AMC could not break that level on day 2, i really wanted to see this MOON, but the market doesn't give a flying F$%# what any of us wants, it takes money from us on our birthdays, it drops a 300m share offering on the day of our grandma's funeral and would rip our faces off even if our dog got hit by a garbage truck. So what do you do? you F#$% it back by hitting and running, and guess what ,Trillions of dollars are moved very week, you could rip a million dollars from it and it wouldn't skip a beat. It will forget about you by the bell. 

[The only real truth](

&amp;#x200B;

Day 2 i was stopped out pretty quickly. There was a gut check when the stock rallied back towards the high. The best part was i had an order ready to get back in, it wasn't filled and the stock fizzled out of favor. The most important thing in this game is hit and don't get hit, win more than you lose and move on.

[Asymmetric risk  \(spelling error, not fixing\)](

&amp;#x200B;

This trade wasn't the biggest, but it was a clear example of asymmetric risk and not letting expectations guide your decisions or alter your system. Even though it had a 1R profit result, it was open 2R in less than 1 hour and it had the potential of really opening up and paying us all.

SKLZ is a mobile tournament platform. Basically, they take competitive mobile games, and create some sort of tournament experience for those games with a prize pool. They provide this service through an API (application program interface). Basically, their product goes like this:

1. They create the software for hosting tournaments with prize pools
2. They offer the software to mobile game companies as an easy-to-implement solution
3. Mobile game companies implement tournaments using their software
4. They take a cut of the total prize pool every time a tournament is hosted with their software

It is extremely important to note that SKLZ’s product is only this tournament software package. They do not develop any mobile games themselves and are entirely reliant on 3rd parties to choose to use their software.

# The mobile gaming market

Mobile gaming accounts for over 50% of all video gaming revenue worldwide. In the US, one of the largest gaming markets in the world, mobile gaming revenue reached \~$11B in 2020. It’s expected that the global share of mobile gaming will continue to rise even in relation to the rest of global gaming growth.



&amp;#x200B;

In the US specifically, there has been an increased in global mobile gaming revenue share. Over the years, it has overtaken Japan as the largest mobile gaming market globally.



&amp;#x200B;

**Demographics**

The demographics of mobile gaming has been rapidly changing over the years and, especially in the US, is no longer what one would traditionally expect. For example, children and young adults aged 16-24 no longer make up the majority of mobile gamers. In fact, over a third of all mobile gamers are aged 45+. Furthermore, while 66% of men play mobile games, 70% of women play mobile games. Market research into gaming and spend indicate that older adults spend both more money and time in video games.



&amp;#x200B;

Thus, the most valuable demographic for mobile gaming is actually the female aged 45+ market.

&amp;#x200B;

**Popular game trends**

The most popular category of games is the “hyper-casual” games where users download ten times more games in that category than average. The most profitable mobile games in North America are actually puzzle games capturing 22% of the total North American mobile gaming revenue. AR (augmented reality) /Location-based games represent the smallest market in terms of North American revenue at (2.83%).



&amp;#x200B;

# Where SKLZ stands

**The bull case**

SKLZ is appropriately positioned to capture the correct demographic of gamers for the highest revenue. According to their 10-K, over 50% of their users are 45+ with \~10% of their users being aged 18-25. Furthermore, the majority of their users are women.

Beyond that, gamers who use the SKLZ platform are spending more time on the game or other SKLZ games than on TikTok, Facebook, or YouTube. They spend over 3x the amount of time they would spend on a SKLZ game than an average mobile game!

They are still on track for their India expansion which represents a massive injection of revenue possible. Furthermore, SKLZ is attempting to expand out of card games and into racing, shooting, and battle-royale type games as well.

Lastly, SKLZ’s current per-user revenue has increased by over 60%. They are successfully monetizing their current user-base and increasing the amount of revenues they gain from that user-base.



&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The bear case**

Most recently in Q2 2021, nearly three-quarters of SKLZ’s revenues comes from just 3 games: Solitaire Cube, 21 Blitz, and Blackout Bingo. In general, a handful of games has contributed to the majority of SKLZ’s revenues and this has remained consistent over the past 5 years! This represents a significant risk as it shows that SKLZ is not able to innovate away from its cash cows and as the mobile games grow out of popularity, SKLZ will not have any way to make up for lost revenues.

SKLZ is paying record amounts of money in terms of customer acquisition through marketing. However, their monthly active users is actually dropping from 2020 to 2021. In fact, SKLZ has currently spent more in marketing than the previous year’s total revenues! Yet, they are losing users. This is extremely worrisome about SKLZ’s ability to continue their rapid growth.

Lastly, SKLZ has currently only proven its market in a small segment of the mobile market. SKLZ, by definition of its platform, must operate in player vs. player games (one of the most unpopular categories of mobile gaming) which accounts for around 15% of the market. Furthermore, SKLZ has only proven itself in the arcade gaming market which accounts for 5% of North America’s revenue market. In general, SKLZ has only proven themselves in a sliver of the mobile gaming market.

&amp;#x200B;

# The financials

**Income statement**

Revenue growth in SKLZ continues to be extremely impressive, doubling every year (and on track to double again this year).



&amp;#x200B;

However, we are also seeing marketing costs increase at more than the rate of revenues which is an extremely worrisome rate. Marketing has increased spend by over 100% per year and are on track to far exceed that this year.



&amp;#x200B;

This is especially worrisome as it means that SKLZ is spending more dollars in marketing than its receiving back because of the marketing. Also, because this is a multi-year trend, it doesn’t look like marketing is paying off even in the long term. As a result, SKLZ is losing money at an increasing rate every year.



&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Balance sheet**

SKLZ sports a decently healthy balance sheet. It has over $700M in current assets with only $125M of current liabilities. This leaves SKLZ with $575M of additional cash or other liquid assets to operate with. While this is a lot of money, SKLZ is on track to burn over $300M in net losses in 2021 which will reduce this amount by over one half. Furthermore, the reason SKLZ has such a high current asset is because it has already sold additional stock in order to finance its operations. In 2021, SKLZ raised over $400M by offering new stock.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cash flow**

SKLZ has awful cash flows due to it burning money through its operations. It’s only positive cash flow over the past few years has been through financing, which means that SKLZ survives only by offering additional shares and using that money in its operations.



This should be a glaring red flag for any current investor in SKLZ.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Outlook

SKLZ has an interesting position to capture a high value demographic within the mobile gaming market. However, they are doing so within the smallest categories that are popular within their demographic. They have the ability to expand into other categories, but as they are not a mobile game development company, they aren’t able to deliberately expand into other types of games. They must depend on 3rd party developers choosing to use their platform while developing more popular categories of games for them.

What is most worrisome for me is their cash losses and their inability to sustain their operations without additional financing activity. I would expect SKLZ to further dilute their stock (and drag down their stock price) in order to finance their operations next year as well.

Lastly, I am uncertain about SKLZ’s ability to capture other hit games beyond their current cash cows. Once more, SKLZ has little control of this as they do not build games themselves and are reliant on the market choosing them with popular games. In this way, there is a great risk that their current cash cows will get phased out due to age and the newer games will not utilize SKLZ as a platform. If that happens, SKLZ will lose 75% of its revenues.

Hurricane Ida is mere hours away from hitting the coast of Louisiana. It surprisingly strengthened as it neared landfall and is now a 155 mph Cat 4 hurricane, 1 mph short of a Cat 5, recognized by the governor as the ""strongest storm"" since 1850, even worse than Katrina. It went from a tropical depression on Aug 24th to a whole hog cat 5 hurricane this morning. Most people didn't have any time to wrap their brains around how quick this happened, if you're in New Orleans please gtfo asap.

Possible Trades :

1- A bunch of offshore drilling takes place in the gulf and with a storm this destructive, production will take a hit. Companies already cut 60-90% of production and shut down offshore facilities in the gulf. oil futures are already up. You can leverage this by buying calls on SPDR S&amp;P Oil &amp; Gas Exploration &amp; Production ETF $XOP or playing the levered oil ETF $GUSH.

2- People run out to buy a whole lotta stuff from generators to plywood, sandbags, batteries, flashlights etc. You can leverage this by buying calls on Home Depot $HD,  Lowe's $LOW and Generac Holdings $GNRC which sells generators. All three popped after hurricane irma and harvey in the past.

3- People tend to need to rent a whole lot of stuff during and after big storms like this, from cars, to equipment and machinery. You can leverage this by buying calls on the AVIS Budget group $CAR and United Rentals $URI which rents out all sorts of equipment and gets a boost from every hurricane season as well. These popped after major hurricanes hit last 3-4 hurricane seasons.

Best potential moves :

1- Oil seems like it's going to be the biggest play, as \~40% of all oil production and refining takes place in and around the gulf. \~92-88% of oil and gas production in the gulf of Mexico is already shut down as of yesterday and storm damage will inevitably limit future production which means a spike in oil prices. I'll be looking for a good entry to $XOP and potentially open call spreads 2-3 weeks out and cash out at a spike in oil prices any day within that timeframe. If you can trade futures options, might be a good idea to buy calls on crude oil and oil products.

2- $URI and $GNRC could see a sizable swing in the weeks following the storm, they nearly always do after big storms, so keep your eyes peeled on those. These could be good for a monthly call or call-spread position.

So Dirk set up an investment fond, the infamous ""Dirk Müller Premium Fond"". Since 2010 Dirk talked about a big crash coming up and so he started to hedge all his positions. The costs to hedge his positions are so high that they have been destroying all gains. (thats why id like to call him the WSB Antichrist, because he is absolutely protected against any risk) 

This brings us to the glorious performance of his fonds: 

[Honestly i think its quiet remarkable to have a negative performance during the last 3 years. That could be seen as an actual talent.](

So everyone is a genius in a bull market? no, a single german investment guru defied this logic.

Oh and he also talked about wirecard beeing a bulletproof stock in an interview... may he become an international investing meme!!!

July 2021 was the first time margin debt decreased since March 2020.

# TLDR:

As analysts, we can always point out the bad things in a company, but the hard part in the market, is to find value where others do not. This comes with a caveat though, because it is not enough to think different, we also need to be right when others are wrong, and it is quite hard to be right against the market.

There are at least three options (or a combination of them), which AMC has, in order to revitalize the business and sustain the current $21b market cap:

* Get a technology or streaming company to acquire the business and improve with their help
* Shrink the business and operate theaters that have been or are the most profitable
* Improve the business by digitalization, attuning to local specifications of clients, and trying out other screening activities like e-sports, gaming etc.

The full article with fundamental analysis: [

# The ideas for improvement:

The **first** option is acquisition, so let's get that out of the way. This involves a large streaming competitor coming in, and introducing a hybrid business model between streaming and cinema. They would benefit from using the AMC brand name, a positive PR move, and giving their audience a chance to buy cinema tickets for their favorite shows from their platform. Assuming the acquirer does machine learning right, they might be able to use their statistics to show movies that will generate more revenues.

Acquisitions are very risky, and hard to get right. But it might give shareholders the chance to profit on their investment. In some sense, they are buying the favor of the many people that still hold the stock, which may be worth something on its own.

Just imagine what would happen to the stock price if someone announced they want to buy the company.

The **second** option I will propose is a bit opposite to what management has been promoting lately. Instead of expanding, AMC should look at shrinking to value. 

AMC has a lot of theaters in the U.S. and worldwide. The company has some 14 thousand employees. It stands to reason, that not all of these outlets have the same profitability. There is a good chance that management knows very well which theaters are the most profitable, and can consider maximizing value by cutting out the costly ones.

This will make the company more manageable, less risky and more profitable. It will also cut expenses and make cinema a more exclusive activity.

The **third** option concerns the business model. It is obvious that the company needs to digitalize better - even their main website has some basic bugs that are annoying (some automated guide that cannot be turned off). But the main question is: Is there some alternative way of utilizing theater capacity, that is perhaps cheaper, and will attract more guests?

While it differs among cultures, cinema has been a way to spend leisure time with friends, family and loved ones. If AMC has a specific type of customer that is more prone to going to their theaters, it might consider extra activities that are specifically catered to that type of guest. Perhaps it can do some A/B testing for the ambient and figure out what works on a local level. It can also offer some more supplementary products, like selling board games or quick photo snaps for guests by a professional photographer as part of their AMC experience. 

Alternatively, it may try offering some alternative media on the big screen, like e-sports, gaming runs, or movie auctions by popular demand. The last one simply means that people have a local movie wish-list and get notified of a screening once enough people express interest.

Finally, whatever the game plan is, shareholders need to know it. It is on management to paint a clear path to profitability for the company - it does not need to happen tomorrow, but investors need to know what to expect on the long term.","With all the negative articles around, I decided to write a small thesis on how #AMC can turn things around",0,13

So, let me show you why this shit is going down.

&amp;#x200B;

[Baba Monthlys](

Here are the last 6 months of BABA'S in a nice easy to read graph. THe EMA? Going down. The volume is showing an increase in volume of sellers. The MACD is showing a nice decrease in the distance between the short and intermediate terms with it rapidly approach the zero line (meaning a cross over is coming soon! and from this the short term is going to cross over and be below the intermediate term, often a golden cross of death) with a MACD histogram that's getting stronger and stronger negatives, meaning bears are getting even more hungry and pushing that price WAAAAY down and at a growing and growing rate.

""Psy, no one cares about no monthly! Shit can change in the middle of a month!"" I mean, sure, I guess. so let's take a look at weeklies then!

&amp;#x200B;

[BABA weekly](

Oh, look, the weeklies are doing the same thing as the monthlies, with no signs of slowing down! Yay! Bears are HUNGRY since they kept getting rekt on spy. why not take advantage of some ape brains via the BABA trap? Well, This ferret says NO THANKS.""But psy! Things could change on the dailies! You're not a real psychic!"" well, I can't predict the future accurately, but let's look at the dailies to see if there's any hope of baba turning around!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Baba Dailies](

Well, here's the dailies. First thing I see is a short term ema that's below the intermediate term (that's typically a bearish signal), with not even the nice couple of green days pushing it upwards, but rather just slowing the decline. ""This histogram has been going up for the last couple of days though psy!"", and that's true. That means 1 of two things: The bears are weakening or the bulls are gaining"" and in this case, I think this is just a temporary pullback of the bears needing a moment to catch their breath before they go eating all the profits on BABA again, especially since the change in the histogram didn't really change much between friday and thursday, and it's still -1.54 (meaning the short term ema is $1.54 below the intermediate ema).

So yeah, my predictions of BABA: It's taking a minor pullback as bears get ready to go omnomnom on anyone foolish enough to fall into the BABA trap

TL;DR: Baba's monthlies are going down, Baba's weeklies are going down, and the dailies aren't showing an upward trend to show a reversal, but rather a hint of a pullback before going back into the bear wave.",$BABA is going down bagholders and bulls,53,8

3. BB
4. CLOV

Part 2. The Voice of Alex Jones

Part 3. A New Hope

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 1. Begun, the Meme Wars have**

This past week saw an appreciable awakening of the memes, particularly GME and AMC, with knock-on effects across the whole of the Meme-verse. This was followed by a sea of gain porn and concomitant conspiracy theories about insiders among us.

Well, ol' Cbass is here to clear things up with Star Wars references, bad jokes, and even worse TA. So let's have us a gander at some magic space-wizard charts to answer the age old question: ***Am I going to lose all my money.... again?***

Starting with the OG, GME:

[We're comin' fer ya, hedgies! Reee!](

According to my long since discarded thesis, GME was supposed to find support at the $218 level where the last breakout occurred (Launch #3). That failed worse than my last date, oh so many years ago. Then someone here claimed that the thin green uptrend line I've got on there was supposed to hold. That failboat sailed to a galaxy far, far away. But the #2b breakout line did, at last, managed to hold. And then we got a breakout of that nasty red downtrend this week and now we're trying, once more to breakout of the #3 line.

So, does GME have it in itself to enter hyperspace? Well, from a DD perspective earnings are coming up and that is probably going to spell doom or boom for the ticker. The company is in the midst of a turnaround, so it at least has a good story going for it (unlike anything Disney owns).

From a TA perspective... well, to be honest, TA is just there so you can feel better or worse about your decision. It can't really predict all that much, except for after the fact. But it can give traders some piece of mind before the fact; a sort of all-clear that many need before jumping in a position. To that extent, getting out from under that downtrend was a big deal. From here, it's all on the shoulders of retail to initiate **Operation Bagholder Rescue**, if it is to happen at all.

**Cbass's Call for GME:** I actually think you ~~retards~~ *brilliant, forward thinking investors* have it in you to break back over $218. Can you bust the $330 double top? I'm not so confident, but I'd be happily proven wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Next up, an empty movie theater for a Disney Star Wars showing, AMC:

[Supreme stupidity, in chart form](

My previous thesis called for AMC to retrace to the #2a line, $14.54. Whelp, y'all decided to buy up the whole damn company and proceeded to prove me wrong. But in the true form of a TA Jedi Master, I've just *ex post facto* revised my thesis so that I'm still correct: Now I'm calling the May-June launch a Double-Event, so powerful it impregnated half the girls in Bangkok, because *reasons*. Accordingly, the settling at the #2b line is right in line with my ""original"" thesis. This is how it's done, young padawan.

Having found that support, this week saw AMC also breakout of a downtrend line. I've included a small uptrend channel that I saw on some other guy's AMC TA, and we've dropped back into that. Unlike GME, there is not a significant resistance line above the current position, which is nice.

From a DD perspective, there is not much great to say about this company and ""fundamentals"" are doing nothing but holding the ticker back. Maybe if Disney hadn't fucked up Star Wars, there'd be some major films to fill the seats right now. Furthermore, management's penchant for stock sales and the possibility of more to come if you idiots actually moon this thing again *is not helping*.

**Cbass's Call for AMC:** Skies look pretty clear to me; up is the direction. I wouldn't count on that channel lasting for too long, though. On the other hand, if you wunderkinds *can't* get this thing to moon, gravity will ruin your day, week, month, year, and for some of you extra special ones: *your entire financial future*.

&amp;#x200B;

Next, a company somehow survived irrelevancy, BB:

[Extra \\""special\\"" line drawing skills here](

Just like GME, BB failed to settle at the previous breakout line (#3), and instead decided you fuckers needed the ***executive tour*** of the S&amp;M dungeon before finally settling around $9.50. BB has since broken out of *two* down trend lines! That means it's going to moon twice as hard, bro! You can readjust line #3 so it's at $11.56 or so, and then it looks like this past week's action tested and failed that line, just like was the case for GME. Indeed, from a chart-perspective GME and BB are the most closely aligned (with BBBY being a somewhat retarded cousin that ~~I've~~ *everyone has* given up talking about).

From the DD perspective, apparently BB has some magic AI shit going for it and it's related to security and cars and shit. Whatever, just sounds like Cathie Woodisms to me, but such platitudes are the nectar of the masses and if that gets 'em to buy, who fuckin' cares.

On the TA side, this is in the same boat as GME. You've got to at least break over $11.50 to stand a chance. Over that, the skies are clear for a run into the twenties and that'll be enough for the gamblers to start hurling YOLO's at it once more.

**Cbass's Call on BB**: Up if GME goes up. Sideways or down otherwise. This one's not going to move independent of Big Daddy. It's also not going to move as hard because of the large free float.

&amp;#x200B;

And finally, the little brother that your mom made to take to the party and is now embarrassing you in front of the hot chicks, CLOV:

[No, CLOV, you were supposed to be the Chosen One. Not ruin my portfolio!](

Now, I know some of you are thinking: CLOV? What the fuck? CLOV doesn't belong on this list. It belongs on the list with WISH, WKHS and all that other garbage. And you'd be right to think that. But I still own CLOV, and it is ***technically*** not dead. It's just ***mostly dead***, and if you've seen the Princess Bride, you know that mostly dead has a cure.... unlike my stupidity. In addition, CLOV has been hovering near the top of the sentiment lists for some time, so there's that.

Like the others above, CLOV has broken out of a downtrend, or possibly two (I was generous with that second, orange line). However, unlike BB or GME, CLOV is nowhere near its prior breakout level. Indeed, the $9 mark is proving to be an impenetrable barrier. We might actually need a Zombie Dragon to take that fucker down. On the good side of the TA, the \~$8 line is proving to be the actual bottom.

On the DD side, CLOV had its earnings and they were wholly unimpressive. The clovtards dug deep to find the nuggets of good, but the overall market said, ""Yeah, nah bitch,"" and slapped it back down with an extra helping of pimp-hand.

**Cbass's Call for CLOV:** It exists to fuck up my yearly P/L, but if GME and AMC can take off, they'll carry CLOV and its whole clown army up with them. Problem is, there's no imminent breakout overhead. We've got to go up a ways before any true breakout can be attempted. Which means unless we get a truly epic launch of the whole Meme Space Force, CLOV has the potential to get shot down before ever getting back up to the high teens, let alone the twenties.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 2. The Voice of Alex Jones**

It's conspiracy theory time! Yayy!

So the voice of Alex Jones came to me in a dream the other night and it got me wondering: Is this whole endeavor an elaborate trap to ensnare idiot retail traders into terrible options that are certain to expire worthless? Let's look at the evidence.

First, we didn't get any breakouts until after the 8/20 expiry. Together with the 7/16 expiry, this represented (I believe) a ***massive*** chunk of options. I saw this regarding CLOV, and I suspect it is a similar story for GME, AMC and BB, and a whole host of other 'meme stocks.'

Second, I'm *quite sure* at this point that Big Money is behind the Jedi Options Wizardry that causes these massive spikes. Originally, I thought that this was just a Big Money vs. Big Money game and we were naught but pawns in their schemes.

Now... I'm beginning to think ~~aliens~~ ***the House*** is in on it. Basically, they are going to let/help the meme stock launches in order to rope a bunch of idiots into buying shitty options. Particularly, those who buy them on the downslope of the spikes, hoping for a quick rebound. Those options are going to be easy to kill and the House can clean up.

But they'll never get the chance if the whole meme stock ""movement"" dies a slow death. It is only by hanging a line out, enticing the morons with dreams of easy money and fast cars and loose women that they can get y'all to bite in large enough numbers. Basically, the sight of those big green dildos is impossible to resist and FOMO takes over and you dipshits buy options that are all but DoA.

**So, is this all just a trap?** Answer: **yes**, no matter which way you look at it.

Even disregarding my tinfoil hat ramblings, this past week's action has the smell of a classic bull-trap.

**But does it actually matter?** Answer: **no**. You can still make money, and a fuck load of it, even if my tinfoil hat theory is right. *Especially* if it's right, in fact.

[We're gonna last a lot longer against those hedge funds than we will against that Citadel!](

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 3. A New Hope**

I've been sensing a turning of opinion in the short time I've been here with you all. When I first came upon this wonderful community of simpletons, DD posts about new companies were most often met with ""You had me at retard"" and ""I'm all in.""

Now it seems people are too scared to post high quality DD's because the immediate response is ""Fuck your pump &amp; dump and your mom while we're at it!"" Were there pump and dumps? Too many to count. Did I fall for one? Probably.

While some OGs are breathing a sigh of relief at this relative return to ""normality,"" and I can't blame them, I still feel a certain something has been lost. That magic feeling, that tingling in the ballsack that whispered to you, ""*this is stupid, but it might actually work anyway*."" This week, for one glorious moment, I felt that again and damn did it feel good.

Sure we bagholders are a pitiable bunch. That cannot be denied, even if we keep it close to the chest, even, I think, for those most ardent cult members. Still, there is something to be said of keeping hope alive, of holding on to the belief that broken and battered simpletons left atop seemingly insurmountable peaks on charts awash in red ***can still be saved***.

So as another week comes upon us, I implore you to not lose hope, for it is *literally all we have left*. Hear that John Williams score rise in the ether about you, and know this: It's not over until we blow up ~~the Death Star~~ *our accounts*! (^(Or Disney buys us))

This means that passive funds that track the S&amp;P 500 and other diverse markets are now larger in market share than actively managed funds in domestic markets. This graph also shows the massive growth in fund market share by passive funds compared to active funds over the last 6 years.

This growth I think is being caused by widespread support for index investing. Nearly every news article, informational paper, and online forum are all repeating the same message of investing into passive growth funds/ETFs and just holding them no matter what happens, even during large downturns. Historical data supports this and many well known investing figures also share this message. Even most new investors it seems after small losses from active trading or trying to time the market are converted to this philosophy.

Which leads me to the question: how does it ever go down here? People are being indoctrinated to keep holding during every crash and even buy dips with excess money. Historically selling at the bottom is the worst possible situation and everyone seems to know this. The rise in 401k usage and passive tax advantaged funds with penalties for withdrawing from the market also supports this. So if retail investors make up [77% of the market]( who is left that actually sells their equities?

I guess market makers with HFT bots are the only answer. These bots will attempt to sell at the instant sign of bad news in order to try to shake out weak hands, start a crash, and buy at the bottom. The recent March 2020 crash is an example of how this sell then buy cycle is getting shorter and shorter as less retail gets shaken off. The more market confidence grows and the more people hold through the dips, the shorter and less severe these crashes get.

Korsuva is a drug group of CARA and refers to the reduction of itching. This offers two benefits. First, potential treatment modalities for symptom reduction are easier to create than a basic cause cure. Second, from a commercial perspective, recurring sales of such products are much more profitable. There are four disease types, of which 5 different versions of Korsuva are currently being tested in the pipeline. 


1)	
The treatment of pruritus in combination with chronic kidney disease (CKD-aP) in adults undergoing hemodialysis, or ""IV Korsuva,"" was approved this week. The results from the approved product in terms of safety and efficacy were impressive. It took over ten years of development. 


2)	
The main product in this pipeline ""Oral Korsuva: Atopic Dermatitis (AD)"" was responsible for the share price plunge in April 2021. However, the readouts were misinterpreted and may not be a complete write off. The study missed targets in moderate-to-severe pruritus, but met all targets in patients with mild-to-moderate AD (accounted for 64% of participants). Phase III will also be initiated for this group in Q3 2021. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic, pruritic, inflammatory dermatosis, affecting up to 12% of children and 5% to 7% of adults, and patients with mild to moderate AD also make up a significantly larger target group.  


3)	
There are no adverse events in any of the other studies in the pipeline. The approval this week is also a positive sign for all other pipeline studies, as the products do not differ in their basic structure, except that the others are oral treatments. Importantly, all of the rest of the pipeline is in Phase II. These are not high-risk, low-probability trials, but have been well proven. 


 
*FDA approval for intervenous injection of ""IV Korsuva"" is not a niche product*



Worldwide, 3.7 million patients regularly undergo dialysis treatments. These treatments are vital. Kidney disease is one of the top 10 causes of death in the United States. Nearly 40 million people in the U.S. are affected by chronic kidney disease. Of these, 500,000 patients require dialysis. 40% percent of dialysis patients are affected by symptoms, which ""IV Korsuva"" treats. In the USA alone, 200 000 people are potential customers immediately. It is precisely for this potential market that ""IV Korsuva"" has just been approved as the first (!)  treatment method. According to the National Kidney Foundation, more than 30 million patients live with chronic kidney disease. It is estimated that almost 50% of patients suffer from some form of itch Even if the oral version of Korsuva has not yet been approved, the market is already huge in USA only.  


 
*Production &amp; sales with Q1 2022 launch is a no-brainer*



""IV Korsuva"" is the first approved treatment in this field. One has the advantage of first mover and will dominate the market. First of all, manufacturing is a fast process because the chemical structure is very simple. By partnering with Vifor, one has a gigantic advantage. Vifor has a joint venture with Fresenius Medical Care (FMC). FMC specializes in kidney disease. 345,646 patients in a worldwide network of 4,000 dialysis clinics receive treatment at FMC. 1/3 of the dialysis centers in the U.S. are attributable to FMC. Here, profits are shared 50/50. In non-FMC dialysis centers, which account for two-thirds, Vifor also handles distribution and profits are split 60/40. Whether dialysis will increasingly be performed at home in the future is not relevant, as these are also managed by FMC. 


 
*Shareholder structure - ""Smart Money*



75% of the market capitalization is held by insiders or institutions. Partner Vifor holds almost 15% of the shares. Part is known to have been acquired in 2018 for $17/share. According to the terms of the agreement, Vifor is entitled to common shares in the amount of $50 million at a 20% premium to the 30day price after approval of ""IV Korsuva"". 


 
*Profits only (!) with ""IV Korsuva""*



There are two types of agreements. 

1)
2018: Vifor is allowed to distribute ""IV Korsuva"" worldwide except USA, Japan and South Korea. For this, CARA has received $50 million in cash and the as before mentioned $20 million acquisition for $17/share. In addition, CARA is entitled to payments of $470 million, of which $440 million is revenue-based. CARA is also entitled to tiered royalties based on net sales of KORSUVA injections in the licensed territories.  

2)
2020 Update-U.S.: CARA will receive up to USD 240 million upon achievement of certain salesbased milestones. In addition, Vifor has paid USD 100 million upfront. If Vifor wants to pay USD 240m in the coming years for about 43% (1/3 * 50% FMC + 2/3 * 40% non-FMC) of profits and has already paid USD 100m upfront, then Vifor/FMC must be sure that more than this bonus plus upfront payment can be generated in profits, otherwise the deal would be meaningless. 57% of the profits remain with CARA. It may be assumed that Vifor has done its homework and a conservative calculation, in which Vifor breakeven exits, results in the following profits for CARA. If 340 million payments from Vifor is to be worth at least 43% of profits, then CARA's 57% profit share must be worth approximately $450 million. Thus, one can consistently assume sales in the billions in the coming years, of which at least USD 790 million (340 + 450) will be retained by CARA. Vifor/FMC knows its patients in the clinics and knows exactly what potential lies dormant here. Vifor will not enter into a breakeven deal but expect much higher profits. These are just conservative estimates. Again, I would like to explicitly point out that the use of ""Korsuva IV"" does not reduce the number of patients, but only alleviates their symptoms. This is an essential difference to a cure.  


 
 
*Future price drivers* 



1)	
Medicare and Medicaid approvals will come in the next few weeks. 

2)	
In Q3 2021, Phase III will be initiated for the successful ""Oral Korsuva: Atopic Dermatitis (AD)"" portion. FDA will not raise any issues here as it is only Phase III and not a commitment. Thus, the April 2021 price slide is partially moot. 

3)	
EMA approval for ""IV Korsuva"" is expected in the first/second quarter of 2022. 

4)	
One may wait for an extension of the partnership with Vifor/FMC for Europe or updates which have not been communicated yet. The difference of announced payments from 2018 and 2020 show that CARA will get even more money from Vifor/FMC in the future. 

5)	
The launch of the distribution and regular quarterly results with continuously growing sales are unusual and very rare for biotechs. This news will fuel the share price. 

6)	
Future readouts of oral versions of Korsuva offer far more opportunities than risks. CARA was sold off after the last readout in April 2021. The negative results are priced into the share price. Any potential positive readout of one of the 4 oral versions of Korsuva would cause the share price to explode. 

7)
	Vifor will acquire the agreed block of shares (due to the successful FDA approval) in the amount of USD 50 million. Given the immense total investment, a buy-out is very likely. 

8)
	7.5 percent of the shares are sold short. Hedge funds have speculated on a rejection by the FDA and will liquidate their positions in the coming days or weeks. A small short-squeeze is also possible. 

9)	
CARA has now announced that the approval will fund the entire pipeline through 2023. 
 
 
*Conclusion*

CARA is now no longer a speculative stock, but with the approval of ""IV Korsuva"" a value company with the prospect that the pipeline can explode the value. You get CARA at the price before the important FDA decision with the value of the FDA approval. Only with approval of ""IV Korsuva"" in the US is CARA worth at least $30-45/share. Oral approval would give final access to the mass market. Here we are not talking about 100 or 200 percent upside potential, but a tenbagger.

For anyone saying the date in the article is wrong here, on Twitter Oracle stated ""Google struck secret deals worth ""hundreds of millions"" of dollars with developers like Activision"" at 1:05 PM EST. By doing a simple Google search of the Google and Activision deal, you will notice Business Insider changed the date to make it look hidden, but the original article below has the time stamp on Friday.

Morgan Stanley came out with an article recently seeing a $120 price target.

The legal stuff is priced in. The stock has consolidated and started an upward trend. In the World of Warcraft Shadowlands 9.1.5 update, the company addressed the issue the lawsuit was covering and suggests they are going in the correct direction. The update comes out the same week of 9/3.

If we open $85 Monday, I can easily see this stock hitting $87-$90 easily. The main catalyst here is the Google deal which the media hasn't publicized enough. The fact that someone bought 10K calls on 8/23 and hasn't sold them is the biggest indicator here for me along with the Google deal. The IV on calls Friday jumped and $ATVI held its gains.

According to their website “Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. (NYSE: MMP) is a publicly traded partnership that primarily transports, stores and distributes petroleum products.”

What peaked my interest in them is one of our representatives, Trey Hollingsworth, has been buying into them heavily for the past year. What’s also interesting is he happens to be on the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee and the Vice Ranking Member of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship and Capital Markets.



His net worth is about 50 million and it looks like he has bought at least a million in shares, so a decent portion of his NT - possibly 2-4%. 
Due to his political position and his own wealth, you could make the assumption that he’s a fairly savvy investor. 

What’s also interesting is it seems he has submitted all his financial disclosures by hand. It’s recommended that all members report digitally if they can. He’s a young guy, 37, so I’m sure he’s not technologically disinclined. Submitting handwritten documents makes it harder for computers to parse and interpret these trades too. 

Is it possible he’s been trying to obfuscate his trades as he accumulated this year? Or does he just not have enough time to enter these in himself so he has them faxed over? Regardless, this is interesting. 

Even if there’s nothing going on here, his position in this company gives it a certain kind of weight. Why might someone in his position be buying into petroleum right now? 

It’s possible that this is his inflation hedge/bet. According to this earnings transcript the company’s assets have a natural exposure to inflation. 

“So we would expect that our index rates are going to be — have a significant increase next year driven by the index and PPI”



—-

Another interesting find. MMP is selling off some of their assets. They just sold some of their independent terminals. 

They already have a pretty pristine balance sheet. I wonder why they are doing this. Will this finance some future growth investments? They have heavily cut down investments recently however and even kept the distribution level for the first time in 20 years so I’m not so sure. 

Could it be possible that they are cleaning up the balance sheet even more in an attempt to make themselves more attractive for acquisition? 

This wouldn’t be the first time a member invested in a company that was bought out. Just recently Landmark Infrastructure Partners was bought out. A member bought into this a few months before. 

—-

Regardless of these speculations, MMP is one of the most attractive dividend stocks that I’ve seen lately paying out about an 8% divvy. They have strong financials and the petroleum space still has some good years in it. We’re mostly still using gasoline and diesel.

Afghanistan has been one of the hot topics in the news lately, and if what happened there is good or bad is not for me to decide. Let's look at how Palantir and us can benefit from the situation there.

Even with the withdrawal of the army the US interest in the region won't diminish. It is quite obvious that, now, the Afghanistan territory will be mostly monitored using geospacial and drone imaging. That's the crap that Gotham was made from, and they probably have been using it in Afghanistan for a while now. While that is interesting, I would like to focus a bit more on the immigration side of the problem.

The deadline for the evacuation given by the Taliban is 31st of August. I expect that starting September/October, a new immigration wave towards EU will start, just like in 2015 following the events in Syria. Since then, and in light of the Covid pandemic, Europe's desire for immigrants cooled off.

The EU border countries like Greece, Italy and Poland are most affected by illegal immigration from the middle east.

[Immigration routes to EU 2015](

Greek government signed a contract with Palantir back in December 2020, the contract details were not disclosed. [

Greece has recently finished building it's wall \*orange man flashbacks\* on the border with Turkey to control and prevent illegal immigration. In a BBC news interview with a greek freelance journalist, they mentioned that beside the border force, AI tech and digital surveillance is to be employed (4:06), that sounds familiar. [

The old potato dictator of Europe in the light of the recent EU sanctions announced that he will let middle eastern illegal immigrant pass through his country to freely stream into EU. [



Palantir has done amazing work in the past for ICE and border force in US. 

They are in a great position to offer similar services to EU border forces.

* No tapering or rate hikes until 2022, at the earliest. So 6 more months of bull market. Buy calls.
* JPow is buying so many bonds, that the bond market is no longer a reliable indicator of inflation.

I had been eagerly awaiting Jerry Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole, and honestly thought he would have actually said something. Instead, it was mostly a nothing-burger. So brrrrrrrrr it keeps going; at least for six more months.

**Summary of Speech:**

He talked for a while and basically rehashed the same stuff he’s been saying. Let me save you your time:

* Inflation is transitory. Nothing to see here.
* Inflation should get back to 2%
* Covid could still pose a problem, even though the recovery is moving right along.

JPow said nothing about when QE might slow down; only that he ***might do it if*** the economy gets stronger. Which is what’s he’s said for a year? This is a very weaksauce indicator.

**Economic Metrics:**

Stocks? All time highs.

Housing prices? All time highs.

Unemployment? 5%? Companies are begging for workers and $15/hr is the defacto minimum wage.

Inflation? It is also roaring.

There is no economic case to keep QE running at $120 billion per year.  The market can stay irrational longer than bears can stay solvent, especially when the market is pumped up by brrrrrrrr.

So what happened and how can we make money?

The $USD nose-dived on Powell’s speech. Various US dollar ETFs (DXY, UUP, USDU, UDN) are now hitting their 50 day moving averages or moving in that direction.  Just pick one of those ETFs and look at their chart.

&amp;#x200B;



Here is another example from another US Dollar ETF. Both show their 200 day and 50 day moving averages coming together, and now they are hitting or crashing through their 50 day.

&amp;#x200B;



GLD and other gold etfs also broke above their long term moving averages after JPow’s speech. Here is GLD.

&amp;#x200B;



The fall in the Dollar and sharp rise in gold are both an important signal. If the US Dollar holds here, its strengthening is over and it is time to go (stay?) whole hog into inflationary stocks, precious metals, etc.   And that’s what most of us are holding, so that’s good news.

One final note: When you see tables like this on CNBC, ignore them (more than you already do)

&amp;#x200B;



In every textbook or old investing book, for like 100 years, bonds were a good indicator of inflation and deflation. Bond traders were very savvy, the markets were deep and liquid, etc. But with years of QE, the Fed now owns trillions of dollars of bonds, and is still spending nearly $1 trillion per year buying more Treasury bonds. For certain US treasury bonds, the Fed owns more than 50% of the outstanding bonds. So, the bond market is not going to react as accurately as in the past, when the biggest whale in the pond only buys bonds, and never sells them, and buys \~$80 billion of Treasury bonds per month.  And JPow has committed to keep buying them for at least 6 months.

Bull market continues, inflation will rip.

Buy 3 and 6 month out SPY calls. Other inflationary plays are stuff like GLD, Rio Tinto (RTNTF), Freeport McMoRan (FCX), and individual gold and silver mining companies and ETFs, but each of these asset types can have individual risks and are not purely driven by inflation.

**EDIT:** SPY 475 by end of year is my conservative guess.  ","At least 6 more bull months, based on JPow's speech",1225,7

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 30th, 2021.

# **A key jobs report in the week ahead could drive the next big market move - [(Source)](
*****
&gt; With Jackson Hole in the rear-view mirror, August’s employment report could be the next driver for markets.
*****
&gt; Stocks gained in the past week, surging again to new highs Friday after a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The chairman acknowledged that Fed officials expect to taper back their $120 billion a month bond-buying program this year, a first step toward reversing easy policy.
*****
&gt; Powell was speaking at the Kansas City Fed’s annual Jackson Hole, Wyo. symposium, held virtually this year. He said the Fed has seen sufficient progress on inflation, but the labor market has not yet improved enough to start the taper. Importantly, he also emphasized that the wind down of the bond program does not mean the Fed will automatically move on to raise interest rate hikes.
*****
&gt; “Powell has made it clear the Fed is not prepared to raise interest rates anytime soon. The market seems relieved by that. … With some of the economic data already slowing, I think interest rate hikes are far, far away, and investors are happy about that,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for the US SPDR business at State Street Global Advisors.
*****
&gt; Arone said the Fed has so far avoided a “taper tantrum,” similar to the 2013 market sell-off when the Fed announced it was rolling back quantitative easing. Powell’s speech was widely anticipated to clarify the Fed’s position on its $120 billion monthly bond purchases, after a number of Fed officials called for the start of a wind down.
*****
&gt; # Jobs are the focal point
*****
&gt; Now, market focus shifts even more fiercely to jobs data, with the release Friday of the August employment report.
*****
&gt; “For sure, the market is going to react,” said Jim Caron, head of macro strategies for global fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “I think it’s important. I think the issue that they’re going to have is unemployment benefits don’t really run out until the beginning of September. It’s really not until you get the October jobs number that you get a more free look at September.”
*****
&gt; The dollar index sank after Powell’s Friday morning speech, as stocks rallied to new highs and Treasury yields fell. Other data in the coming week includes consumer confidence Tuesday and Wednesday’s release of Institute for Supply Management manufacturing data and ADP’s private sector payroll data, a kind of preview for Friday’s government jobs report.
*****
&gt; “I wouldn’t be surprised to see follow-through Monday and Tuesday, but ahead of ADP on Wednesday, I’d look for position adjusting which means weaker stocks and weaker bonds and stronger dollar ahead of the jobs data,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex.
*****
&gt; He said Powell was dovish, as expected, while still emphasizing that tapering was coming. But the key for markets was that he stressed the end of the program does not mean “tightening” or rate hikes. The 10-year Treasury yield had risen above 1.35% this week, but fell to 1.3% after Powell spoke Friday.
*****
&gt; # U.S. 10-year Treasury yield
*****
&gt; “The market will get cautious again ahead of the jobs data. Then it’s a new world into September. You have to wait until after the jobs data to see if these moves have sustaining power. This is ‘a buy the rumor, sell the fact’ move,” Chandler said.
*****
&gt; Some market pros had expected an announcement on tapering from the Fed at its September meeting, but that view has now mostly changed to a November or December announcement. “Because of the uncertainty of delta, I think it will take more than the next jobs report,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “The disruption to jobs in particular is if schools have to close again.”
*****
&gt; Economists polled by Dow Jones expect 750,000 jobs were created in August and the unemployment rate fell to 5.2%. In July, the economy created 943,000 jobs and unemployment slid to 5.4%. Education was a big contributor in July, with 261,000 jobs added in public schools and private education.
*****
&gt; “It doesn’t have to be a spectacular number to satisfy their needs,” said Swonk of the August report. “You need a solid jobs number, something north of a half million... I think we’re going to be close to that. They’re going to want to see September employment as well.”
*****
&gt; # Market risks
*****
&gt; State Street’s Arone said the Fed’s discussion of the tapering will be top of mind in the markets, just as the next earnings season rolls around.
*****
&gt; “It will be interesting at a time when the Fed starts taking its foot off the pedal,” he said. “Right now, the bull case continues to be reasonably strong, but markets don’t go straight up. If I was going to key on a specific risk, I’d keep an eye on third quarter earnings reports, and more importantly what corporate executives are saying about next year.”
*****
&gt; Arone said strong earnings has been the biggest driver of market gains, helping investors ignore worries about the spread of the Covid delta variant, the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, and dysfunction in Washington.
*****
&gt; The market’s summer rally continued in the past week, with the Dow ending at 35,455, up just about 1% for the week. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both ended the week at record highs.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 1.5% at 4,509, and the Nasdaq rose 2.8% to 15,129.
*****
&gt; “The market has been able to ignore all this noise and rally,” he said, adding it would be ironic if it were earnings that caused a sell-off and not a Fed policy change or something else.
*****
&gt; He said the market could get choppy in September and into October, a seasonally weak time of year for stocks.
*****
&gt; “We caught a glimpse of this this quarter, with big tech — where the numbers were beating, but they suggested that future quarters would see slower growth,” Arone said. “Investors didn’t like that, and I think it gave us a glimpse of what happens if it spreads beyond the technology sector to other sectors.”
*****
&gt; There are a few earnings in the coming week, including Zoom Video Monday, Campbell Soup Wednesday, and Hewlett Packard and Broadcom Thursday.
*****
&gt; # Watching Ida
*****
&gt; The oil and gas industry is closely watching Hurricane Ida, which was heading straight for Louisiana. Oil, gasoline and natural gas all rallied Friday, as energy companies shut down Gulf of Mexico production ahead of the storm. Louisiana is also home to a number of refineries.
*****
&gt; West Texas Intermediate futures settled up nearly 2% Friday, at $68.74 per barrel. The benchmark U.S. crude was up more than 10% for the week, its best weekly gain since June 5, 2020.

&gt; # Small Cap Labor Day Rally Getting Underway

&gt; In the below chart, daily data since July 1, 1979 through August 20, 2021 for the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies are divided by the Russell 1000 index of largest companies, and then compressed into a single year to show an idealized yearly pattern. When the graph is descending, large-cap companies are outperforming small-cap companies; when the graph is rising, smaller companies are moving up faster than their larger brethren. The most prominent period of outperformance generally begins in mid-December and lasts until late-February or early March with a surge in January. This period of outperformance by small-caps is known as the “January Effect” in the annual Stock Trader’s Almanac.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](

&gt; In recent years, another sizable move is quite evident just before Labor Day. One possible explanation for this move is individual investors begin to return to work after summertime vacations and are searching for “bargain” stocks. In a typical year, small-caps would have been lagging and could represent an opportunity relative to other large-cap possibilities. As of today’s close, Russell 2000 is up 13.4% compared to the Russell 1000 being up 19.0% year-to-date. Lagging small-caps and resilient U.S. consumers could be the ideal setup for a repeat of this pattern this year. However, the small-cap advantage does historically wane around mid-September.

*****

&gt; # Small-Caps Bounce

&gt; ln today's Morning Lineup, we noted the inverse correlation between performance this week and market caps. As shown in the major US Indices screen of our Trend Analyzer tool, the two best performers over the past five days have been Micro-Caps (IWC) followed by small caps like the Russell 2000 (IWM) and the Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF (IJR). Mid-cap ETFs are the next best performers with high 2% gains then most large cap indices have only risen around 1.5% this week with the exception of the Dow (DIA) which has not even gained 1%. As for where these indices are trading relative to each one's trading range, it is partially a mean reversion story. Small caps were deeply oversold one week ago and are now sitting just below their 50-DMAs. While not to as extreme of a degree, mid-caps were similarly trading a full standard deviation below their 50-DMAs last week. Today, they are on the opposite side of their 50-DMAs and on the verge of overbought readings.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](

&gt; As previously mentioned, small caps like the Micro-Cap ETF (IWC) and Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) were oversold last week. From a charting perspective, each of these indices' rallies this week are not only bounces from extreme oversold levels, but they also follow brief dips below their 200-DMAs. But whereas the past five days have seen solid gains, yesterday saw IWC and IWM reject their 50-DMAs and the high end of their ranges that have been in place since late July. In other words, even though small caps have led the market this week, they are not out of the woods yet.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](

&gt; Looking at the relative strength lines of small caps like IWC and IWM versus the large cap S&amp;P 500 (SPY) over the past year, the past week's outperformance again is a blip on the radar and has only put a small dent in the longer term trend of underperformance.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](

&gt; Where that is not necessarily the case is small market caps versus the smallest market caps. As shown below, the relative strength line of the Micro-Cap ETF (IWC) versus the Russell 2000 (IWM) broke out of the past few months' downtrend over the past few days.

&gt; As impressive as 50 new highs is, investors need to remember that new highs happen in clusters that can last decades. We’ve been sharing this chart for years, saying exactly that: previous periods of new highs lasted much longer than most expected. Mark Twain said history doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes. If history rhymes once again, we could still have several more years of new highs.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](

&gt; Another interesting stat about S&amp;P 500 all-time highs is every month so far in 2021 has seen a new high, 8 for 8. Only once have all 12 months made a new all-time high and that was in 2014. This is somewhat surprising, given the S&amp;P 500 gained only 11.4% in 2014, but it was a very slow and persistent move. Most investors (including this author) would guess it was 1995, but that spectacular year saw new highs in ‘only’ 10 months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](

&gt; Although August tends to be historically weak for stocks, that hasn’t been the case this year. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has made an incredible 9 new highs already this month, the most since 1929. No, we don’t think this is another 1929, but this is just another way to show how astounding this bull run has been.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 50 new S&amp;P 500 all-time highs before the end of August is quite a feat. In fact, only twice has the 50 level been cracked through the end of August, in 1964 and 1995.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](

&gt; So what happens next? The rest of the year in 1964 the S&amp;P 500 added 3.6%, while it added 9.6% in 1995. Below we looked at all the years with at least 30 new all-time highs through August and sure enough, better than average returns the rest of the year are common. The final 4 months gained 4.7%, versus the average final 4 months gain for all years of 3.6%. Now this is skewed due to 1987s crash, as that was the only time stocks were lower the final 4 months after more than 30 new highs by the end of August. Smoothing things out, the median return jumps up to a very impressive 5.4%, versus a median return of 3.6% for all years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](

&gt; 2021 is off to a roaring start and we continue to expect higher prices before all is said and done. The studies we did today do little to change our view. We’d use any potential weakness as an opportunity to add before potential higher prices.

&gt; # Nasdaq Crosses Another 1,000 Point Threshold

&gt; It won't be official until the close, but with the Nasdaq crossing 15,000 for the first time today, it's on pace to cross its third 1,000 point threshold this year and the sixth since the pandemic began in early 2020. The table below lists each 1,000 point threshold that the Nasdaq has crossed over time along with the first day that it crossed that threshold, the number of days since the prior cross, what percentage that 1,000 point consists of relative to the prior threshold, and then how many upside and downside crosses the Nasdaq has had around that level on a closing basis.

&gt; Of all the 1,000 point thresholds the Nasdaq has crossed over time, the only one that it never traded back below after crossing it was 6,000 back in April 2017. Besides 1,000, that was also the 1,000 point threshold that took the longest to cross above. After first crossing 5,000 back in March 2000, it took 6,256 days for the Nasdaq to top 6,000. Since then, though, the Nasdaq has been making quick work of 1,000 point thresholds. With the exception of the 486-day gap between 8K and 9K, every other 1,000-point threshold since 6,000 has taken less than a year to cross. Even in the midst of a global pandemic, it took the Nasdaq less than six months to get from 9,000 to 10,000.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](

&gt; The long-term chart of the Nasdaq below includes red dots to show each time the Nasdaq first crossed a 1,000 point threshold along with the number of days for each one.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](

&gt; Looking at the chart above may give you a feeling of lightheadedness given the seemingly parabolic nature of the last few years. An important thing to keep in mind, though, is that as a percentage of the index's price level, every 1,000 point threshold represents a smaller move in percentage terms. While the move from 9K to 10K represented a move of over 11%, the move from 14K to 15K represents only a little more than 7%. Looking at this chart on a log scale where each label on the y-axis represents a doubling of the index shows how modest the recent 1,000 point thresholds have been relative to earlier ones. Think about it this way, in the less than two years between when the Nasdaq first crossed 2K to when it crossed 5K for the first time (four different 1,000 point thresholds), it rallied 150%. Over the last four years, though, the Nasdaq has crossed 10 different 1,000-point thresholds, but the gain has also only been 150%.

&gt; # Bulls Head In Separate Directions

&gt;As the major indices have set more record highs in the past week, bullish sentiment has rebounded. The American Association of Individual Investors' (AAII) weekly reading on bullish sentiment rose 6.4 percentage points to 39.4% this week. That is the highest reading of optimism since the week of July 8th when bullish sentiment was a hair above 40%. While recovered, that reading is still muted versus the past year's range and is only 1.5 percentage points above their historical average. In other words, bullish sentiment has rebounded but is far from elevated.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](

&gt; While the AAII survey showed an increase in bullish sentiment, another survey of newsletter writers from Investors Intelligence saw the opposite result. This survey's reading on bullish sentiment dropped to just 50% this week which is the lowest level since May of last year. Although this reading has now fallen out of the past year's range, it is still slightly elevated versus the historical average of 45%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](

&gt; Given the uptick in bullish sentiment, the AAII survey saw only a third of respondents report as bearish versus 35.1% last week. Like bullish sentiment, this reading remains outside of the range it has occupied for most of the past year although that current reading is also not far away from the historical average of 30.5%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](

&gt; As we noted in last Thursday's Chart of the Day, the bull-bear spread dipped into negative territory last week for the first time since late January and it was at the lowest level since October 2020. With the inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment this week, the spread has moved back into positive territory to its highest level since the last week of July.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](

&gt; Not all of the gains to bullish sentiment came from the bearish camp. Neutral sentiment saw an even larger decline of 4.2 percentage points. That brings the reading down to 27.5% which is the lowest reading since April 15th when it stood at just 21.6%.

76,post,pd45fl,2th52,wallstreetbets,False,2021-08-27 22:41:01,https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pd45fl/mvis_bet/,self.wallstreetbets,,"I'm going to keep this short, most here probably have already heard of $MVIS (microvision), their IP is around laser beam scanning technology, used in near eye displays (NED) such as Microsoft Hololens 2, and now their primary focus is automotive lidar.

The bad, company has been around for 20 some years and poor revenue each year making most call it an overvalued shit stock, but I figure if the DOD is paying Microsoft $20bn for a military version of the Hololens (IVAS) then their tech must be good, which should translate over to their automotive lidar. If you then compare their market cap vs other speculative lidar companies market caps then they start to seem undervalued, having the NED technology is just an added bonus.

Anyhow this post was less of a DD as others have gone to much greater extents explaining the value of this company and their tech, my main reason posting is to share my bet in the open then come mid Sept we can all see it play out for better or for worse.

Oh almost forgot, MVIS will be at a mobility conference in Germany Sept 7-12 where they'll publicly demo their lidar units for the first time, claiming best in class, addressing SWAP-C and OEM / Tier 1 needs.

Oh one more, MVIS couldn't acknowledge MSFT as being their customer until the last EC when it was announced due to NDA. Why the sudden change? Well if the NED vertical was in the process of being sold off to MSFT then trying to hide it doesn't really matter anymore. Drew Markham joined MVIS 3 months ago as general counsel with decades of M&amp;A experience. I expect the vertical sold and nice one time dividend coming within the next 3-6 months.


Positions: 6000+ shares @ 14.5, ~160 calls strike $14.50, $1.78 premium expiry Sept 17th!

78,post,pd1usc,2th52,wallstreetbets,False,2021-08-27 19:52:42,https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pd1usc/pins_mommy_makeout_play/,self.wallstreetbets,,"Pinterest is the 14th LARGEST social network in the world ! Dominated by mommies! Over 71% of their user base is Female and maintains a competitive edge among its competitors with 454 MILLION monthly active users. This might be the only chance you get to be THIS close to hot single moms in your AREA!! So sit down, pop a breath mint because your breath stinks, and enjoy the DD. 

Is Pinterest even popular? Why don’t you start asking MOMS! Pinterest is where all Mommies gather! They can spend all their time visually searching countless ideas related to fashion, cooking, decor, art, dream cars / houses, even new wedding ideas for her 3rd try at marriage. One concept that has worked for Pinterest is bringing a positive mindset to social media. In other words, it’s a safe place from those drunk 1 AM snaps or those 3 AM lonely DM attempts. Besides PINS being an online oasis from negativity on social networks, it also allows users to shop, pretend they’re creative, and feel inspired daily.

Why PINS ad revenue is superb. Pinterest’s primary source of revenue is from promotional ad pins that hide in plain sight. These ads are blended in when users search the site for ideas. These promotional ads are tailored specifically to the things you search for. The ads look the same as the pins / images you browse so it is very easy to click on the ads without thinking (mommy brain) and even purchase the product (with your husbands credit card) All this helped PINS generate that whooping $1.6 billion revenue they made for 2020. Women be shopping so it’s not surprising Pinterest has become the go to social media site for impulse shopping and mindless ad viewing.

Now, can Pinterest bounce? boobs. Currently at a share price of $56 ish and peaking in the $90 range, slow American user growth has caused the price to tumble recently. Yet, their financials and international user growth continues to grow and is quite impressive! The positives for PINS are the main reasons why Microsoft thought they were worth it and wanted to acquire them for $51 billion, Cathie Wood (the stock market’s #1 mommy) holds a $9M position in her fund, and the collaboration with Shopify. Pinterest has built a strong platform that can continue to win in the social media category.

Pinterest is used when moms want to spend their money; planning a wedding, trip, party, or other stay at home mom interests. This makes the app a prime place for advertisers to market. Advertisers get an excellent ROI when they convert users to customers which keeps them coming back to advertise on the platform. 

In conclusion, I think the recent pullback in price makes PINS a Mommy Makeout Play! I believe in the power of all moms to keep the growth of Pinterest very strong LONG TERM! Including but not limited to, stay at home moms, single moms, hot moms, soccer moms, and even your mom.",$PINS = MOMMY MAKEOUT PLAY?!,44,7

Somehow I always manage to lose money on AMD ever since I found WSB a couple of years ago. Poor timing because AMD keeps going up after my options expire.  
I am learning to buy a little longer than just a weekly and it's working out a little better.

Just another thing I suck at in life I suppose. Figured I might as well get fake internet points out of it. 

I started off hot in March 2020 with some PENN puts and some FB calls during the summer, all downhill from there.

[I started with blowing up my Robinhood account during the huge recovery which was seemingly impossible, the mark of a true a-word.](

The biggest loss was about 11k on PENN puts. As you'll note, I sold on 9/23 for $0.41. These opened the next day at a high around $4 upon news of a public offering. Would have been about 58k profit instead of 11k loss if I held like a man.

[Should have held but I have pussy hands.](

I then tricked myself into believing that Robinhood was a shit broker and that was my problem, when indeed I am just a shit trader. So I decided to wander over to TDAmeritrade.

I started off and made decent gains off of PLTR on the November run-up and withdrew my gains like a good boy. Decided to redeposit those gains in 2021 along with some fresh powder and proceeded to blow it up quickly.

[RIP TDA](

Because TDA has some of the worst UI in existence, please see my biggest losers via Excel magic below. I decided to buy into LVS while China was still getting railed by COVID, bought into AMZN after a massive move up, and bought some 0dte on TSLA 

&amp;#x200B;

[I thought calls only made money?](

So here I am about 38k in the hole (roughly) after 1.5 years. I've somehow tricked my brain into not being in a total state of depression, so that's a win. I'm on the sidelines for now just buying shares. But I'm sure I'll be back, I'm a true r-word at heart after all. I've managed to pay off my car over this time and refinance my mortgage, so I guess it's not all bad. See you soon. Shooters shoot!",Been a tough first year.....RIP to 2 accounts,187,3

In a time where retards like you and I are searching for the next play like it’s some delicious glue, I present to you GoodRx. Looking for a braindead play to take advantage of short volume getting caught out undervaluing a company? Look no further.

GoodRx provides a platform to search for prescriptions, enabling users to track drug prices to compare options. It also provides free drug coupons for discounts on medications, runs a subscription service for further discounts and free deliveries, among other services.

On 8/12, they released 2Q earnings, notably reporting 43% y/y growth and 6mil monthly active users (up 36%). After beating revenue and earnings, GoodRx jumped 18.6% and has been trading at around the $35-37 range. With a 52-wk high over $64 and low of $26, the upside suggests there’s plenty of room to run. Since earnings, the short volume ratio has not dipped below .40, averaging closer to .55 over that time.



You’ll see that short volume has not changed much since a solid earnings report, including news about a partnership with Surescripts, who manage a platform that allows prescribing physicians to see the drug’s cost for their patients. This is just one of a few strategic partnerships GoodRx made over the past year to contribute to the massive revenue gain.

Highshortinterest,com lists the short interest as of 8/13 over 28%. The set-up is among the best for short interest and has the potential to run on low volume.

Future growth opportunities are strong for GoodRx, who reports that its prices beat insurer prices by 50%, while out-of-pocket prescription costs in the US reach all-time highs. More consumers will be looking for prescription discounts, and GoodRx leads the way.

**Bear case:**

In the short run, independent pharmacies have hit back over the Superscripts partnership. They claim that the deal will hurt independent pharmacies and further obscure drug costs, as GoodRx discount information will only pricing data for pharmacy partners of GoodRx, leaving out independent pharmacies. Further, they say negotiated discounts would only appear for the uninsured or patients whose price information isn’t already available from their insurer or benefit manager. In the short run this may have implications, but that depends on the likelihood of Superscripts to back out on the deal.

In the long term, Amazon Pharmacy may present headwinds to GoodRx and any other player in this space. Though mail-order prescriptions only make up \~5% of fill count in the U.S., Amazon’s entry into the pharmacy space is probably more concerning than CEO Trevor Bezdek lets on. He claims for the current period that they’ve seen “zero impact from Amazon Pharmacy or any other companies in that space”.

**Current situation:**

Despite solid earnings and future growth potential, short volume on the stock has been mounting. Sitting near the top of high short interest stocks, GoodRx is being treated as the only way from here is down. The macro situation for GoodRx is rather positive in both the near term and over the long haul as us pill-popping degenerates look for cheaper options for our Adderall prescriptions.

Do you sniff paint? Do you like trend analysis? Ok fine, here’s some bullshit I drew on a chart



Not enough bullshit for you? Analysts' price target is $41.71, with highs of $56. It sits today up 5% on the day on rather low volume, so these shorts may already be feeling some pressure.

He has also hinted that tapering *may* begin as soon as the end of the year. So based on these breadcrumbs and looking deep into my crystal ball, I've come up with a basic timeline of what to expect regarding tapering and interest rates.

&amp;#x200B;

First: there are ***three*** things the Fed can do in terms of restricting actions:

1. **Tapering** \- this is a reduction in quantitative easing, i.e., purchases of various bonds to increase the Feds balance sheet
2. **Raising Rates** \- self-explanatory, I hope
3. **Tightening** \- this is quantitative tightening (QT), i.e., sales of various bonds to reduce the Feds balance sheet

The order I've listed these things ***is the order they will be done in.*** You can mark me on that and shit on me all you want if I'm wrong, but I won't be wrong. There ***may*** be some overlap at the end of Tapering and the start of Rate Raising, but more likely than not it will be completely sequential, i.e., rates will only be raised ***after*** the full tapering of QE.

Furthermore, there will ***never*** be more than ***one of the three*** happening at the same time \[edit - in any significant way; slight overlapping aside\]. JPow tried two-at-once in 2018 when he was doing QT and raising rates simultaneously and the result was Bloody Christmas Eve. He'll not repeat that mistake again, for it resulted in a massive shitstorm befalling him. And neither will any other Fed Chair for the foreseeable future. Nobody wants to be ""that guy that ruined the party"" (or girl, as it may be).

Theoretically, you could do QT ***before*** raising rates, but I'm leaning toward QT ***never happening***. By never, I mean that the actual universe will end before we do it again.

An Alex Jones interlude: So, it's looking to me like governments around the world have discovered a magic new place to park their debt that is technically 'off the books' but not actually off the books: their **central bank**. Having discovered this ***one simple trick*** for avoiding default, I expect them to abuse it to the maximum. Thus, QT is never going to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cbass's Timeline:**

December 2021: Tapering is announced, and will begin **very small**. The Taper Tantrum dip begins in truth.

July 2022: Tapering is kept at a slower than expected rate owing to ***reasons***, and will not be finished until 2023 - this is confirmed in the December 2022 meeting

Spring 2023: Tapering is finally finished, and rate hikes are announced; ***slow*** rate hikes with lots and *lots* and ***lots*** of caveats about the Fed being ready to '*change course at a moment notice*' if things look like they're going south

2024 and beyond: Expect the rates hikes to be ***extremely slow***, with frequent, long pauses. I'm predicting a minimum of 3-4 years to complete the hiking cycle to a maximum of 3-4% - and this is the 'fast' scenario

I don't expect anything other than good dip buying opportunities over the next 18 months, with particular emphasis on early next year. That being said, it is likely that even next year's Taper Tantrum dip is going to settle at a price ***higher than today's close***. Still, I'll DCA this time period just in case.

Are we supposed to just ignore how much value Apple is returning to shareholders? 

This is why I almost think you can’t go wrong with $AAPL 2023 calls. Your contract is for 100 shares... by expiration, so many shares will be bought back that it is really like a contract for 120 shares. 

For those apes that are new and don’t understand buybacks, it is essentially the opposite of shareholder dilution. Companies purchase shares of their own stock and then “burn” them into thin air. 

What are some other good buyback stocks? I recently learned that 252 companies in S&amp;P are doing buybacks, first time in history that the majority of them are doing so. But I want BIG, steady buybacks for my value LEAPs.

Listen up now because this play is going to make you so much money your step sister might finally suck your dick.

Dicks Sporting Goods (ticker DKS) announced a special dividend of $5.50/share along with a regular quarterly dividend of $0.4375/share, a 20.7% increase from the previous quarter's dividend of $0.3625. This makes for a combined $5.93 payout which is BIG even for a $133 stock.

As we get closer to the ex-div date of September 9 people will continue buying shares because they want the special dividend.

On top of this, Dicks is already riding serious momentum (up 21% on the week and 36% on the month) as it has consistently beaten earnings expectations by massive margins. People who feel like they missed out on buying the stock earlier in the pandemic will jump in now.

Dicks also announced this month that it is going to buy back 400 million shares this year, DOUBLE what they had previously stated. That alone is sure to send the stock price to the moon considering its moderately low liquidity (average volume \~ 4M). 11M volume yesterday sent this thing up 5% on the day!

Dicks has solid fundamentals, a huge special dividend on top of its bigger than normal regular dividend, is buying back double the amount of shares expected, and is riding HUGE momentum in share price and volume.

My strategy is to buy call options expiring on September 10 and sell them before the ex-div date of September 9.

For the 🌈🐻 in the chat that think Tesla is just a tech savvy car company, I’m here to show you another reason why you’re more retarded than the guy behind the Wendy’s. 



Currently the largest cell producers in the world top out at around 50GWh of cell production a year, they are ramping production to try to meet demand but we all know they wont be able to keep up. Tesla on the other hand knew this long ago and started working towards a solution. If the nazis over in Germany didn’t hold up Giga Berlin so long we’d be a lot further ahead, but regardless a huge battery plant that once ramped will shit out 250GWh of cells per year is almost complete. 

With Tesla’s ability to engineer the perfect “machine that builds the machine” they will have another huge competitive advantage within the EV space. Once this plant is ramped and pushing out cells Tesla will be set up the best by a mile to make it out of this. The only thing bearish about this is that materials will be scarce and will hold back production eventually, but while Tesla is dealing with this and still putting out numbers other auto makers will be struggling to get anything from other suppliers.

Down the road I imaging legacy and others will be buying cells from Tesla as well, this will be a ways down the road as Tesla needs every single cell they can get atm.

TLDR: Tesla will run the automotive market and be making battery’s for your wife’s sex toys 🚀🚀

On one hand, it’s a step forward to clearing out a problem (ie deadbeats).  Now the housing market is freed up and housing-providers can sell or fill their spaces.  This might result in an overall positive sentiment from the grand community, which means stocks go boom.  But on the other hand, this could trigger despair and a lack of confidence, which means stocks go bang. What are your thoughts?

Edit:  just a disclaimer that, while most people found my approach funny (as I intended) I do feel a little guilty having been a bit mean. There genuinely are folks out there who are struggling (as well as many who are abusing the system and taking advantage of others, simply because they hate “the rich,” which basically means anybody who has more than them).

FYI, they have already met all of their primary and secondary endpoints for phase 2/3, so no need to worry about not hitting it when additional data comes out.

Phase 2/3 Bladder cancer data came out to be 72% COMPLETE REMISSION with very LONG durable remission length. Compare that to the recent horrible data from Fate Therapeutics and Sesen bio's rejection of their BLA submission due to weak data.

Compare that to the current available therapy involving Keytruda at 42% complete remission. IBRX is much higher

First of all, $OSK is a huge company, and not immune from being shorted. Most if not everyone knows that $OSK is being sued by a company who says that basically they were awarded a multi billion dollar federal contract in error. So, in my opinion, I think Oshkosh $OSK is perfect for being shorted. Let me explain my reasons why, because they involve the Judge handling the lawsuit right now.

Let me introduce you all to Judge Zachary Somers.  Most notable here is that Judge Somers was appointed by Trump in Dec. 2020, so he has been a judge for a very short time. This is important because it means he has only been handling cases at the court for a short time so it is hard to know how he interprets the Constitution. Without getting into a long-winded discussion, the theory in law is that different judges have different perspectives about the Constitution, some believe the words apply literally the same today as they did before, some others think the Constitution changes and adapts to modern society. The point is that the best way to get an idea of how a judge might rule on an issue is by looking at PAST DECISIONS the judge has made in other cases that maybe involved similar issues. Even if those cases are not precedent cases (meaning a case that can be cited as an authority that applies to all the judges in a court), again, by looking at the cases, you can tell maybe what way a judge leans on certain issues, including the Constitution.

Now Judge Somers has some decisions posted on the Claims Court website.  In one case, believe it or not, Judge Somers RULED IN FAVOR OF THE PLAINTIFF IN A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT INVOLVING AN AWARD OF A ARMY TRAVEL CONTRACT. Basically, the GSA awarded an Army contract after bids were submitted to a company, but another company filed a lawsuit, arguing that the GSA had abused its discretion and made key errors that caused it to lose out on the contract. DOES THAT SOUND FAMILIAR TO ANYONE????? Anyways, Judge Somers granted an injunction and ordered the contract award be stopped. The Judge ordered the bids be re-evaluated in a manner consistent with the Judge's opinion and order, and the Plaintiff won!!!

So clearly, those who doubt that Judge Somers is the kind of person that would halt a government contract need not doubt anymore, because again, he just recently did that in a different government contract dispute case. Now does that mean Workhorse wins? No, of course not, BUT the fact the Judge has shown a willingness to rule in favor of a plaintiff in a government contract dispute has to make us feel better about Workhorse's chances, right?

Now, I know I have written ALOT about the Appointments Clause. So I do not want to go too much into it in this post, but I have read some Reddit comments that doubt the argument because they doubt Judge Somers would consider it in favor of Workhorse.

WELL........YUP.........I FOUND SOMETHING THAT MAKES ME BELIEVE JUDGE SOMERS WOULD TOTALLY BUY INTO THE APPOINTMENTS CLAUSE (AC) ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF WORKHORSE. Here is why, please CHECK OUT THE LAW SCHOOL ARTICLE THAT Judge Somers wrote back in Law School in 2004 in Georgetown. The title of the article is ""The Mythical Wall of Separation: How the Supreme Court has Amended the Constitution."" Judge Somers wrote this article when he was editor of the Georgetown Law Review. I PRINTED IT OUT, READ IT, AND THE LINK ABOVE GIVES YOU ACCESS TO IT, ALTHOUGH YOU MAY HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO UPLOAD A FULL DOCUMENT LINK ON REDDIT, SO I WILL SEE IF ANOTHER WORKHORSE APE CAN HELP ME WITH THAT.

Anyways, the article is long and full of legal language. But I will give you my summary about it, and again, if you doubt it, please get the article, it is available but has to be purchased at this point until I figure out how (or even if) I can upload it.

Judge Somers (or rather, student Zachary Somers at the time), wrote an article criticizing the Supreme Court because it had created its own interpretation of the Establishment Clause (EC) of the Constitution. The EC says the Government can't create a national religion or church, so it protects separation of church and state and free religious exercise. However, in 1947, the Supreme Court decided a case called EVERSON involving the EC. Zachary Somers wrote that the EVERSON case was wrong because it had ignored the original text of the EC, what the framers of the Constitution intended it to mean. He cites what England thought the EC meant, and even what Madison and Jefferson thought the EC should mean. MOST IMPORTANTLY IN HIS CONCLUSION, Zachary Somers says that we should go back to the original meaning of the EC, what conservatives want, and that we should not allow court's to change the interpretation intended by the Framers of the Constitution.

THIS.....IS....WHY.....I.....AM.....EXCITED!!!!!

Because think about everyone, the Appointments Clause is OLD SCHOOL CONSTITUTION LAW, like OLD SCHOOL, and I can tell you, the Framers did not intend for the AC to be construed differently, it was supposed to be construed as it is written, the PRESIDENT has to appoint, SENATE confirm, and lower officers follow a procedure in accordance with the AC. THE CURRENT USPS SCHEME DOES NOT AT ALL CONFORM TO WHAT THE FRAMERS INTENDED, NOT....ONE....BIT....

And yes, just because Zachary Somers law student thought this way does not mean Judge Somers thinks this way. But see, I get the feeling that the judge WANTS to make a decision, and WANTS TO MAKE A STATEMENT THAT IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPOINTMENTS CLAUSE because again, he has already shown a willingness to go against the government in a contract dispute in that unpublished case I included, AND he was taking time away from partying and having crazy law school threesomes to write a boring ass law review article about the freakin' Establishment Clause, I mean, damn, think about how boring that must have been for him.

So with that said, I think right now is a perfect time to short Oshkosh. No way they are holding on to that full contract, and if they settle, even if it is a 50/50 split, the stock loses a good amount. Also, what if the Judge denies the motion to dismiss and makes $OSK think they will lose the whole contract? It might make them give up more than a 50/50 split.

So yeah, do whatever you think is best, I am not a financial advisor, this is not legal advice, I honestly can't even get an Ubereats order correct, but do your own DD and jump in!!!!!!",My DD on $OSK OSHKOSH and why it will LOSE the Lawsuit - Check out Info About the Judge!!!,99,1

The stock is down almost 50% from its all time highs. Revenues have grown 24% year over year. The short percentage for this stock is the highest they have ever been. It looks like this is about to change! CRSR borrow fee jumped to 4.3% according to iborrowdesk. The last time fee was this high was in February 2021. This mean shorts have less of an incentive to keep their positions open and will cover as soon as the stock shows some strength.

Upcoming catalysts

\-Elgato (owned by crsr) launched a facecam. This is a high margin business they are getting in to.

\-CRSR is paying off their debts reducing their operating costs which means higher earnings per share

\-They are in a market that will continue to grow for many years (E-Sports and streaming)

\-As the xbox series X and PS5 become more available, they will sell more custom controllers and accessories

\-They are getting in to selling directly to consumers eliminating the middle man

\-Getting in to the software business, not just hardware

\-DDR 5

&amp;#x200B;

\-Revenue advanced 24% year over year, reaching $473 million. However, the stock fell sharply after the earnings news. This is despite the economy opening up!

\-While Corsair is dealing with higher logistics costs right now, but this is all about to end as the pandemic ends.

\-Highest earnings per share they have ever had

\-Forward PE of around 14-15 growth stocks like this typically trade at a 25-30 forward PE.

\-High percentage of insider ownership which means there is a high level of support.

&amp;#x200B;

Price to sales ratio is only about 1.5 when companies like this typically trade at a 7-9X sales ratio

&amp;#x200B;

Most importantly, if you get in now you are getting a better deal than those who got in at 30 or above

Few things I was curious if anyone has speculation or more clarifications: 

""Well, it's a major portion of our portfolio. As I said, we cover three major areas; cellular, wireless communications and networking. So things that is relevant but it's not useful to us today in our strategic software part of the business and we retained all the embedded and all the site ends and all the encryption and security technology patent."" - John Chen

* John Chen suggested there will be a large portions of the patents being sold, out of the 38,000 patents owned by BB. From an article suggested in 2013, the patents owned by BB are worth a good $2bil - $3bil, but there was some sold to Huawei which might either take a small nip out of this according to the reports. Potential inflation of these patents could be considered. One article from Seeking Alpha in 2019 suggested it's potential worth is $10bil if $BB play its cards right.

"" So this is an unusual year. So let's talk about, if the patent license goes through, if the sale goes through, we will have -- we will report a one-time gain of a reasonably big number, followed by a tail of up to seven years. So it will not go away to zero, there are some recurring -- that most of them will not be with us. But, so it will not be zero, but it will be quite small, if this happens -- sales go through with one big year in this fiscal year 2022. If the patent sale does not go through, then the first couple of quarters will be low, because if the pattern sale is being negotiated right now, I actually are unable to do more other negotiation going on. So the pipeline basically is frozen, but it won't go away. So if the patent sale does not go through, I may have to suffer a little bit for the first couple of two, three quarters and then we will then assume the target 250 a year patent licensing."" - John Chen 

* Patent licensing makes up 100M in their revenue (but not fully for all of the patents it seems) which is fairly a large amount of money. But let's say they do sell it, $BB get one big payment for one quarter, and installments for up to 7 years (seems to be the current terms of negotiation). Also it seems like there could also be a possibility the sell does NOT go through at all or negotiations won't be down for a few quarters. But then they still can request license money from FB if the agreement fails. For the future, if they do sell this, assuming they will sustain some other products and services for the next 7 years. As this constant selling of their own product revenue isn't sustainable. 

""The company limits its licensing activities in the quarter due to the negotiations and because of accounting rules which Steve will explain later."" - John Chen

""Further to John's comments regarding negotiations relating to a potential sale, licensing activities have been limited not only due to the ongoing negotiations, but also because revenue from additional transactions that could have been completed in the quarter would have been treated as contingent revenue and deferred to future periods. Therefore, had negotiations not been in progress, we believe licensing revenue would have been higher."" - Steve Rai

* Earlier in the presentation, John Chen mentioned that the purchasing ""company"" has some licensing/accounting rules. If this was FB - are we expecting sometime at the end of FB's quarter or next quarter? I noticed FB already close out it's quarter since this statement, so technically it's been almost 2 quarters now since this reported. If they keep pushing this out, I am assuming their revenue report will keep taking a hit because the sale is not considered. Until then, my speculation is the patent sale will be announced at Q2 2022 for $BB, or some time early September, but no actual numbers until the reports earnings.


I also read Q1 2022 transcript, but it was disappointing and lacked info. Seem to focus more on QNX and IVY.

Cushy notes from Q1 2022 transcript:

98,post,pccqus,2th52,wallstreetbets,False,2021-08-26 17:59:16,https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pccqus/mu_the_most_undervalued_semi_stock_has_2030/,self.wallstreetbets,," Most great semi stocks are already priced in or overvalued, and we smart experienced apes know that you never buy overvalued stocks because its potential gain is small and its potential loss is too big.

Therefore, we need to buy the stock that is undervalued but eventually goes up to meet its price target later because of its strong fundamentals and future growth (which is MU). And why do we need to pick semi stocks for this? Because Semiconductor business is one of the most potential and profitable business in the whole industry; we simply think that everything is turning to digital and AI systems, and all those devices, platforms, and servers need memory chips. Biden's infrastructure bills and his willingness to support semi industry are also tailwinds of semi stocks.

Ok, so why MU is the most undervalued stock among all semiconductors now?

Because it is ridiculously cheap! 7x forward price to earnings multiple now, and even though it actually have a slowdown in memory chip industry, it is still 10-12x forward earnings which is still ridiculously cheap compared to other semi stocks. (According to Quint Tatro, Joule Financial founder at CNBC).

MU's 52 week high is 96.96, and its current price is 72.77. It showed some high volatility and corrections after its ATH because it went up too fast in short time (52 week low is 43.67). The last large correction made MU's price down from 83 to 68.80 which was 17% down in 4 days. This correction happened because of Morgan Stanley's report that says 'winter is coming' for semis. However, all other institutions and investors, including Goldman Sachs, Bofa, Jim Cramer, think that MU is way undervalued, and its price is at the bottom now. Vanguard Group, Sanders Capital, and State Street, top 5 MU shareholders, added MU positions between August 6 to August 16 . Since many institutions and large investors start to buy MU back, its price went up from 68 to 77, and then it dropped to 73 today due to the red market and some sell offs.

Reasons why this is a great timing to buy MU now

1. The sentiment turned to bullish. It kept going up since it hit its bottom price 68, and yesterday, August 25th, it pumped from 73 to 77 in few minutes, closed at 74, and the current price is 72.77 now. Great buying point before it keeps pumping after this Jackson Hole meeting.
2. Too CHEAP compared to ALL other semis. Here is the picture.

[As you can see, MU is -23.64&amp;#37; from 52 week High on August 25, it has a more discount today since it dropped to 72.77. Ok, then we might doubt about its fundamentals and its future growth. Don't worry, here is why most analysts and institutions think MU is super undervalued and it is time to buy now.](

[Its FY1 is 12.13 which is already great, but its FY2 and 3 is 6.36 and 6.34 which is too great compared to others. So, it is a great time to buy it before all those number soar later.](

Their EPS and Revenue growth are also great too (beating all estimates for over 2 years).



3. Morgan Stanley, aka sneaky bitches, revealed a report 'winter is coming' or whatever, saying that DRAM memory chip price was already at the peak and it is going down now which will lead all DRAM company's profit to go down due to its historical data. However, most institutions and investors still believe that DRAM's demand is still too strong enough to cover that DRAM price drop, because all PCs, Servers, Laptops, smartphones, tablets, robots, cars, and anything that has automated computer system needs 'memory chip'. Semi industry has a bright future, and I think Morgan Stanley's report was just a manipulation in order to short the stock and buying it back at discounted price. This asshole bought SK hynix (2nd largest DRAM company) shares back after its correction in Korea. Its price was 120,000 Won before MS's report, and it dropped to 98,000 after its report and they started buying back from 100,000 now. I still strongly believe that this stock will keep going up before tapering. (I hope the Fed does not mention about tapering at Jackson Hole).

4. RSI number is important because we can know if the stock is overbought or not. The current market sentiment is unstable due to upcoming tapering, interest rates, inflation, national debts, infrastructure, etc. and most overbought stock have a high chance to meet its huge corrections later. Ok, so MU's current monthly RSI is 57. It is still in the middle which is a great number for tech growth stock. For example, Nvidia's monthly RSI is 86, AMD's monthly RSI is 85, AMAT is 75, TSM is 76, Qualcomm is 65, and ASML is 93. RSI does not explain everything, but it helps you to know that MU is pretty undervalued.

5. Most great investors always say 'being simple is the best strategy'. I also believe that. Simply, we will make the money if we buy the GOOD stock in cheap way and sell it in expensive way. And simply, MU, a GOOD stock, is cheap now.

6. Here is a better explanation about MU itself (my first MU DD) that shows why MU is a GOOD stock. [

There is a high chance that the Fed will not mention about tapering at Jackson Hole meeting because of Delta variant problems and slower than expected economy recovery. If they don't, tech stocks have a higher chance to get pumped for a while, and indeed, undervalued stocks have the highest chance to soar. So I personally strongly believe that few more tailwinds can drive MU price up to 20-30% before its next earnings (Sep 27), and 60-100% in 3-6 months depending on market sentiment.

Its current price targets are: Yahoo avg 115.59, Seeking Alpha avg 111.76, Marketwatch avg 115.85,  
Tip Ranks: 112.64, Marketbeat: 112.07, CNN: 112.50. Total Average PT: 113.40.

It is simple, but actually not easy. Buy it now since it is turning to bullish, and sell the news before it actually tanks again. If the tapering is coming? Buy the PUTs or wait until the price became cheap again with healthy correction. And then we get in the ride again when it starts pumping again. I think that is how you can survive in this stupid unpredictable market. I sometimes use option straddle strategy during this unpredictable market because all you need to do is choosing high volatility stocks (I might use this strategy for MU later since it has a high volatility, and the current market is unpredictable).

My positions: 24 Sep 72c x 7 , 24 Sep 68c x 10, owning 100 shares.

Indeed, this is just my DD, no financial advice.

Kaplan’s comments come as the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee weighs the timing of taking the first steps in slowing its accommodative monetary policy, which has involved near-zero interest rates and a “quantitative easing” program that is currently absorbing about $120 billion in assets every month.

The Dallas Fed chief said if anything, those asset purchases are creating “excesses and imbalances” in the housing market, where home valuations have ripped higher.

I'll preface by saying I'm seriously disturbed by where the evidence is pointing, and the complete denial of any plausibility of these allegations by many SAVA investors. This entire company and the science behind it may be a fraud. Checkout Stocktwits or Yahoo Finance conversations to see how unaware of this possibility retail investors are.

Take the CEO of Cassava Sciences, Remi Barbier. His last moment in the spotlight came as the CEO of a company called Pain Therapeutics. This company's product was a drug called Remoxy, a supposedly abuse-resistant form of oxycodone. Remoxy was rejected by the FDA four times in a row for a lack of proper evidence suggesting it was actually abuse-resistant. Pain Therapeutics was then sued for misleading investors and causing damages and paid out in a settlement. Pain Therapeutics was later renamed to Cassava Sciences, which pivoted to Alzheimer's disease treatment with a drug they developed called Simufilam.

[

[

Does this information prove that SAVA is fraudulent? Absolutely not. Does it suggest that Remi could potentially fit the profile of Biotech CEO con artist based on his history? Maybe.

What about a motive? If Simufilam isn't as effective as claimed, if some or all of the data backing it is fabricated, and/or it eventually fails clinical trials, what is there to gain?

Each valuation threshold must be achieved and maintained for no less than 20 consecutive business days for participants to be eligible for a cash bonus award. Each valuation threshold triggers a separate cash bonus award in a pre-set amount defined in the Plan.""

[

Okay, so if the stock gets pumped to sky-high valuations, Remi and others get massive paydays regardless of how the drug fairs in clinical trials.

Well, what about the ""wildly successful"" 9 month cognitive data and 6 month biomarkers? What did a group of Alzheimer's scientists think about the open label (rather than double blind) study with no placebo control group?

""Alzheimer’s scientists critique Cassava Sciences’ study results — overblown, inappropriate, uninterpretable""

[

Ever had that gut feeling something was too good to be true? How plausible is it that a tiny company of merely dozens of people, after abandoning a failed pain medication and settling lawsuits, jumps to an Alzheimer's disease drug, the unfound and impossibly difficult holy grail of modern medicine, and delivers total disease modifying success the likes of which the world and all of its collective scientific effort has never remotely seen?

Then comes the bombshell.

On August 18th, Jordan A. Thomas files his petition on behalf of a client/whistleblower to the FDA to halt trials and to perform a full audit of all scientific publications related to Simufilam. This is due to overwhelming evidence of scientific misconduct.

Who is Jordan A. Thomas, is he credible or a blood sucking lawyer?

""While at the SEC, Thomas played a role in the development of the SEC Whistleblower Program, established under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Thomas also developed and served as the first National Coordinator of the SEC's Cooperation Program, designed to encourage individuals and companies to self-report violations of the federal securities laws and to participate in the SEC's investigations and enforcement actions.""

""After leaving the SEC, Thomas joined Labaton Sucharow LLP as a partner.""

""In private practice, he has risen to national prominence. The Wall Street Journal has described him as “one of the most prominent attorneys representing whistleblowers before the government.” Likewise, NPR has referred to him as “one of the top whistleblower lawyers in the country.” And the New York Times has described his team as “one of the top legal practices in the country representing corporate whistle-blowers.” Over the years, he represented the first officer of a public company to win an SEC whistleblower award, the first SEC whistleblower to receive criminal immunity and the first SEC whistleblower to receive an award because his company retaliated against him. **In 2018, his clients won the then-largest SEC Whistleblower award in history for a single case, $83 million.**""

[

Does it get any more legitimate than that? Why are so many other high profile law firms opening investigations?

What was in Thomas's petition?

Google ""Requests that the FDA halt the current clinical studies of Simufilam PTI-125 sponsored by Cassava Sciences"".

Here's a teaser:

Falsified Western Blot on page 9.

""The western blot in Figure 1a (below right) of Dr. Wang’s 2010 paper in Biological Psychiatry 67:522 contains four bands that closely resemble an image published in Figure 12a (left) of the Wang and Burns 2005 Neuroscience 135: 247 paper mentioned in C.2.1. These eight boxed bands come from different experimental conditions that were allegedly conducted many years apart, using different samples. The authors appear to have vertically compressed the bands in the 2010 paper, but expanding them here shows they are strikingly similar to those in the 2005 paper. As the sample passes through the gel, it creates a small amount of streaking which causes a distinctive irregular shape in the upper portion of each band; the pattern of this streaking is identical in the two images. **This degree of congruence could not have occurred by chance or error; it suggests a complex cross-publication dimension to Cassava Science’s band duplication behavior and, in this case, it is hard to imagine that the duplication was not intentional.** It is recommended that the original full-length images with appropriate molecular weight markers are obtained to validate band migration from both the 2005 and 2010 papers for independent review. Because of the seriousness of this duplication, if the original materials are not available, both of these papers must be retracted.""



Yes, that's right. Two publications based on supposedly different experiments 5 years apart have pixel perfect copies of the same data. This would be enough evidence to expel a student from university. What about when billions of dollars are at stake?

And

""It is worth repeating, the preclinical and clinical foundations linking Filamin A to Alzheimer’s disease derive only from the publications of Drs. Wang and Burns. As shown above, ALL of these papers have evidence of apparent intentional scientific misrepresentation. Cassava Sciences’ Alzheimer’s disease clinical biomarker data with PTI-125/simufilam showed no evidence of efficacy when tested by an outside lab, and only showed apparent efficacy when re-analyzed in an academic lab—likely Dr. Wang’s lab as he is listed as the first author on the poster (26 July 2021) describing the re-analyzed data. Now, Cassava Science’s 26 July 2021 analysis of clinical biomarker results with PTI-125/simufilam also shows evidence of data manipulation.""

Guess who Dr. Lindsay Burns Sr. VP of Neuroscience at Cassava is married to? Cassava Sciences CEO Remi Barbier.

Oh, and Dr. Hoau-Yan Wang? He's on Cassava's scientific advisory board.

The evidence in the petition is endless.

Just last week I learned how to read, write and do math so sorry for possible mistakes. Nevertheless, I believe Avepoint (AVPT) will fly again and I think it has a 50% upside potential over the next year. This is not a stupid pump n dump play and I would really hope not to see idiots gambling on AVPT and then blaming ""short ladder attacks"" if it goes down.

&amp;#x200B;



Every ticker after ""deSPACKing"" has suffered. Lucid went down from 56 to 21, PTRA from 28 back to its NAV price of 10, BARK from 18.5 to 7.31. Avepoint (AVPT) from 16.5 to below 9.66 as of writing.

Avepoint has been in business for 20 years and is the largest independent software vendor of SaaS solutions to migrate, manage and protect data in Microsoft 365. It has offices in the US, Canada, Australia, South Africa, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, Japan, Singapore, and China.

2 weeks ago Avepoint reported their Q2 earnings. They managed to beat the estimates once again:

· Total Revenue of $45.3 million, up 38% year-over-year

· SaaS Revenue of $20.6 million, up 76% year-over-year

· Non-GAAP Operating Income of $3.3 million;

You would expect a stock price to go up when it beats earnings, especially, if it trades below its former net asset value (NAV). Well unfortunately (or fortunately, if you are trying to accumulate) the stock went South together with all the other de-spac companies after their mergers.

&amp;#x200B;

[I was told crayons are important](

They expect further growth for the Q3: total revenues between $51.5 and $53.5 million and annual 2021 revenues of about $200 million. That means they are trading at just 8.8 P/S of 2021 with an annual growth of 38%. And if we project at least a 30% until 2025, that would mean their revenues would reach $571 million. Given that they are a SAAS company, that sounds excellent and way better than industry average.

Given that their business is based on a long term relationship with Microsoft, as Azure is growing, AvePoint will continue to grow as well. Therefore, Avepoint should be considered a long term investment. It’s market capitalization of less than 2 billion does bring volatility, however, the future outlook is green.

There are 5 analyst [ratings]( and all of them are a ""BUY"". They have an average price target of $15 per share and the highest price target was given by Goldman Sachs ($17).

Unlike PLTR, where insiders have been selling heavily, AVPT CEO just last week purchased additionally $936k worth of shares himself. That shows strong conviction in the company and that he believes the shares are undervalued.

This means more overdoses and therefore a higher demand for NARCAN™️, produced by EBS. 

Also, the company is sitting around half the 12 month price target consensus amongst analysts. EBS also works in COVID vaccines with J&amp;J, and all this talk about boosters probably being needed just brings more good news for this play.

The stock I’m talking about is COIN (Coinbase)

COIN is so undervalued it’s insane. It has a 30 PE ratio while literally 11x revenue YoY when corn halved from it’s May peak. It’s priced like fucking AAPL or FB who are growing 30-50% YoY not fucking **tentupling**. Not to mention during the quarter where corn halved from its peak, they increased their profit by 4900% year over year, so the bear argument “if corn drops they’ll stop making money” has already been disproven.  

In terms of financials, COIN is literally the fastest growing stock I have ever seen. Let’s take a quick look

**Q2 Earnings:**

Revenue: $2.23 billion (up 1097% YoY)

EPS: $3.45/share 

Net Income: $1.61 billion (up 4880% YoY)

Net profit margins: 72%

**Bear Arguments**

*Growth will slow down*

Obviously growth is going to slow down, but there has been no big tech companies that we see today (the FAANGs) that has grown nearly as fast it this is. They have so much money, they don’t know to do with it. Their profit margins are exceptional on that kind of revenue and even if growth halves, they’ll still be making an absolute metric fuck ton of pure revenue and profit. 


*Their money is dependent on transaction fees*

For now, but they’re branching out. This is a brand new company we’re talking about. I literally know somebody personally who had their company acquired by Coinbase. They’re spreading their roots to more revenue streams so they’re not entirely dependent on transaction fees. Not to mention they already have Coinbase Pro, so people who want low fees can already get them. 


*What if Corn drops*

Corn halved last quarter and they still saw enormous revenue and profits. The *only* reason why I think this could be a problem is if you think corn will flat out stop existing. Corn could drop to 10,000 and as long as people still trade the currency, COIN will be making money


*Competition*

That’s the bear argument to every single superior product. It’s a non-issue. Tesla has competition. Apple has competition. The market is big enough for multiple exchanges. Coinbase ranks up there as one of the best; literally the only better alternative (having a physical wallet) is so inconvenient that nobody in that community does it. The only thing bears can say is “fees” but it’s obvious they have absolutely no idea what they’re talking about and have never even used the app, because if they did, they’d know that Coinbase Pro exists and their fees are almost non-existent.

All of this makes me believe Salesforce will receive a vastly quicker return on investment on Slack than the market assumes. On top of this, Salesforce is combining their other cloud tools (including Tableau, leading data analytics tool) into Slack.

Salesforce is trading at a lower valuation gap compared to it's competition, despite being better positioned in the wider long-term economy due to Slack.

**Overview**

Medifast is a weight-loss company similar to Weight Watchers, but much more profitable and with better management. The company is an MLM that uses coaches (aka Facebook moms) to sell weight-loss plans. This means they market and ship directly to the customer at retail prices, so margins aren't compressed by third-party distributors/wholesalers. About 90% of coaches started as clients, which is a crazy statistic.  They have about 60,000 coaches and each brings in about $3,500 a quarter. Check out the Yahoo Finance conversations page to see how much people really love this company.

**Fundamentals** 

Medifast is currently trading at around 2x sales with a PE of around 17. They consistently offer conservative guidance (the main reason for the stock being down 30% from its 52 week high is that they warned the cost of their raw materials may increase due to inflation) but they significantly beat earnings more often than not. Just look at their performance over the last 10 years. My favorite part about this company is that their ROIC, ROA, and ROE have been growing consistently since 2011.  They also pay out a dividend of close to 3% and have grown net profit margins from 12.7% to 15.5% of revenue since the beginning of the year.  The potential upside is 77% according to Yahoo Finance.

**The Play** 

Medifast currently has just under 12M shares outstanding, which means that the stock can move insanely fast with even a small amount of volume. We saw an almost 50% gain in May and we're currently about 33% below the 52 week high.  I don't see the stock going more than 5% below where it currently is given they crushed earnings last quarter and they're repurchasing shares.  The only thing this stock needs to run is volume. A quick reversal here is inevitable even without WSB attention, so get in while you can. 

TL;DR: $MED is insanely undervalued as a debt-free company with a Revenue CAGR of 46% since 2017, not to mention consistent net profit margin growth. There are also only 12M shares outstanding and insiders hold about 5%, so this thing will move quickly with enough volume.",Profiting Off Covid Weight and Facebook Moms,17,7

Below is an explanation of BARK with some data that I gathered from my conversation with Matt Meeker, the co-founder of BARK. 
Overview
Barkbox is a brand that is synonymous with dogs and funtertainment gave the monthly subscription box of toys, treats, and chews. Nevertheless, Barkbox gets a reputation as a fad/niche business. A company that started as a hobby/passion for dog owners is now a business with over $500 million in revenues and 2 million subscribers.  I see Barkbox as a trojan horse business where you successfully have 1 product and then extend the line. Apple did this a few times, with computers, then MP3, then phones. Crox did it with their shoe and Deckers Outdoor with the UGG boot; both thrived.  The common denominator was a disciplined management team, a great product, and a strong brand. Barkbox has the common denominator in spades. 
Timeline of Barkbox
Three scrappy entrepreneurs started Barkbox.  They would tinker their product until they would get it right, and many times they would fail, and that is fine, but one thing they noticed was that entertaining the audience and making attractive toys were key selling points.  Sure, there are many treats out there in the industry, but the offer becomes irresistible when you mix toys and treats.  Over time they noticed that they lost subscribers due to a few factors: 1.	How many toys are too many toys?2.	The pet may be getting older and loses interest; it happens. 3.	The dog goes to doggy heavenIn facing these realities, the company had some hard questions to answer.  How many potential customers are there out there that would purchase this subscription?  What other products can we create or sell that allow the customer to stay frequently with us?  
Is Barbox special?
Well, if you own a dog, you probably have heard of them.  Their social media footprint is close to 9 million followers across all platforms. Their angle is entertainment, mixed with practicality and affordability.  The perfect recipe to cater to all generations of dog owners, from young to elderly.  Their toys range from WWE-themed toys to Weed paraphernalia to mainstream-looking toys that attract the mass market shopper at Target, etc. Barkbox is unique because it attracts a demographic similar to Pinterest, as most of the customers are female, more than 75%.  These are the soccer and pageant moms and millennials who choose a dog over having children or at least postponing having children.  This is not just a USA trend, but a global one, accelerated due to COVID as people realized being lonely is not fun and a dog brings all the benefits of companionship and entertainment. Customer opportunity
BARK caters to super fans, which is people who love and are borderline obsessed with their pets.  Although 65 million households in the USA own dogs, I think the market opportunity for BARK’s current subscription box is in the 30% range or 13 million subscribers.  They currently have 1.95 million and over ten years have had an additional 2 million already sign up and cancel, which leaves around 9 million left to go with the CURRENT subscription box offering; when you consider barkeats and barkbright and the other channels, they can keep growing the ecosystem.  The loss of a subscriber is not necessarily bad because if the brand is strong enough, it will get the customer to come back to maybe buy one toy, treat, or home product they are interested in or sign up for BarkBright or BarkEats, so yes they may have lost the $240 annuity. Still, they may be able to get them to buy $50 to $100 a year in other products.   That is less money going to Amazon or Chewy. Customer Revenue Channels

Subscription	Toys and Treats	Super Chewer	Bark Bright	Bark Eats	Combo of 2 of the above or more. 
DTC store – Barkshop.comRetail – Target, Costco, etc.
What is the Barkbox moat?
If I had to sum it up, it would be its ability to listen to its audience and cater to attract products they would be interested in buying or looking forward to in their upcoming shipment. Zappos started selling shoes and became so good at listening to their customer they got acquired by Amazon.  Service matters, and Barkbox has knocked it out of the park compared to peers. 
What did Matt and I talk about? Lots. 
Given my previous conversation with the Investor Relations department, Mike Mougias, I had already cleared up some of the housekeeping questions and wanted to take the time to ask Matt as many questions about the business, obstacles, etc. 

Let me be upfront in saying I have been sending a few e-mails to the management team, and this meeting was supposed to be 30 minutes and ended up being 1 hour. I think we could have gone longer, but I would prefer them to keep growing the business, and I appreciate the time they gave me.  I have also sent them e-mails regarding their interview on Cramer’s show, five pages of notes of their Investor Presentation that needs a lot of work; this may have been one of the reasons there was none after the quarterly earnings report.  My main concern or talking points revolves around the bear thesis, which is that the business model is a fad or niche and will not be sustainable and what is Barkbox’s plan to extend the membership from 16 months to 20, then 24, etc.  
The response I got was that BarkEats would help extend the average price per subscriber and extend the duration. Although I know, that is an easy response we have heard in conference calls and investor meetings, I brought up that changing people’s habits to buy dog food would have to offer a significant value proposition, whether it is a better price or better quality food.  People who routinely shop at Costco or Chewy will not cancel a monthly shipment of dog food so quickly.  I agree that a segment of customers will prefer the convenience of small packages, changing food as the pet matures and set it and forget subscription vs. not having to haul a 30-pound bag of food in a store, etc. However, for the segment of dog owners that aren’t too super fanatical, saving money counts. I explained to them my personal experience of how I buy dog food via Amazon and that the pricing for BarkEats was more expensive per pound, and I failed to grasp the added value of their offering.  They agreed they need to keep working on it, and this is why the BARKEATS has been tinkered with for over a year.  The program was initially launched in April of 2020 and has not grown fast because the company has been tinkering with the offering, or maybe they are seeing that people are not as receptive to it?  Sometimes you have to have the right balance of cynicism and optimism/vision. Could they grow this fast?  Yes, but then what they don’t want is massive cancellations after that, so I am ok with being patient in getting it right, but if the product offering was terrific, we should be pretty close to an actual aggressive launch.   
I then asked if there are any plans for a rewards program?  No, plans.  Now, I think that is a mistake because if you lose 2 million subscribers over ten years, there is a sense of no reward for the loyalty of any kind OR not enough products to warrant a program and pressed further.  How do you expect people to stay longer if you are not rewarding them, get their friends to stay longer, or reward other purchasing behavior outside of the subscription?  It ends up that the company had silo’d a lot of division within the company, and some were resistant to offering discounts on new products released, etc.  So, if I got a subscription and say added a bed, they would not give me a discount, but they would if I would try BarkBright.  They admitted that this was not the best approach and are working on combining or allowing additional benefits to subscribers via some discounting.  Nevertheless, I was disappointed to know there was no plan for a rewards program, and after the e-mail was so bothered by it, I sent a detailed proposal of a plan I think would work for Bark.  

Here is my e-mail below:After the call, I kept thinking of a few ideas on how to help bring back some old members and keep the current ones longer.  I think the best solution is to have the ultimate rewards program for Pets ever made.  Every airline and credit card has one, and why can't dog parents?  So, I thought of BarkBucks.  I know Apple does not have a rewards program or “discount” unless it’s a digital subscription. However, if you consider the cult following of Chik-fil-A, they have a rewards program and still have thousands of customers out the door every day, so I think a good program will go a long way and given your market is primarily women, you have to cater to their needs which is a mix of passion and competitiveness. Like you said, some would get jealous if their box didn't have a toy and someone else did. Below is more or less some brainstorming of how I think it could work at the surface but not sure about the financial impact if, for example, you go back to a subscriber that you lost two years ago that paid for two years and canceled, do you have them come back and give them a Tier below for one year? Perhaps this program works out better when there are more products released?  These are questions you will have the answers to or need to find, but I hope this is helpful to get the ball rolling. BarkBucksThe best loyalty programs are ones that have the following features:·        Competitive environment where higher status gets them more rewards and better deals or better toys?!?!?! Personalized with dog name on them?!?!·        Exclusive discounts to products or storewide.·        Exclusive events or products only sent to those Tiers (this encourages people to want to spend more within the ecosystem vs. chewy; this is why the key to keep launching home products, etc.)·        Allow people to accumulate points to spend on products within the ecosystem, outside of the ecosystem, and share the points with friends and family. ·        Transfer, gift, the points to anyone for a fee.·        Exchange the points for cash (gift card of AMEX, VISA, etc.) You can charge a hefty amount for this.Chik-fil-A has a good program that I think works perfectly for BarkBox, and I thought of more or less how it would work.Tier 110 Points for every dollar spentTier 2Earn 5,000 points in a year (paid $500)Earn 11 points per dollar spentReceive 5% discount at Barkshop.comReceive an additional 5% discount if you sign up for two or more subscriptions of 6 months or more.Tier 3Earn 10,000 Points in a year (spent $1,000)Earn 12 points per dollar spentReceive 10% discount at Barkshop.comReceive an additional 10% discount if you sign up for two or more subscriptions of 6 months or more.Exclusive products or access to products before released to product (use the points to get them)Access to special events in specific cities. Program info:Points expire within 24 months of the last end received.Points can be sent to friends and family as gifts with a 10% fee in matters. So, if they ship 500 points, they are charged 50 points (this helps get some of the “funds” back).Points can be redeemed for products at a rewards page which includes Bark products but also some products outside of it that are DOG specific (it will be the most UNIQUE rewards program in the world for Dogs and maybe even Pets) like working with local groomers small family-owned vets or perhaps a partnership with some companies.
End of e-mail. 
Other topics in the discussion:
Margins.  I asked how much their shipping costs were per box.  They said that $6 per box was a high number, so I am now modeling $5 to $5.50 in my model, which means that the TRUE gross margin with shipping drops to around 45% to 50%, which is still significantly better than Chewy and Amazon. Keep in mind that they sell one of the highest margin products at any retail pet store; this is why they don’t want to open retail stores but keep building a brand akin to Nike. 
Dog Insurance. The management team has spoken about this to investors and has said they do not want to do this. I think the mindset of BARK is the correct one in that it does not want to be the one to tell clients, “Hey, sorry, but we are not covering the vet bill for Sparky due to X, Y, Z factors.” It sounds like a poor customer experience, but in the insurance industry, you sometimes have to reject claims, especially if they suspect them to be fraudulent or abusive. However, there is a way that works for everyone involved in that the company works with an insurance company and collects a flat fee commission for every customer that purchases the policy with BARK. Trupanion paid in 2020 $200 a customer, and I don’t think it is unfeasibly for BARK to get 250,000 customers to choose the insurance option as part of their subscription.  Getting, say, $150 in affiliate commission per customer on year one and, say, $50 every year thereafter brings in 100% gross profit into the business straight to the bottom line, tens of millions per year. Also, it gets the customer to go back to the website to renew, etc. 

Home Products.  The company has launched products at a rapid pace and today has more than 30 products in concept, which means a rollout of around ten that could be rolled out per year as these products need to be tested and sourced economically to be feasible to maintain the 60% or higher margin for the business. This division is probably the most underrated today as this division along with a rewards program, can help extend the life of subscriptions but also get them to stay within the BARK brand of products. 
Conclusion, overall, I walked away confident in the BARK story.  Yes, there is a lot of work they have to do, and that is why you are getting a discount today.  There is a lot of fear, panic, and uncertainty of the business, and I believe over a few quarters of results will show the power of the BARK brand and revenue channels, etc.

The final day for the bill to pass is set on September 27th so expect it to pass officially and written into law from now until then. The thing is that big gas and oil isn't getting into the RNG business. They don't want to just yet. They need RNG in order to meet the EPA regulations of bio-fuels mixtures, but realize that environmental regulations are only going to tighten. While the EPA is recommending to lower the mandated amount of bio-fuel mixed for the near future, because of a production slump due to COVID, it will rise again. What a better time to invest in RNG? It is a emerging market, but demand for most fuel is stagnant because of COVID's effect on travel.

Macy's is flying high after being upgraded by several analyst including JPMorgan which puts the 12 month price target at $25, up from $19. That's great news for the company. Also great news for soft-brains looking for quick buck is that Macy's is already within $1.33 (As of this typing) of that price target today which means that after hitting a 52-week high today, a pullback is imminent.

The last few spikes have been followed by heavy short term corrections. The last two super spikes in price where in January and March when the price surged up only to retreat from:

\-$17.73 to $13.70 in 5 trading days January 7th-February 2nd

Alright well tesla is getting ready to break out and rally once again, now the question is when. It dropped from 900 to around 500 due to inflation fears as well as the market correcting itself . Now it has been range bound for the the last 3 months consolidating and creating strong levels of support .

[last 5 days](

Last week chip shortages caused a lot of stocks in the automotive industry to drop as the market priced it in , thus tesla dropped from the 700s to 640 before quickly rebounding back up to 700 . Furthermore tesla has been consolidating the past few days creating higher highs and higher lows .

the last  3 days

8/23- open 685.44 close 706.30

8/24- open 710.68 close 708.49

8/25- open 707.03 close 711.20

last 3 days tesla has been closing at higher levels each day. Furthermore Tesla held its support at 700, 705 and today created support at around 710. ( Its been consolidating and testing the 715 resistance ).

Its only a matter of time before tesla breaks out of this 3 month long channel and so far has created  strong levels of support at 550 , 620, 650 , 675-680 and as of now has turned the 700 level support into a support .

Ive been play calls this whole week as tesla tends to pump then drop and consolidate around vwap  these last few days . But i think it will soon break out either this week or next week.

This isnt financial advice and i am not a financial advisor 

This is just my view of the stock what do yall think of tesla and papa elon.",Tesla doing well,63,7

Assuming the average selling price of $24 /share, this amounts to almost $100M.

Here is the breakdown:

Alexander Karp (CEO): sold 2,891,887 shares (roughly $69.4M)

Shyam Sankar (COO and Executive Vice President): sold 585,330 shares (roughly $14M)

Stephen Cohen (President and Secretary): sold 345,018 shares (roughly $8M)

David Glazer (CFO and Treasurer): sold 201,190 shares (roughly $4.8M)

Ryan Taylor (Chief Legal and Business Affairs Officer): sold 83,061 shares (roughly $2M)

To put it into perspective, the avg trading volume of PLTR is roughly 44 million shares. Given the amount of selling is quite significant especially when it came from c-suite executive, I think it's worth to share the news.

Some people said they did it to pay taxes. Some asked why can't they just borrow money (using the shares as collateral) to pay off taxes (Elon did that. And interest rate is ridiculously low right now)? Some said they wanted to buy a fixer-upper condo LOL.

FYI, PLTR has a float of 1.53 billion shares.

**Point 1:** Vascepa is an Omega-3 fatty acid lipid-lowering agent and contains only one ingredient, EPA. This is a crucial point because EPA lowers triglycerides, but DHA can increase LDL cholesterol. Since Vascepa only has EPA, it lowers **triglycerides** but does not increase LDL cholesterol.  


**Point 2:** Triglycerides are a type of fat (lipid) found in your blood.  


**Point 3:** RNA viruses exploit lipid droplets (LDs) to acquire lipids for viral membrane or energy production to support their replication.  


**Point 4:** Covid-19 is a RNA virus. It needs lipids too!  


**Point 5:** The membrane (made of lipids) is an essential part of the Covid-19 virus.  


**Point 6:** Vascepa lowers the lipids in the body that Covid-19 needs to create more of the membrane. If there is a lower supply, viral replication will likely be slowed down.

**Point 7:** If viral production is slowed down, the immune system is more likely to have time to develop and deliver an immune response that does not invoke a life-threatening cytokine storm; this is basically an overreaction of your immune system that kills tissue and damages your organs.  


**Point 8:** Vascepa may help prevent symptomatic Covid-19 infection and where symptomatic Covid-19 is present, it may help prevent the disease from progressing to severe Covid-19 leading to hospitalization and potential death.

**Point 9:** We are on the cusp of finding out if Vascepa can mitigate the severity of Covid-19 as a 1-year study has finished and preliminary data is about to be released next week at the European Society of Cardiology Congress (ESCC). If the data is good, we can anticipate that Vascepa may become an essential preventative medicine for at-risk and elderly populations, that constitute the majority of Covid-19 related deaths and hospitalizations.

This is  an entertainment/comedy-nonfactual post. I'm a retard  posting on WSB  with a bias due to having a position of my portfolio in $ASTS.  So, Don't act on anything posted in here and proceed on your own risk...)

Roughly 40-47% of the world doesn't have access to online Porn or the internet, a **Trillion** dollar market untapped. Imagine more than **3 Billion** horny people limited to only masturbating to their imagination!!

ASTS is a potentially once in a decade investment, one to the likes of Tesla at it's beginnings... A service which has no competitors, not even StarLink(as per the CEO). The one investment which could offset all the previous losses...

ASTS is developing the **First and Only** Space based Cellular Broadband network, **SpaceMobile.** SpaceMobile will be **compatible** with all currently existing 5G and LTE smartphones without the need to do any modifications to your phones hardware. It will provide connectivity **at 4G/5G speeds** **everywhere on the planet – on land, at sea and in flight.** In addition, 5 Billion phones move in and out of coverage all the time, SpaceMobile is planning to bridge the gap of connection loss without the need of specialized equipment!

# The Technology (Too Technical and can be skipped):

**TLDR;  The tech has been proven to work on smaller scales but has yet to be done at the scale ASTS is aiming for. Additionally, it's 6G forward compatible!**

***OVERVIEW***:  AST &amp; Science (“ASTS”) has designed a large aperture satellite system to provide ‘direct-to-device’ service to normal phones using a low earth orbit satellite array to directly connect to mobile phones anywhere on Earth.

***Hardware***\*\*\*:\*\*\*   ASTS’ satellites are \~10x bigger than the norm because they are essentially cell-phone towers in space. With a [900-square meter array]( the system is a large **“loud”**  system that can connect with a regular mobile phone. Traditional satellite phones are just “listen hard” whereas ASTS simply produces a loud signal to connect to regular mobile phones.

***SOFTWARE:***   ASTS’ system does not require a special chipset on the phone because of its proprietary back-end software system that allows for interconnection to existing terrestrial(on Earth) spectrum and telecom networks. The “magic” of the technology is the back-end software that allows the system to utilize terrestrial spectrum, seamlessly interconnect over existing networks, and talk directly to an LTE system; ASTS is 6G forward compatible.

***BACKHAUL***:   Once the signal is collected from a handset, ASTS sends the data back  on B-Band satellite spectrum to a ground gateway system. The phone-satellite connection is native to the carrier’s terrestrial spectrum.

***CAPACITY***:  Each satellite can handle 1.2MM GB per month; extra capacity can be added by directing additional satellites at an area.

# Business Model(Can be skipped):

**TLDR; ASTS brings the satellites and execution while their partners bring the customers.**

***The Model:*** ASTS has chosen to partner with preexisting telecom giants to acquire a large customer base with essentially 0 acquisition costs per customer for ASTS. They have agreed to a 50/50 revenue split with its partners who are going to provide the customers. The 5g connection will be offered as an add-on to preexisting data plans provided by their partners or as a standalone purchase.

***How Does it generate Money? :***  With its current carrier partners, Vodafone and AT\&amp;T; given its large, fixed cost base, the Company expects to generate 90% asset-level EBITDA margins that provide  significant operating leverage and cash flow.

In-place there are binding agreements with carriers to provide ASTS with access to  &gt;1.3BN existing customers without having to independently market to or acquire customers (or directly bear the cost of churn). Phase 1 will  target key Equatorial regions and cover 1.6BN people. In subsequent phases, it's planning to expand into Europe and N. America by 2024.

The company is expected to generate &gt;$1bn of EBITDA by 2024 based on 168 satellites launched, 27MM total subscribers, with an ARPU of $2.50 per user.

***ASSets:***  ASTS has 750+ patents as well as a first-mover advantage(no competitors yet). Moreover, Commercial progress reinforces the Company’s technical lead in the market having ATT, Vodafone, American Towers and Rakuten in it's pocket.

# Timeline(can be skipped):

**TLDR;** **They have broken up their plan into 5 different phases spanning multiple  years with the intent of slowly expanding their satellite constellation until full global coverage is achieved.**

* Phase 1 - Equatorial constellation, 20 satellites by 2022
   * Cash flow from phase 1 will support the following phases
* Phase 2 - NA/Europe/Asia, 45 satellites by 2022
* Phase 3 - Full global coverage, 45 satellites by 2023
   * At this point ASTS expects to start turning a profit
* Phase 4 - Full global MIMO coverage (increased data capacity), 58 satellites by 2023
* Phase 5 - Scaling network globally, 16 satellites by 2028

# Management(Can be skipped):

* CEO Abel Avellan
   * 25+ years of space industry experience
   * Track record of building a successful global satellite communications company
      * EMC Emerging Markets Communications
* CFO Tom Severson
   * Former CFO of EMC
* CTO Huiwen Yao
   * 30+ years of experience in satcom
* CCO Chris Ivory
   * 25+ years of experience in satcom

Employees:

* 236 full-time employees
* 13 part-time employees
* 161 scientists and engineers
   * 24 of whom are PhDs

**The deep executive ranks include executives from Orbital ATK, Globecomm,  NASA, and Maxar • The team has 161 scientists and engineers, 34 of whom  are PhDs.**

# Catalysts(can be skipped):

**The most important catalyst is the BlueWalker 3 satellite launch which will be taking place sometime in Q4  2021.**

This will be a bigger satellite than any previous ones created but it still is not the biggest they plan to make. However, a successful launch and connection to BW3 would definitively prove that the tech works at larger scales.

Other smaller but still significant catalysts include:

* Government approvals for servicing in each country
* The launch date for BW3
* Acquisition of a portion of the federal 5g fund

# Risks(Can be skipped):

Every play ranging from 0dte to year long investments come with some amount of risk and this is no exception.  While some may simply be setbacks they are still worth knowing.

* Delays
   * Satellite construction and launch delays.
* Execution
   * Building, launching and deploying the satellites.
* Regulators
   * Need governmental approval for satellite operations from each country they wish to provide before they can service them.
* Tech
   * Satellite to phone connection still unproven on a large scale.
* Funding
   * Not fully funded (Need to raise \~1.5 bn) however phase 1 is fully funded and is planned to help pay for the subsequent phases.

# Valuation(Most important part):

The current market cap of ASTS is only 1.71 Billion for a stock with an extremely high potential, endless possibilities, and no competitors.

SpaceX's Starlink(If we want to compare apples to oranges), will provide **FIXED-POINT(Doesn't connect to mobile)** broadband to customers at very high costs with unclear quality. Moreover Starlink cannot translate to mobile devices. It depends on Dish Satellites.

StarLink is valuated between 40-50Billion Dollars! **Which equals around 222$-277$ of ASTS!!**

Just like Facebook found out after it's IPO, the real market is and always will be in **MOBILE** and Starlink cannot translate to mobile devices.

***Deutsche Bank most recent coverage:*** Their price target was set on 35$ and they added this nice comment **“If management executes on plan over the next five years, the company's intrinsic value should ultimately be ""significantly higher""** than the $35  price target.""

***Barclays Most recent coverage:*** Their price target was set on 29$.

**And Most importantly my coverage:** Well, you cannot really valuate this rare breed, because it's like trying to valuate $TSLA in the early days when it was just 50$(post split). ASTS is in a very similar situation right now having no competitors with a massive lead in the industry(A proven product on a small scale with well established partnerships with Vodafone, ATT, American Towers and Rakuten).

Right now, it should atleast have a market cap of 10 Billion, which is 1/4 Starlink, and there's actually no competition.

Price target will be illustrated with crayons bellow:

# The Premise

Credit spreads just require the underlying stock to be over or under a certain strike by the expiration date. This means that, for example, you can now bet on SPY being either over or under $450 by a certain date without worrying about how far over $450 or how far under $450 it actually goes. Or similarly you can also bet that say GME will finish this week either over or under $250. If the options expire worthless (sound familiar), you actually win! It's basically like betting on an over/under in sports.

# How it works

To open a credit spreads you simply sell a put/call and buy the put/call either below it (for puts) or above it (for calls). **YOU WIN IF BOTH OPTIONS EXPIRE WORTHLESS.** Since the put or call you sell is more expensive than the one you buy, you are collecting credit. This means that a **call credit spread is a bearish** position and a **put credit spread is a bullish position.**

# Example with visuals

I want to bet that SPY will be below $450 by EOW. To do this I sell the $450 call expiring on 8/27 and then buy the $451 call (the strike right above it).

The $450 call is worth $0.68 (which I get) and the $451 call is worth $0.38 (which I pay to buy). The difference between these values is 0.68 - 0.38 = 0.30 which I get to keep.

MAX PROFIT IF SPY FINISHES UNDER $450 AND BOTH OPTIONS EXPIRE WORTHLESS: $30 (0.30 x 100) for each contract.

MAX LOSS IF SPY FINISHES ABOVE $451: $1 (distance between the strikes) - $0.30 = $0.70 so $70 after multiplying by 100.

PROFIT LOSS GRAPH:

&amp;#x200B;



As you can see on the 27th if SPY finishes under $450 you make your max profit and if it finishes above $451 you trigger your max loss.

# RISKS

**Always close your spreads before market close even if it seems like both options will expire worthless. This is because if SPY closes at $449.5 (you think you make your max profit), but then decides to gap up in after hours to $450.5 the call you sold ($450) is now ITM but the call you bought to ensure you're not selling just a naked call ($451) is still OTM.** This opens you up to expiration/pin risk which can make your max loss larger than displayed above. This is not a problem if you simply close the spread before close and some brokers will automatically do this for you.

# You can even do 0dte challenges!

It's Friday and SPY is at $449 but you have a gut feeling that it won't go below $449 so you sell a 0dte $449 put and buy the $448 put. If by EOD SPY is above $449 then you win!

# TLDR:

You want to bet that SPY will be under $450 by EOW so you sell a $450 call and buy a $451 call. If SPY finishes under $450 you win and if it goes above you lose. You can do this with any ticker (betting that GME will finish above/under $250 or that AMC will finish above/under $50 by EOW).

Kicking rocks is cool as shit. anyways. This rock decided today it was time to fuck somebody's day up real hard. This little girl was crouching down, and I got to watch as the rock bounced and smacked this little girl right in the side of her head. I had fucked up.

I'm telling you this because among other lessons, I learned about ""timing"", and maybe looking at what's ahead of you before yeeting a jagged rock as hard as you can. that shit was traumatic, maybe a bit more for her than it was for me.

This may have been the same thing fellow low I.Q. apes like me have been feeling since jumping in on CLNE back in June. I had deposited my entire year's worth of Arby's Roast Beef Sandwich money, and I have since watched it reach a new low of $6.62 on August 19th.

So, hey idiot, you ask, why would I look at investing in CLNE after what you just said? well damn let me get straight on to it.

If you're reading this and you don't know about Clean Energy Fuels, you can follow the links below for further details on their fundamentals (from u/Tmoney127):

Here is a link to the DD which explains their deal with Amazon (from u/NrdRage):

[

What happened?:

It's February 2021. this old guy was just elected president, and he is a big fan of GREEN ENERGY. And so, the ""green wave"" begins. CLNE just so happens to be poised as the industry leader in putting RNG into trucks across America. On February 9, 2021 the stock reached a $19.79 high. a 670% growth in 3 months.

Why was everyone excited?:

Renewable Natural Gas (cow farts) is not fossil fuel, it captures harmful methane and turns it into usable gas. I won't get too far into detail, but let me just say RNG is a better play than EV or hydrogen, if we want to reduce carbon emissions in the SHORT TERM. RNG can be used for big rig transpo's NOW. not next year, and not 10-20 years down the road. We aren't ready for Hydrogen Fuel cell infrastructure. We don't need MegaChargers. Cow farts are running through our pipelines as we speak, and the room for exponential growth is quite wide.

Now you may have heard all this back in June, when a few popular DD's popped up here. The stock had reached a pull-back to $11, and it would have sounded great. You might have said to yourself, ""there's no way to lose here, this is going MOOOON"". cow, fart, rocket, moon.

let's take a look at the positions cost distribution for CLNE:

[If you have yet to invest into CLNE, there's hope. This is beyond thrift store sale prices. I want to be one of those guys in the green.](

Listen, I got C's in grade school. but I'm smart enough to learn from my mistakes like putting the peanut butter on the bread BEFORE putting it in the toaster might be a bad idea. If you're buying CLNE near it's new 2021 low, you're doing investing right.

Why invest now?:

CLNE just recently managed to reach a moving average crossover on it's daily chart, after 3 days of 5-8% gains (3 white soldiers, also bullish) the short-term moving average has surpassed the long-term moving average, which signals a bullish breakout pattern.

The UN released it's IPCC report, specifically mentioning the need to cut methane emissions.

[

Dems are about to pass a $3.5 trillion dollar infrastructure bill that specifically mentions carbon capture (i.e. capturing methane from cow poop), and green energy

On August 17th, CLNE signed new, and renewed, multi year contracts with cities across America, to provide millions of gallons of the precious cow fart fuel for its city vehicle fleets

Q2 earnings beat analyst estimates with a $0.01 EPS and actual revenue of $70.89 million

Bottom Line:

CLNE might be on a Bullish trend reversal. If you decide to wait and see what happens, that's fair, but don't get mad when you're left coughing up soot and NOx in your boomer diesel rig, while CLNE fuels our Cummins driven carbon negative chariots all the way to tendieland.",The Story of the Rock and the Cow Fart,126,13

Figs scrubs (FIGS) are making big changes to the technology, comfort, and design of medical scrubs. For decades nurses, doctors, dentists, physiotherapists, and other healthcare workers have struggled with boxy, saggy, uncomfortable clothing

FIGS created wrinkle-resistant, pre-shrunk, and odor-control material that is similar to Lululemon. They're fitted, comfortable, soft, and effective. Also, FIGS scrubs help nurses to deliver optimal patient care by reducing hospital-acquired infection through their 100% antimicrobial fabric. 

**Cult-Like Customer Base**

FIGS customers have returned for more purchases month after month. For customers that were acquired between 2017 and 2019, approximately 50% returned for a 2nd purchase, demonstrating high customer retention and engagement. After a 2nd purchase, 63% of those customers in that group bought *again*. After a 3rd purchase, 70% of those customers in that group **purchased yet again.** 

As of March 31, 2021, FIGS serves a community of approximately 1.5 million active customers, which compares to a broader total addressable market of over 20 million healthcare professionals in the United States. New data for Q2 2021 has not yet come out.

**Expansion on a Global Scale**

FIGS customers are mostly from the USA, but there is a huge opportunity over the long term to serve healthcare professionals throughout the rest of the world. The number of healthcare professionals and medical students worldwide is expected to grow from approximately 118 million in 2020 to an estimated 124 million in 2025, and the total addressable market for international healthcare apparel is expected to grow from an estimated $67.0 billion in 2020 to an estimated $86.0 billion in 2025.

&amp;#x200B;



**Not Just For Healthcare Professionals**

There is a huge opportunity to serve other uniform-wearing professional markets. In the United States, there are 40 million people who work in in service-based industries that traditionally wear uniforms every day (**I'm looking at you, Wendy's**). FIGS is working to be strategically positioned to expand into these new markets in the future. 

**Doing Some Good In The World**

The CEOs have made it their mission to do their part to give back to those in need on a massive scale. 

When a healthcare professional purchases FIGS, the company donates a pair to a healthcare worker in a resource-poor area (since not everyone can afford to buy their own scrubs). So far, FIGS has donated over 90,000 scrubs in 34 countries.

**Stonk Analysis**

Based on 10 Wall Street analysts offering 12 month price targets for FIGS in the last 3 months. The average price target is $44.10 with a high forecast of $53.00. The average price target represents a 23.25% change from the last price of $35.78.

FIGS reported their first quarter of earnings as a public company recently, and they beat on both the top and bottom line. They also offered strong full-year guidance, which represented 50% growth from the full-year of 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

[If this isn't a sign, I don't know what is. BTFD!](

While Figs increased their active customers by nearly 80%, they were also able to increase the average cart size (ARPU for you SaaS investors out there) by nearly 17% year over year. They also increased this sequentially. Management noted that this came from (and will continue to come from) their focus on lifestyle products, which I will get into shortly. Figs also reported $164.0 million of cash and cash equivalents, no outstanding borrowings. 

Despite the very strong quarter, there were a few hiccups in this quarter. First, they paid nearly $50 million in stock-based compensation in relation to the IPO. This is extremely high compensation, resulting in GAAP net losses for the quarter. Once new data comes out for Q3 2021, the real scene will start to play out.

&amp;#x200B;



They also spent a lot on sales and marketing this quarter. Sales expenses grew 49% YoY, and marketing expenses grew 76%. They used most of this to acquire new customers and transfer them to active customers, along with growing their brand awareness. While this hurts Figs in the short term, this spending could potentially result in long-term benefits for Figs. If they spend a lot on customer acquisition and increasing brand strength now, they could potentially end up spending less over the long term. Investors in Figs should watch these expenses closely. If these expenses continuously remain higher than revenue growth, it should be a cause for concern. However, if they start to slowly decline as time goes on, that would mean that this early spending is resulting in a diminished need for marketing spend.

The last potential reason for a fall, despite strong earnings, is simply that this company has risen rapidly since its IPO.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - FIGS is a huge disruptor to an industry that has been overlooked for decades. Healthcare, Wendy's employees, construction, military, police... they are providing comfortable, stylish, and high quality apparel to a customer base that loves them as much as Starbucks or Lululemon.

still tl;dr - FIGS  🚀🌕🚀🌕🚀🌕🚀

So this is just a very quick TA on UWMC and I'm gonna highlight the last 6 months graph.  Each time UWMC is heading into a earnings report it drops, each time it heads twords a dividend it rises.  I've highlighted those dates in the chart.  We just had a earnings that was mixed and the next dividend EX-date is 9/9 so a little over two weeks out.  If it does what it has been doing I expect a rise to at least low to mid $9's since right now the dividend is over 5% (0.10 per quarter per share).  The company is flush with cash, they have positive income, and the CEO is pretty pumped about the companies future.   The housing market is not going anywhere and unlike RKT a increase in interest rates will not affect UWMC much if at all.  See the many interviews CEO Mat Ishbia has given on the subject if you don't agree.

Most option strategies involve trading volatility in one way or another. It’s easy to think of trading in terms of direction. But trading volatility? Volatility is an abstract concept; it has often nothing to do with the stock price. I've seen many of you ask questions of the sort: 

Stock go up after earnings but call go down, hedgies bad. Or,

Stock go up, but put go up as well, I need to exploit this glitch.

I will try to shed some light on some of these topics. The first step to understand when buying options is that you profit from volatility going up.

Yes, you heard me correctly, you might not know it but when you buy FDs such as GME 1000C you are effectively long vega or long volatility. Yeah that's sounds fancy, I'm sure you'll impress your grandma with that at Christmas. She might even lend you some money so you can ""invest it"". 

Many traders trade without a solid understanding of volatility and its effect on option prices. These traders are often unhappily surprised when volatility moves against them. They mistake the adverse option price movements that result from volatility for getting ripped off by the market makers or some other market voodoo. 

The term volatility can have a few different meanings in the options business. There are three different uses of the word volatility that an option trader must be concerned with: historical volatility, implied volatility, and expected volatility. Let's dive in!

 

**Implied volatility** is the expected magnitude of a stock's future price changes, as *implied* by the stock's option prices. Implied volatility is represented as an annualized percentage. It's important to note that IV is extracted from the options price and is thus determined by supply and demiand

Consider the following stocks and their respective option prices (options with 37 days to expiration):

&amp;#x200B;



As we can see, both stocks are nearly the same price. However, the same options on each stock have different prices. In the case of TCOM, the call and put prices are much higher than ELY's options, which translates to an implied volatility that is higher than ELY So, instead of looking at option prices all day long, options traders use implied volatility to quickly compare the expected price movements (and therefore, the option prices) of various stocks. In this case, there's only a 10 percentage point difference between the two, yet the differences are huge.

**Why is this the case**

When market participants trade options, they typically do it for one of two reasons:

**1)** To speculate on movements in the stock price or the stock's option prices (implied volatility).

**2)** To hedge the risk of an existing position against changes in the stock price.

If market participants are willing to pay a high price for options, then that *implies* they are expecting significant movements in the stock price or implied volatility. 

Conversely, if market participants aren't willing to pay much for options, then that implies the market is not expecting significant stock price movements.

Since implied volatility represents the overall level of a stock's option prices, **implied volatility is just a way to describe the market's expectations for future stock price movements**. The higher the implied volatility, the larger the expected range of moves. This is why IV increases before earnings and crashes after.

Alright, this is the basics, now let's see some other concepts and dig deeper into IV.

&amp;#x200B;

**Historical Volatility** 

Imagine there are two stocks: Stock A and Stock B. Both are trading at around $100 a share. Over the past month, a typical end-of-day net change in the price of Stock A has been up or down $5 to $7. During that same period, a typical daily move in Stock B has been something more like up or down $1 or $2. Stock A has tended to move more than Stock B as a percentage of its price, without regard to direction. 

Therefore, Stock A is more volatile than Stock B. Thus, Stock A has a higher historical volatility than Stock B. Historical volatility (HV) is the annualized standard deviation of daily returns. Also called realized volatility, statistical volatility, or stock volatility.

HV is a measure of how volatile the price movement of a security has been during a certain period of time. But exactly how much higher is Stock A’s HV than Stock B’s? In order to objectively compare the volatilities of two stocks, historical volatility must be quantified. HV relates this volatility information in an objective numerical form. The volatility of a stock is expressed in terms of standard deviation. 

**Standard Deviation** 

Although knowing the mathematical formula behind standard deviation is not entirely necessary, understanding the concept is essential. Standard deviation, sometimes represented by the Greek letter sigma, is a mathematical calculation that measures the dispersion of data from a mean value. In this case, the mean is the average stock price over a certain period of time. The farther from the mean the dispersion of occurrences (data) was during the period, the greater the standard deviation. Occurrences, in this context, are usually the closing prices of the stock. For the purpose of illustrating standard deviation, a normal distribution is used here. When the graph of data adheres to a normal distribution, the result is a symmetrical bell-shaped curve. Standard deviation can be shown on the bell curve to either side of the mean. 

&amp;#x200B;



&amp;#x200B;

On the right vertical axis, you can see the number of occurences, on the horinzontal axis, you can see the daily return. The higher the curve, the more likely we are to see that return. For example, for stocks you are most likley to see returns around 0. This is why the curve is highest around 0.

Events that cause big changes in the price of a stock, like a company’s being acquired by another or discovering its chief financial officer cooking the books, are not a daily occurrence. Comparatively smaller price fluctuations that reflect less extreme changes in the value of the corporation are more typically seen day to day. Statistically, the most probable outcome for a price change is found around the midpoint of the curve. 

About 68 percent of all occurrences will take place between up one standard deviation and down one standard deviation. Two- and three-standard-deviation values could be shown on the curve as well. About 95 percent of data occur between up and down two standard deviations and about 99.7 percent between up and down three standard deviations. One standard deviation is the relevant figure in determining historical volatility. 

**Standard Deviation and Historical Volatility**

 When standard deviation is used in the context of historical volatility, it is annualized to state what the one-year volatility would be. Historical volatility is the annualized standard deviation of daily returns. This means that if a stock is trading at $100 a share and its historical volatility is 10 percent, then about 68 percent of the occurrences (closing prices) are expected to fall between $90 and $110 during a one-year period (based on recent past performance). Simply put, historical volatility shows how volatile a stock has been based on price movements that have occurred in the past. Although option traders may study HV to make informed decisions as to the value of options traded on a stock, it is not a direct function of option prices. For this, we must look to implied volatility. 

&amp;#x200B;

**IV rank and IV percentile**

Even though most of you degenerates first think about philosophy when you hear about the greeks, it's highly likely you've already heard of Implied Volatility Rank (IV Rank).  

If you've got one or two brain wrinkles you might even have heard about IV Percentile. We're going to highlight the difference between the two, which may help you lose less money in the future, or at least do it professionally

IV Rank is one of the more popular volatility trading metrics, and is relatively easy to understand.  IV Rank tells us whether implied volatility is high or low in a specific underlying relative to the past year of implied volatility data.

For example, imagine that implied volatility has ranged between 30 and 60 for underlying XYZ over the past year. If implied volatility is currently trading at 45, then the IV Rank for XYZ would be 50% - exactly in the middle of its one-year historical range.

If implied volatility was 60 in XYZ, then its IV Rank would be 100%. It literally is that simple:

IV of stock is low during the year, IV is high now -&gt; IV Rank will be high. 



&amp;#x200B;

Now let's take a look at Implied Volatility Percentile (IV Percentile).

Notably, IV Percentile doesn't specifically take into account the high and low in implied volatility over the past year.

Instead, IV Percentile represents the percentage of days that implied volatility has traded below the current level over the past year. For example, if IV Percentile is 5% in XYZ, that would mean that implied volatility only traded below current levels 5% of the time over the course of the previous 12 months.

On the other hand, if IV Percentile in XYZ is 80%, that would mean that implied volatility had traded below current levels 80% of the time over the previous 12 months.

The slide below, also from Trading with Katie, depicts graphically another example where IV Percentile is 21%. That means that 79% of the time, implied volatility was higher than current levels.



&amp;#x200B;

If you're interest I could go deeper and try to cover implied ranges or how to calulate what moves are expected in a stock given an IV. Send me a message, and I'll see what I can do.

In the mean time, please don't YOLO your mom's savings in some degenerate FD just because, ""I'm so cool, I'm long Vega"". I have little hope, but do send me a picture of your lambo when you make bank.

**TLDR: Volatility is important and easy to understand, go read. Big tendies await you**

Corsair gaming launched their first face cam under their Elgato brand. DDR 5 memory is coming soon. Shipping costs are going down. Crsr is paying off their debt. Revenues are growing every year and profits hitting records. Stock price has tumbled recently making this a good value/growth play. We all know the streaming industry and gaming industry is only going to continue to grow. Short percentage is the highest it’s ever been. I got in before wallstreet notices this stock. Some DD below.

In terms of revenue, Corsair Gaming saw a 24.3% growth to $472.9 million dollars with most of it coming from their gamer and creator peripherals sector. That revenue increased by a whopping 41% to $155.2 million dollars, while the gaming components and systems segment only increased by 17.6% to $317.7 million dollars. One reason behind that was the shortage of semiconductors which everyone knows about. However, more importantly for Corsair Gaming, there was a big shortage of high-end CPUs and graphics cards which really affected their ability to sell high-end gaming PCs. Corsair Gaming's CFO shared that they have a lot of customers waiting for these components to become available so we could see a bump in sales during the next quarter. Other flagship products were also affected and were out of stock for a long time. Keyboards. High-end headsets. Obviously, that also resulted in lower sales. Plus, historically, the second quarter of the year tends to be the weakest for Corsair Gaming in terms of revenue with the fourth typically being the strongest. You know, Black Friday, Christmas, it's a good quarter for a lot of hardware companies! Plus, Corsair Gaming maintain their focus on increasing their product range which will also continue to boost revenue.
Breaking down profits / earnings

Looking at profits, Corsair Gaming's gross margin remained flat at 27.6%. However, even though their gross profit increased by 24% as compared to last year, their operating profit dropped. One look at their financial statements tells us that their sales, general and admin expenses went up by a lot and essentially offset the jump in their profit. It looks like a big chunk, about $4.5 million dollars or 5%, was stock-based compensation, which is most likely the result of the jump in their share price or their revenue. A lot of companies have these stock incentives where they reward staff for good performance or their executives or CEOs for the jump in price. The good thing is that stock incentives are not actually cash expenses even though they are recorded on the income statement. Essentially, Corsair Gaming doesn't spend any cash on these. High stock incentives are typical for companies with recent IPOs or growing companies in general. When we compare Corsair Gaming's operating expenses to the same quarter last year, these increased by 41%. The main reasons behind that according to Corsair Gaming's CFO, Michael Potter, was increased shipping costs, more expenses due to Corsair Gaming now being a public company and also an increase in personnel costs due to growing their number of products. He expects that operating expenses will continue to rise as the company grows, but that should be offset by improving the gross margins. In terms of net earnings, their target net margins are in the low- to mid-teens so essentially between 10 and 15%. Currently, they are much lower. This quarter, the second quarter of 2021, their net margin is only 5.8%. Corsair Gaming's GAAP EPS was $0.28 dollars for the second quarter of 2021 and their non-GAAP EPS was $0.36. Corsair Gaming's net earnings were $27.7 million dollars, up from $22.6 million last year so a 22% increase! Their adjusted net earnings were $35.7 million, up from $32.3 million over the same period last year so again a 10.5% increase which is lower, but it's still good. Overall, net earnings are rising fast, but we can expect to see a lot of improvement over the next few quarters. One of the drivers behind higher margins is the increased demand for peripherals that we saw. As a segment, they are higher margin than the gaming components and systems segment with a gross margin of 35.2% vs 23.8% as of the second quarter of 2021. Growing the peripherals segment should result in better overall margins so it's good to see that there is increased demand.
Paying down debt

Before I move on to the outlook, I want to say that Corsair Gaming also managed to pay down some debt. Looking at the financial statements, we can see that their interest expense was only half of what it was last year! $4.5 million dollars in Q2 of 2021 vs $9.6 million dollars in Q2 of 2020! Corsair Gaming said that they're continuing to pay down the debt and expect only $4 million dollars worth of interest expenses for the coming quarters. Personally, I like the fact that they are keeping their finances under control. One of the main reason why fast-growing companies fail is due to aggressive overexpansion while having poor financial health. That's not going to happen with Corsair Gaming, which is really good to see.
2021 Guidance

Alright, so, the outlook! Corsair Gaming have said that their guidance for 2021 remains unchanged. They expect between $1.9 and $2.1 billion in revenue, adjusted operating income of $235 and $255 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $245 and $265 million. In 2020, Corsair Gaming's revenue was only $1.7 billion so that would show an increase of between 12% and 23.5% in revenue. Corsair Gaming's adjusted EBITDA was $213 million in 2020 so their guidance shows a possible increase of between 15% and 24.5%, which is great to see! Personally, I also want to see this reflected in their net income, but as I said, I think stock compensation and a couple of other factors can affect this. In terms of things to watch, it looks like the semiconductor shortage and shipping costs are at the top of the list. The sooner these issues go away, the sooner Corsair Gaming will see a jump in net income.",CRSR going to the moon soon? Buckle up apes! 🧨🚀🚀🚀,455,7

Every method of valuation has its pros and cons. For example, the price to earnings ratio can only be used on profitable companies and the price to book ratio is quite terrible with companies that are heavy on intangible assets. I’ve already done write ups on these two ratios for anyone new to these. 

So, none of them are perfect, but one of them can come quite close – with a little bit of help. I’m going to explain what price to sales is, why it works, how to use it, and then I’m going to make a modification to increase its effectiveness.

#**What is P/S?**
The price to sales ratio is calculated by dividing the company’s total market cap by it’s total revenue. Why it’s called price to sales and not price to revenue, who knows, but revenue is simply the number of sales times the number of units sold so the name isn’t too far off. 

What is this ratio actually saying? It’s a way of normalizing the relationship between the market cap and the revenue. Let’s say a company’s market cap is $100 and that their revenue was $25. Dividing 100 by 25 results in a price to sales of four. This means that this company earns 1/4th of its total value each year. This number on its own doesn’t really mean anything, but it’s a way to compare companies to each other. Let’s say we have a second business that has a market cap of $300 and a revenue of $100 which results in a price to sales of three. When market caps and revenues are in the billions it can be hard to tell which one makes proportionally more money. When you normalize them like this you can see that the second company makes 1/3rd of its value each year vs the 1/4th from the first example. 

Knowing this, it makes sense to buy companies with lower price to earnings ratios because a lower ratios means you’re making proportionally more money for your size.

#**Real application**
Most fundamental ratios are aimed at finding good value stocks that may be underpriced, however not everyone is looking for traditional value stocks. Price to sales is one of the few ways to value growth stocks as well as stocks that are not yet profitable. These types of companies often have low or negative earnings. This is likely because they are either just starting to grow, or because they are reinvesting everything back into the company to attempt to grow faster. If you were using price to earnings these would appear to have incredibly high or non-existent ratios and would be quickly ignored by most people. Price to sales still very much applies to value stocks, I simply wanted to show that it’s not exclusive to them like many other ratios are.

So now you know how to calculate it and that it can be used on almost anything, but how do you actually use it. If you’ve read my other write ups or watched any of my videos you’ll become very familiar with this answer – you use it to compare similar companies in similar industries. The reason for this is because you want to minimize external factors that could shift the results one way or another. Price to sales is often considered to be a judge of popularity because some sectors will have higher ratios simply because they are more popular industries. Innovative new companies working on artificial intelligence or green energy will likely have higher ratios than tobacco or oil companies even if their financial statistics and growth expectations were the same. This is simply because people *like* those companies more.

#**The good and the bad of using sales**
Let’s dive into the positives of using sales or revenue as a metric. The revenue a company earns is a pretty straightforward number. There are fewer precursory steps to reach it than something like earnings or book value, both of which can be manipulated by different business and accounting practices. This means that it’s generally more reliable than anything that is derived later down the line. As I mentioned before, it can be applied to a wider array of companies because basically every company has a revenue. It also does not get influenced by the ratio of tangible or intangible assets like book value can. This makes it sound far superior to both anything that uses earnings or book value, but it does have some pitfalls. 

I had two example companies above, one company worth $100 and earning $25 and one company worth $300 and earning $100. We determined that the second one, which has a P/S of three, was better. What if the first company only had $10 in expenditures while the second company had $75? The $100 company would take home $15 in profit and the $300 company would only take home $25 despite being three times larger. When you multiply P/S by the profit margin you arrive back at P/E. The lesson here is that revenue doesn’t mean as much when you don’t know the profit margins. If you don’t want to be tricked by this, either compare companies that have similar profit margins, or make sure both P/S and P/E agree on which company is better. 

The next pitfall on our list is the issue of cash and debt. A company with more debt has more leverage. They can spend additional money which allows them to generate additional returns. A company with no debt might have $10 to spend which might yield $20 in revenue. A company with x2 leverage has $20 to spend which might yield $40 in revenue. This boosts their revenue but it’s because they were taking on more risk, not because they actually performed better. Thankfully this also has a pretty nice fix. Let’s make up yet another hypothetical company. Company C has a market cap of $500, a revenue of $100, this would give it a P/S of 5. It also has $25 in cash, and $125 in debt. This company has a good chunk of debt which gives them some additional leverage. To make this more normalized we can convert their market cap, the P in our P/S equation, to EV which stands for enterprise value. EV is calculated by taking the market cap and adding the debt and then subtracting the cash. So, for Company C that comes out to be 500 + 125 – 25 = 600. You can now use this to get their EV/S, which is six. This is higher than the five they had before because we took away their leverage. Now all companies can be compared on a more even footing. 

#**Conclusion**
Price to sales, or as we will now call it, EV/S, is generally considered to be the most effective fundamental ratio out there. Now, just because it is the best doesn’t mean you should use it alone. You should always use fundamental ratios as only one of many available tools. 
Now that the disclaimer is out of the way, let’s see how it does stack up even on its own so that we can give it a fair comparison to other ratios and ideas. Buying stocks with a low P/S ratio outperformed broad market indices 95% of the time during any 10 year period from 1953-2003. During this same period the lowest P/S stocks outperformed the highest P/S stocks by a factor of over 1,000. The stocks with the lowest P/S ratios had an average return of 17.46% and the stocks with the highest had an average return of 3.12%. Whether this will continue to work in the future is, as always, not guaranteed.
If you want to make use of this tool for yourself, use EV/S and make sure you look at profit margins. Between these two points you’ll have accounted for the two pitfalls discussed. Use it on similar industries and use it as part of a set. Thank you for reading. 

#**TLDR**
Price to sales can be misleading on its own, but you can mostly fix this by accounting for differing levels of cash and debt as well as by checking profit margins. This new ratio, after the adjustment, is called EV/S and it is the most effective fundamental ratio, at least on its own. It can be used on value stocks, growth stocks, and even unprofitable companies. Use it, along with other tools, to compare similar companies to find which one is most likely underpriced.

Why I have loaded up on Rocket Lab:

1. Low market valuation relative to peers (i.e SpaceX is already at lofty valuation, leaving less room for price growth, believe around $90 billion). Virgin galactic was trading at almost 2x the market cap, $10 billion, for a while with a lot less to show for it, and countless delays. Astra is trading about half the market cap of rocket lab (without even delivering 1 customer payload to orbit yet?).

2. Proven ability to get to orbit. 20+ successful launches, with 100+ satellites in orbit.

3. Small rockets aren’t as bad of a limitation as you’d think initially, actually provides greater flexibility with launch dates, and more granular orbit positions for customer satellites (and I’ve read that 98% of satellites would be able to fit on electron, but I need to find the link that references this).

4. Plans to use raised capital to fund larger ‘Neutron’ rocket, being built for human space flight, and to further compete with SpaceX as an orbital launch provider for satellite constellations.

&amp;#x200B;



According to the above linked FINRA enforcement, JP Morgan, the largest bank in the US, from 2009 until at the very minimum late 2015, violated regulation SHO rule 204 by incorrectly allocating (ie: NOT allocating...) securities that have failed to deliver to the brokers in which they fund.

The way my smooth brain understands it, JP Morgan is a 'prime broker', meaning basically a broker for brokers. For example, Shitadel would have a margin account with a prime broker. If they were to be margin called, it would be their prime broker doing the calling.

I'll use an example to illustrate my understanding:

Broker A shorts 100 shares of CompanyA, and does not buy to cover.

\- Broker A owes prime broker 100 shares lent on margin.

... some days pass ...

\- Prime broker notices that Broker A has not delivered 100 shares of CompanyA to cover, and that by law this must be reported to the SEC per Reg SHO as FTD. The FTD at this point is owned by the Prime broker and it is their responsibility to ensure that the security is actually purchased because theft is a crime and all. They force Broker A per regulatory cadence to purchase the share and deliver it.

In JP Morgan's case, they were not sufficiently allocating the failed to deliver shares to the brokerages, and were doing so in a way that the brokers could plausibly deny 'knowing that they had the FTDs'...

Why I think this is a HUGE FUCKING DEAL:

to my understanding, ALL FTDs for ALL securities that failed to deliver \*\*and were NOT purchased to cover by their sub brokers\*\* over the course of SIX years now rests as JP Morgan's responsibility.

there is no number given, only 'OVER xx amount per month' and 'OVER 100,000' for the duration. FINRA gives two broker examples, A and B, but JPM obviously didn't know what the fuck they were doing and I don't see how this would have been limited to just A and B...

All of these failed positions that were never covered and were never put in the penalty box like they should have been. Assuming they are still outstanding, **WOULD NOW BE IN THE PENALTY BOX, UNTIL EVERY LAST FAIL HAS BEEN PURCHASED.**

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

(more)Speculation incoming:

around 1:00 today, nearly every single ticker that has been notoriously high in their FTD rate began to moon.

I wonder if JPM is beginning to close some of these positions after this ruling was posted... I'm sure they will get what they can from whoever owes it to them, but they will be on the hook for the rest, and they cannot lend/sell short any ticker with an outstanding fail to deliver.

**I cannot imagine the number they are looking at if the reality is as bad as it looks - i'm counting on your collective wrinkles to help sort this out.**

TLDR:

They send excel sheet of fails to broker, broker thinks its notice of 'potential buy in', broker continues to buy/sell the failed security and never questioned about it again.

for six years.

&amp;#x200B;



There are alot of implications here, like - is the penalty box full as of, today?  JPM covering all of these?  JPM margin calling their broker-dealers like monday that didn't deliver and were ignorant to having to \*\*cover their shorts\*\*?

\- SOFIs Price to sales ratio is roughly a third of HOOD and UPST and roughly 40% less than AFRM. Price to Sales ratio to me is a key metric in evaluating newly public, fast growing companies that do not yet report a profit. The same trend is consistent when looking at forward price to sales ratio

\- SOFI posted the strongest Q over Q member growth out of the group. Given the diversification in product offering this is key since SOFI a wider variety of cross-sell revenue generating opportunities

\- SOFI is closer to profitability compared to Robinhood and Affirm based on EPS T12M, but Upstart is already posting a profit. Note: the latest SOFI earnings report contained a one time loss due to their acquisition of Galileo which will not be included on future earnings reports

\- Upstart had MASSIVE Q over Q revenue growth which justifies the very high price to sales ratio of 40.45

As of recently its starting to break out of this range soon, and if yall ever seen what happens to a range bound stock thats been consolidating for months look at amd, apple, amazon , netflix etc. It gets extremely nasty for bears. 

Tesla has been looking bullish recently and has had a lot of good news coming its way , so first off q2 earnings. 

tesla used to make a shit ton of cash from its ev tax credits , it still did but it wasnt as much of its revenue . which is a good thing

next , tesla beat rev expectations coming in with 11.96 billion dollars with a net income of over 1 billion dollars for the first fucking time guys! This is huge because well you see, it pulled this off while facing supply issues and supply chain issues are usually problems that are fixed relatively quick ( depends how fast we get covid more under control)  so imagine what it can do when supply chain issues are fixed . Also just so yall know last year q2 tesla had a net of 100mil soo it 10xed it .

Its has 3 mega factories now , germany , china and the usa and when they are at full capacity they will be able to create an estimated 1 million teslas each which means atleast 3 million teslas per year allowing tesla to keep up with its demands and also possibly lower its prices due to volume . **Now this is important pay attention.**

**Tesla has a self driving subscription for about 100 a month.** Basically people can opt into a monthly sub and have self driving feature . This is amazing because a it makes tesla even more money on top of its car sales but b the data that tesla gets from the fsd will help improve its self driving and make it even better than before.

 Now imagine the factories at full capacity , 3 million cars each year say 90% of them are sold so thats like 2.7 million now from a conservative stand lets say of those 2.7 mil only 6% get the sub for a year that means 162k people have the sub. They pay 100 a month soo basically 1 year tesla raked in about 194 million off of that alone and they would be able to collect more data about driving from 160k more new people . AND this isnt even including the people who previously bought a tesla and have a fsd subscription that they will probably have for the following years aswell.

Now one last thing , tesla doesnt only make cars . They also work on being very efficient with energy storage and use.  Tesla has a solar energy sector that makes millions, tesla has its own insurance , and most importantly tesla is testing out and refining energy storage. Remember that tesla factory battery fire in Kangaroo land? Well that caused the stock to soar because it remined investors that holy fuck tesla isnt only a car manufacturer , its a fucking tech company . 

Either way tesla is about ready to make its climb from 700 back to 900s its just a matter of when.

inb4 anybody looks down their nose at me through their fkn nerd glasses this is wallstreetBETS, not r/investing. 

First of all I sure as hell don't understand technical analysis so fuck your charts and logic, nor do I understand what the fundamentals of a business even are. What tf is an EBITDA anyway? 

What I technically understand is that fundamentally nearly every single fucking retard I know smokes weed. Obviously people are buying this shit. Low wage workers are not the only people smoking weed, I know biologists and chemists of varying backgrounds who are tokin' on the reg. Messing around with the devils lettuce will pass cigarettes, vaping, and drinking the crazies in popularity among the younger generations in NA. Vaping is trashy, cigarettes are gross and drinking causes hangovers. 

Maybe some of you roll your eyes at this, but I do think you're underestimating the near-term upside potential of the weed industry in general. Obviously some of this has to do with the US government (no politic) and I'll do my best to convince you why some regulation is coming and soon. Regulation is the biggest barrier for this industry to hurdle but there are other reasons to be optimistic; high demand, medical benies, drinks, market consolidation, cbd, growing revenues, operational efficiency. 

I basically have three reasons for believing the marijuana industry is about to go to the moon that all boil down to basically the only thing holding back this industry: fkn big gov regulation.

&amp;#x200B;

**Evolving Industry:**

This industry is evolving by making lots of different products sure, but even more so in that there are fewer and fewer mom and pops. Getting some kind of product out the door was easy enough, grow pot -&gt; sell pot, but there's now guys in lab coats doing some [crazy magic]( 

Another thing to note within this industry is that there have been many acquisitions or mergers; currently that's slowing down, but regulation will help speed this up across the US as many states have already legalized pot on some level. There is a lot more to come and I'm sure that bigger players who could become a swift force in the industry will time their entry.

States across the US and companies in Canada are realizing that we can produce more pot than we will ever smoke and they've gone through/are still going through the growing pains from this. The US has a more significant problem in that cannabis growers can only sell to retailers within their state. Canada is currently figuring out the best way to handle production. When growers are able to do interstate commerce there will be over supply, but what follows is consolidation and operational efficiency. 

The sheer amount of different marijuana products being created is ridiculous, but there some that I think could change the industry. Something that can be mass produced like pills, drinks or marijuana cigarettes.

**Popularity/demand:**

There are supposedly a whole lot of medicinal benefits to weed; whether or not they are for yuppies is up to you, but they buy it. And there are some real notable medical applications in some neurological disorders. The point is that they make this shit into a million different kind of products. There's raw pot, joints, edibles, drinks, oils, topicals, cosmetics, and they all have different flavors and variations. The drinks are probably the most important product for this industry. How easy was it to give this stupid hard seltzer fad a try? Dirty bongs, pipes, baggies o' ganja and blow torches understandably produce aversion in people, but a can stored in a cooler/fridge has a lot of appeal.  

Aside from the potential of something like a canned drink becoming fashionable the [popularity]( of the old dirty stuff is [sizable]( These days in my conservative state where marijuana is illegal the common conversation around marijuana goes a few different ways; at best, its open support for legalization and at worst, its something like, ""I don't think they should go to jail for it."" 

The market projections upon legalization are [huge]( This alone ought to convince most autists that there is a rocket ship loading up. 

**Regulation:**

I think that rocket ship is going to being taking off soon. I don't want to get too far into the politics of this, but I can say that the stars might just align. Appetite for regulation is highest on the Blue team, but that isn't to say that there is no appetite on the Red team. The blues have control of the government and the [head blue himself gathered some of the other top blues and introduced a discussion draft and plan to end discussion on Sep 1]( That's pretty soon, js. 

Most of you are probably shaking your heads and thinking that politicians promise all kinds of things and you're right. I'll just say that I'm a bit of a political nerd, I was an intern on the hill and I listen and read lots of news. I only say this, because the following explanation of my analysis is probably going to be incoherent. So, many politicians, especially the ones you most often see on TV promise all kinds of things, but Senate Majority Leaders literally set the agenda for the senate. They cannot overpromise, because they actually have the power to do something. Average lawmakers can always overpromise, because when they don't achieve their goals they have reasonable excuses. Obviously even majority leaders with the full support of the rest of the government can fail; for example, when McCain voted  to prevent McConnell from passing ACA repeal. [Marijuana regulation has passed in democratic house in the past]( So the senate and the presidency are where the action is happening. The president has expressed willingness to sign decriminalization regulation. His language during the debates and in his campaign platform pointed to decriminalization and restorative justice. This is a small issue for him, but given its widespread popularity and campaign promises it is an easy political win for him to sign. Vetoing and refusing to sign in the case that this did pass would severely damage the Blues just before a midterm. The senate is going to begin debating reform soon, according to the leader of the senate. 51 liberal votes and 50 conservative votes. Although a couple liberals in the senate have voiced opposition to national recreational legalization, no one has opposed decriminalization, which is likely where debate will end up. But you need 60 votes anyway, so let's talk about the Reds. Several conservative states have legalized marijuana recreationally and even more medically, so the politics for them is complicated and not all of those will support legislative efforts. Decriminalization is an easy 'states rights' conservative appeal. Some states will likely keep marijuana criminalized. The Reds support is the most sensitive. The story with conservative support is that you have some libertarian leaning, young, ambitious senators on the red team. The young and/or ambitious senators (think Josh Hawley, Rand Paul, or even Cruz), especially on the red team, will potentially see an opportunity to take the side of a popular issue among young voters (a demographic they would like to make competitive in roads with). The red's opposition is a hardline as long as we talk about ""legalization,"" but as the debate continues we will begin to talk about ""decriminalization,"" which would allow states to determine criminality and also open barriers for the marijuana industry to thrive. The biggest obstecle for the reds is really the restorative justice efforts, reds are usually of the mindset that those people in jail still deliberately broke the rules. The debate will be messy, but this betting man says that we'll land on either decriminalization or interstate commerce regulation. Either way we're going to tendie town bby. 

It is absolutely notable that one of America's largest employers, Amazon(has a mansion in DC for smoozing), supports federal regulation.

All in all, the near-term potential hinges on federal regulation (which I bet is coming through soon), but we all know that long-term its a win.",Bullish on Weed,53,2

First let us first examine our faithful slut SPY. Reaching returns of over 100% since March lows, it is time for this baby to start a correction. Looking like ""sell in September"" is going to be a real thing for all the boomers real soon. Looking at the chart below, it is only a matter of time before SPY decides to dump its pants. I'm not saying a recession type of drop, but at least a small correction. My target would be the blue zone marked below, but I would expect at least a retest of 400 at some point.

&amp;#x200B;



Now on to our memes. BB (Blackberry for all you newbs), has been patiently consolidating, waiting for an outflow from boomer equities back into the memes. If you have been paying attention the past few months, you notice that any time the market starts to fall, the memes start to pop a little. It's almost like people are treating the meme stocks as safety for their cash because they have been pretty consistent with basically having a negative Beta.



If you look at the chart below, this is the weekly chart showing the first and second meme pumps casually lifting off the long term trendline marked. The selling has dried up, and volume managed to enter at the right time to maintain our trend. Now if this holds and BB manages to break above our recent high ($28.77), $40 per share could be possible given that the current market situation develops as I imagine it will, with SPY falling at the same time the memes are catching significant inflow.

[Cyber Security Competitors \(BlackBerry VERY undervalued\)](

**Facebook Patent Settlement/Partnership Catalyst**

Blackberry filed a lawsuit against Facebook for Patent Infringement (and won). Technology in WhatsApp Messenger apparently is Blackberry's tech and Facebook wasn't paying any licensing fees to Blackberry. Both parties settled out of court, Blackberry got a positive judgement against Facebook and a judge in Germany ordered a halt on WhatsApp use of BB technology which could have affected nearly 80 million users.

Only the patent settlement Facebook and Blackberry reached out of court recently turned into a patent sale. With a large upfront payment and 7 years of IP licensing tail.

John Chen CEO said in March that BB entered into patent sale negotiation with North America based tech company and can't disclose more.

I strongly believe that BB and FB are negotiating not just patent sale but also a partnership agreement. Blackberry will secure WhatsApp Messenger for Enterprise. (This might be huge as Salesforce bought Slack). Blackberry also gets free advertising on FB Instagram.

Patent payout upfront 600 million plus 1.4 billion over seven years in IP licensing.

Facebook wants to get in on the action and partner with Blackberry. After all it's Blackberry who invented the smart phone and the instant messenger. Judges, lawyers and political figures were using Secure Messenger BBM well before anyone else. They were first to market in smart phones and BBM

Mark Zuckerberg was living in the college dorm even Blackberry enterprise customers were already using BBM and it's only fair that Blackberry finally gets fair compensation for their innovative technology.

John Chen when asked about the patent sale he said stay tuned. He meant there is very good news coming soon. Don't sell your shares.

**IVY Connected Car (IoT Internet of Things) + Amazon Partnership**

As we all know AWS has entered a multi-year, global agreement with BlackBerry (BB) QNX to develop BB IVY.

Ivy benefits the whole value-chain

* IVY enables automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences by allowing for a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights. AKA feed OEMs MORE DATA that is actionable.
* The developers won’t need specialized or automotive software skills.

Modern cars and trucks are built with thousands of parts from many different suppliers, with each vehicle model comprising a unique set of proprietary hardware and software components. These components, which include an increasing variety of vehicle sensors, produce data in unique and specialized formats. The highly specific skills required to interact with this data. With BB IVY there is no need to worry about special automotive programming languages, hardware variations, or proprietary sensor data formats.

* The consumer (driver) gets more frequent feature updates allowing for better performance/experience along with safety of their data

Data is the new Gold/Oil

BB has had a vision to build a data analytics platform for years which they showcased at CES 2 years ago.

In a Bloomberg interview, John Chen says the following in regards to BB Ivy “By the way this project, we’ve been working with Amazon has taken us probably about 2 years - we started this whole program 2 years ago at CES. We demonstrated a little piece of technology at that time, obviously not as elaborative as today..”.

He goes on to say that this creates a recurring data business for BB. This point should not be overlooked! As a Mckinsey &amp; Co report  ([ connected cars (the new iPhone) will allow for the OEMs to monetize data from connected cars. We all know that 7/10 most valuable companies in the world generate billions in profits from data-based services.

Chen explains that Amazon is interested in BB for 2 reasons:

1. QNX provides Amazon with a secure, safety certified OS (aka the “plumbing” or ecosystem Ivy will be built on)
2. BB secures all endpoints in the Internet of Things

Let’s not make this complicated.

1. $AMZN has been consolidating since its past earnings disappointment and has found solid support at the $3200 level. At $3300, it’s the time to at least initiate a position if you don’t have one already.
2. $AMZN currently sits at an IV rank of 1%. That means over the past year the IV has been higher 99% of the time. What makes IV swell? Earnings. What happens when IV swells? The price of the underlying option goes up.
3. The S&amp;P 500 is up 19.26% YTD, 30.66% over the past 365 days. $AMZN is essentially flat in both regards and is the worst-performing FAANG name on a yearly basis. Comparatively, FAANG names like $GOOG and $MSFT have far outperformed the S&amp;P. \[1\]
4. $AMZN is breaking out of a descending wedge with large gaps to fill in the 3400-3600 range. \[2\] I know a lot of you believe TA is voodoo, but there are people with a lot of money who trade according to fun shapes on a chart, and their trades move price action just as much as anyone else’s. Whether it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy or a crystal ball, we have to pay some attention when the Technical Analysis people start crowing en masse, and that’s what’s happening here.
5. Antitrust is not a headwind here. One, because the likelihood of any significant antitrust legislation getting by the powerful lobbying force of $AMZN is nil. And two, because if split, $AMZN (and $GOOG)’s businesses would likely each command higher valuations. And on that note:
6. Barron’s on $AMZN: “Valuing AWS at 15x 2023 sales gives you a market cap of $1.5T, meaning that investors are getting Amazon’s e-commerce business and its nascent advertising business almost for free.” \[3\] Barron’s isn’t the only publication to recently recognize this, but I hesitate to link to anything Motley has done because I have more self-respect than that.
7. Out of 64 analysts who have covered $AMZN in the past year, all 64 rank the stock as a buy. \[4\]
8. CEO Andy Jassy lowered upcoming ER expectations considerably in the past ER, which is what caused the sell-off. For those of you who don’t know, doubt is a good thing. Lowered expectations are a good thing. Because the bar for $AMZN’s October quarter has been lowered tremendously, it’ll be that much easier to achieve a strong beat, and a positive surprise.
9. Amazon-backed Rivian's EV is set to roll out in September, one month before the ER hype begins to build. It isn't the biggest deal in the world, but it's going to give analysts some more fuel to write positive articles about $AMZN's future growth opportunities and maybe bump up a few price targets, all of which are sitting well above $AMZN's current price.
10. I put this at the end because it is the most speculative point, but the possibility of a split still looms. If they announce a split, forget all this, sell your house, and all-in your life savings, because that would change the game. Not only because $AMZN is literally (on a price basis, not a valuation basis) an expensive stock with even more expensive options (Which Jassy currently owns many, many of), but because it would almost inevitably lead to $AMZN’s Dow inclusion, a forced buying event similar in nature to $TSLA’s SPY inclusion. Tl;dr: It’d be in both the shareholder's and Jassy’s best interest (if he ever wants to be able to sell any of those options, that is) to split the stock.

Summary: It’s oversold, many HF’s bought in last quarter at a much higher price, Jassy gave himself a low bar for their first quarter under new management (Common among new CEOs), and the IV is at a one year low. Buy November calls near the money for a bounce, or just to hold. Grab some here, double down if we dip to $3200, and at every $100 dip to follow. Those of you who remember me from my last account know that I put my money where my DD is, and this post is no different. I have 53k riding on this trade and plan to add more if given the opportunity.

OPEN recently reported a great Q2, beating estimates with revenue of $1.2B and a net loss of $143M. Q3 projected revenue from the company is $1.8-1.9B and unless I’m not understanding something correctly, I think they are about to post a $3B+ quarter in Q3.

Background: I used to spend 20-30 minutes a day looking through OPEN’s website and calculating the number of homes listed/sold. Was lucky to stumble upon ibuyerstats.com and I’ve found it to be fully reliable, saving me lots of time and it has some helpful analysis. 

Calculation: according to ibuyerstats.com, OPEN has listed 4,989 homes since July 1st. The total number of homes listed on OPEN (only homes that are OPEN owned, not just homes people list themselves) has increased by 503 since July 1st. So a simple calculation tells you that OPEN has sold ~ 4,500 homes so far this quarter. At an average selling price of $400k, OPEN has pulled in revenues of $1.8B in just 53 days (already what they were projecting for the entire quarter).

53 days is 58% of the days in a quarter, and when you add in the other 42% you get revenues of $3.1B, however this doesn’t include revenues from their listing platform and a general increase in sales that is likely to continue through the remainder of Q3. 

I’m completely open to any criticism as I’m genuinely curious if any of you think this simple calculation is a fair representation of the quarter OPEN is about to deliver.

&amp;#x200B;

While it might be desirable to live a life of a maverick that feeds upon unpredictability by being a non-conforming individual. 

&amp;#x200B;

Between our craves and our regrets stands the live stage of the presence that must give meaning and consistency and feel-good vibes to our life. At the same time, it raises the power of positivity and reconciles the history of our past with the expectations of the future.

&amp;#x200B;

A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency, a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words, and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day. — 'Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.' — Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and RobNum1 and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood.”

&amp;#x200B;

To be consistent means to be reliable, repeatable, and predictable.

  

Consistency is the result of having the discipline to keep focus in the pursuit of success.  One quality of the most successful people is their laser focus.  To ""Keep your eye on the prize"" so to speak.  Those that possess this quality have a better chance to achieve their goals. Robnum1 is one individual that does not possess such quality.

&amp;#x200B;

October 15th, May 18th, August 24th, September 5th, December 20th. Dates which will live in infamy. We heard his warnings of the apocalyptic collapse of the stock market but did not re-joyce. His misguided warnings some say puts him in the same room with gold bug Peter Schiff or the popular financial blog ""ZeroHedge"" where the sky is falling on a daily basis since 2007.

&amp;#x200B;

While we did not expect him bring the walls of street to come crashing down like our former /r/wallstretbets moderator /u/pokimanelol caused in March of 2020, after all those are some big shoes to fill.  Robnum1 could not even fill the 1 of the size 5 womans shoes of /u/pokimanelol with both feet.

&amp;#x200B;

His prophecy of financial armageddon was because he dreamed big and had such high hopes but fell short and gave us small dreams and low ropes.  RobNum1 is by far the most consistent individual that has ever graced wsb discord.

That Wendy’s was completely remodeled inside and out. I searched to see if it was a publicly traded company and it is (WEN), trading around $23.80 when I looked it up the first time. McDonald’s was somewhere above $235 at that time (mid August 2021) which made me wonder if there was a lot of unappreciated value in Wendy’s.

I just returned from a 5 or 6 day road trip on August 23, 2021 which spanned from So Cal to Arizona, New Mexico and El Paso, with lots of stops in between. There’s lots of Wendy’s and they are all being remodeled in the trendy brushed chrome and straight lines style that is common now and they are from what I've seen excellently located and there’s lots of them.

Here’s some numbers from recent news about WEN:

Investors of record on Wednesday, September 1st will be given a dividend of $0.12 per share up from $0.10

Wendy's also announced a $10 million incremental investment in breakfast advertising in 2021, taking the total expected investment to $25 million for the year.

Wendy's also said restaurant services provider Reef Kitchens would open and run 700 delivery kitchens, over the next five years. Wendy's said it expects to open about 50 delivery kitchens in 2021, with the remainder launched by 2025.

Analysts from Oppenheimer, Wedbush, Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Northcoast Research and Argus all have price targets from between $25 to $30

Wendy's insiders own about US$417m worth of shares 

Upcoming Q3 Earnings Call November 10, 2021 

Expected EPS $0.18          Expected Revenue $471.78M

Previous    EPS               Revenue

Q2 2021   Beat 51.24%  Beat 6.64%

Q1 2021   Beat 36.88%  Beat 3.35%

I opened a position in WEN at about $23.75 a share. I like the company and where it’s going. I figured if the stock market closed for a year I wouldn’t mind owning the stock. Don’t be too hard on me I can hardly read a page in a book without going over a sentence 2 or 3 times so my DD is not the best!",first time DD research on Wendy's Restaurants (WEN),4,7

Alright fellow degenerates, I giveth you my second offering of the “Kunt’s brilliant retarded plays”.  If you would like to see the first edition see here, but remember past performance isn’t indicative of blah blah blah you stopped reading already:


DD:  Palantir is WSB red headed step child.  You loved him when you first got him but you realized you actually had to deal with him, feed him, and care about him; and so you let him sleep under the stairs like a mud blood.  I get it… he buys gold and puts on sunscreen; a true day walker.

Here is something you dipshits need to understand, military fiscal years end in September and the way most military branches work is they have to SPEND money that they have before September or they don’t get it again the next year.  To quote the 40 year old virgin “if you don’t use it your lose it”.  US tax paying dollars at work.  Sometimes that money can be extended until December but it will be spent in 2021 and almost always on the biggest alligator closest to the boat.  You know who is going to get a big part of that money?  

Palantir.  Why?  It just turns out that there is a certain country that the US used to do an incredible amount of intelligence gathering on who’s government was just returned to a certain military group and is seen as an enemy to the US.

Below is a fairly in-depth due diligence on Lucid Motors, also known as Lucid Group, Inc and now trading on the NYSE as $LCID. I've been disappointed by most of the low-effort DDs posted so far and feel we need something more complete. I've made an attempt to be as neutral as possible but as a disclaimer I am long-term bullish (position discussion at the end). I've tried to be as neutral as possible with corresponding resources easily available so you can make your own decision. The boring stuff like company history and technology are detailed at the beginning, but for those of you just interested in share price you can fast forward to **MARKET OPPORTUNITY**, **VALUATION ESTIMATE** and **TECHNICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS** toward the end.

I'm posting this now because I feel the current share price makes for a potential great entry near the 200-day moving average, on top of other technical and fundamental factors outlined below. Upcoming volatility will also be useful to those of us playing theta strategies. LFG.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **BACKGROUND:**

Lucid is an EV manufacturer based out of Newark, California. They were founded in 2007 as Atieva and initially focused on producing battery modules and powertrains for other manufacturers. Since their inception they have been awarded over 325 patents, 50 of which pertain directly to their core battery system in the US alone\*.

In 2013 Lucid enlisted the help of now-CEO/CTO Peter Rawlinson. Prior to this Peter was VP of Vehicle Engineering and chief engineer at Tesla helping to develop the Model S. Around this time Lucid was developing a 900 hp powertrain under the *Edna* test bed (basically a stripped dow utility van). In 2016 the company officially rebranded to Lucid Motors and revealed the earliest Lucid Air alpha prototype at the LA motor show.

In 2019 they broke ground on their Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona, the first purpose-built EV factory in the United States. The current factory is over 999k square feet with an additional 5.1 million square feet of building space planned on the 590-acre site\*. Recently over $350 million in CAPEX for 2021-2023 was brought forward to combine phases 2 and 3 of the AMP factory into one combined phase\*, with early construction already having begun\*. Once complete the total manufacturing output will be up to 400k vehicles per year, and eventually upgradeable to &gt; 500k vehicles per year. Lucid also has a powertrain factory (Lucid Manufacturing Plant-1, LMP-1) located 6 miles from AMP-1 where they manufacture all their battery modules, packs, inverters, drive units and wunderboxes\*.

Lucid aims to outcompete Tesla and other EV manufacturers on the basis of their technology, stating competition between Lucid and Tesla will be a ""two horse race.""\* In brief, the Lucid Air claims 1080 horsepower and 517 miles of range on the most energy dense powertrain to date. They offer a drag coefficient of 0.21\*, bested only by the Mercedes EQS. They are looking to compete in the luxury EV sector with an eye for what they term as ""post-luxury,"" emphasizing sustainability and user experience over opulence\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **TECHNOLOGY:**

***Motor***\*: Lucid utilizes a *permanent-magnet synchronous motor* which is much more efficient than a traditional induction motor (eg, those used by Tesla until the Model 3). Conceptually, every electric motor can be broken down into two primary components: the *stator* (outer housing) and the *rotor* (internal component). When an electric current is applied to coils lining the stator it generates a magnetic field, and when this current is phased the magnetic field begins to rotate. Magnets on the rotor are attracted to the rotating magnetic field causing the axle to rotate, thereby creating torque. As stated earlier these rotor magnets can be permanent (like Lucid and now Tesla) or electromagnetic. The latter is less efficient because it requires more wire → more resistance → more heat → decreased efficiency. By getting rid of that wire the permanent magnet motor takes up significantly less space and allows you to combine the inverter, transmission, differential and motor into a single smaller package. In Lucid's case this brings the weight of the entire assembly down to just 164 pounds. In conjunction with a proprietary cooling mechanism (axial jet cooling manifold) and a significant decrease to cogging torque this has allowed Lucid to create ***the most power-dense drive unit on the market*** at over 9 hp/kg (compared to Tesla's 3.2 hp/kg). That's ***280% more energy-dense than the nearest competitor.***

Lucid's highly efficient motor can deliver up to 670 hp and 2950 lb-ft of torque. The all-wheel-drive Air has two motors and delivers as much as 1,080 total hp with a 0-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds\*. Check out the timeline above to see videos of their speed records.





***Battery***: Any manufacturer can add more batteries to an EV and increase its range, but this only increases weight and does nothing to improve efficiency (""dumb range""). To this end Lucid has been working to maximize its battery efficiency for almost 14 years. One of the most important parts of this is their adoption of a **900+ volt architecture**, the highest in the industry. Why does this matter? Because for the same amount of power a higher voltage system allows you to use lower current (V=IR). Lower current means less heat generated and therefore less total losses. This is based on the I2R principle, where if you x2 your current you x4 your losses. For comparison, Tesla utilizes a 350 volt architecture and would have to nearly triple the current to deliver the same amount of power as Lucid. Since Lucid uses lower currents they can use smaller cables, less wires and therefore less material mass while increasing the vehicle's efficiency. Lucid uses a total of 22 battery modules to make a complete pack, with each module producing around 42 volts for a total of 924 volts, in a package weighing around 1100 pounds total. Each module produces 5.1 kWh and with 22 of them it comes out to **113 kWh total**. This gives the Air an estimated **517 miles total range** (*EPA verification pending*) with an **efficiency of 4.6 miles/kWh**. This is the most efficient battery pack on the market, with Tesla following behind at 4.0 miles/kWh and other manufacturers even further behind still. Peter Rawlinson has stated in 2-3 years 4.8 miles/kWh is achievable, and up to 6.0 miles/kWh in a smaller vehicle format (future Lucid coupe?)\*:



Higher volt architecture also allows the battery pack to be charged more rapidly than Lucid's competitors at up to 300kW, gaining nearly **300 miles of range in just 20 minutes**. For comparison the Porsche Taycan has previously *advertised* up to 350 kW charging but their own website now only reports only up to 270kW\*. The Tesla Model S Plaid offers up to 250 kW\*.

For battery chemistry Lucid has a contract with LG Chem to be their exclusive battery cell supplier\*. While the 2170-format cells are similar to those used by other EV manufacturers, Peter Rawlinson has stated that manufacturing a battery pack is 85% mechanical and only 15% chemistry. One innovative feature of Lucid's battery packs is utilization of end-cooling as opposed to side-cooling (like Tesla)\*. Not only is this more efficient it allows them to pack individual cells more tightly and to better optimize total energy density.

It should also be noted that Lucid has supplied all the battery packs for Formula E racing since 2018 using the 18650-format cells\*. This same technology powering Formula E will be driving you to KFC for the 4th time this week.

Some have argued that 517 miles of range is irrelevant if you're only driving to and from work every day, however keep in mind increased range does not simply imply longer individual trips—it also means less frequent charging. EV adoption has historically been tempered by *range anxiety*—the fear of running out of charge during a long trip. This type of range significantly decreases that anxiety and offers greater mobility than almost any commercial ICE sedan.

***Wunderbox***: Lucid calls this the heart of their electrical platform\*. It allows compatibility with—and the maximizing of—charging systems of differing voltages, specifically boost-voltage charging. It enables a wide array of future-ready bi-directional power delivery features. These include vehicle-to-grid (V2G) compatibility for situations such as managing home power outages as well as vehicle-to-vehicle charging (V2V).

***Dream Drive***: This is Lucid's Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS). It's made up of 32 total sensors including ultrasonic, radar and an industry-first high-definition LIDAR system. There is also an internal camera system for driver monitoring and can take over in difficult situations. The Dream Drive system will be updated over the air and will deliver level 2 driving at launch. Level 3 driver assistance and geo-fenced HD mapping will be updated OTA shortly thereafter. For comparison Tesla has admitted their ""Full Self-Driving"" system is still level 2 under the definition of US authorities\*. Nevertheless, I don't believe Lucid's intent here is to be the industry leader, and Peter Rawlinson has stated that true autonomous driving (levels 4-5) is still many years away. More information is available on Lucid's website\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **VEHICLES AND TRIMS:**

**Air sedan**: Lucid will start by offering the Air Dream Edition beginning this year (2021), with three additional trims being released sequentially over the next couple years. The Dream Edition is their top-of-the-line model and starts at a price of $161,500 (*after $7,500 tax credit in the US\**). Future models step down in price to the $69,900 Air Pure. Each are compared in the following image:

[\*US tax credits are on the fence with the infrastructure bill right now\*](

**Gravity SUV**: ""Project Gravity"" will be Lucid's entry into the lucrative SUV market\*. Prototypes have already been built\* using Lucid's Electric Advanced Platform (LEAP), the same modular platform upon which the Air is manufactured. Accordingly it should offer fairly similar specifications to that of its sedan sibling. The body will be a little wider than the Air but a good bit taller, seating up to 7 passengers. Production is expected to begin in 2H 2023.

[Project Gravity SUV](

**Additional vehicles:** Lucid has future plans for an additional coupe and pickup truck by 2030\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **CHARGING:**

Charging will be on the basis of Lucid-branded EV supply equipment as well as outside partnerships\*. Lucid's own equipment will supply AC charging at 10-20 kW using their standard portable EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) versus an optional wall mount through an official Lucid-Installation partner, QMerit or an electrician of the customer's choice. Lucid community partnerships will be capable of AC charging up to \~20kW and DC charging up to \~300kW. *Every vehicle sold will come with three years of free charging through an Electrify America*, and will be compatible with networks leveraging J1772 and CCS charging standards such as ChargePoint and EVgo\*.

Tesla's supercharger network has first-mover advantage but is highly capital intensive and limited to a legacy 400V maximum architecture, charging at 250 kW with the latest V3 units. Lucid's partnership with Electrify America is a much more CAPEX-light alternative and is compatible with 900V second-generation systems, charging at a maximum of 350 kW. It also uses the open-source CSS connector as apposed to Tesla's closed-source system.

Modern EVs are migrating to ultra high voltage architectures, eg, Porsche at 800V, Lucid at over 900V. Tesla systems and vehicles adopted 400V largely as a consequence of earlier technology.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

**▶ PEOPLE:**

Lucid has collected an impressive roster of executive leadership, many of which with resumés from some of Silicon Valley's most sought-after brands. An abbreviated biography is provided below, however the take-home point is the pedigree from which Lucid draws its talent. Companies such as **Apple, Intel, Waymo, Tesla, Audi, Ferrari** and **Ford** are represented and this positions Lucid well in terms of technical expertise and networking.

**Peter Rawlinson** (CEO/CTO) - Born in South Wales, UK. Studied Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London before graduating in 1979\*. Prior to Lucid he gathered over 30 years experience between being the Principal Engineer at Lotus Cars, Head of Vehicle Engineering at Corus Automotive and VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla (Sept 2009 - Jan 2012)\*. At Tesla he was the chief engineer of the Model S, responsible for its technical execution and delivery by improving both its structure and production\*. Peter would later join Atieva in 2013 as their Chief Technology Officer (CTO) before being promoted to CEO in 2019\*. Elon Musk has publicly tried to downplay Peter's role at Lucid via Twitter\*; however, this has been thoroughly verified and refuted\*.

**Sherry House** (CFO) - Sherry joined Lucid Motors as Chief Financial Officer in May 2021\*. Prior to Lucid she was Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations at Waymo LLC, an autonomous driving technology company and subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (Google)\*. She worked to guide the company's investments, acquisitions and external fundraising. She has an engineering background with BAs in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering, as well as an MBA and Masters of Manufacturing and Engineering.

**Derek Jenkins** (Senior VP or Design and Brand) - Derek currently oversees all design developments including exterior and interior design, user experience, color and material, accessories and design strategy\*. Before joining Lucid he was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments both locally and globally\*. Prior to Mazda he was the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America for 9 years, and was a designer for Audi in both Germany and the United States for eight years.

**Eric Bach** (Senior VP of Product and Chief Engineer) - Eric has guided numerous vehicles to market for both Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors\*. At Tesla he oversaw several engineering functions for the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 programs. Under his leadership his teams successfully enabled the Model S and Model X programs to deliver pioneering engineering and technology solutions under vastly accelerated timelines when compared to the industry at large.



Besides executive positions Lucid currently employs over 2,000 people and has a 4.2 out of 5 score on Glassdoor.com\*. There are currently 900+ job postings on their website indicating that they are growing very rapidly\*, expecting more than 4000 total employees by next year\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **MARKET OPPORTUNITY:**

**General EV market**: EV adoption is still very early. To draw an analogy, the growth of ICE automobiles per 1,000 people between 1900 and 1909 has a very strong correlation coefficient (98%) with the current growth of EVs between 2011 through 2020\*. This growth will almost certainly continue due to multiple factors, including supportive government policies and regulations promoting EV adoption, increasing investments from OEMs, rising environmental concerns and the decreasing cost of batteries. Keeping this in mind EVs are in a strong position to cannibalize the $5 trillion automobile market, and there's little debate over long-term industry growth. We are only at the beginning of what looks to be a parabolic growth curve, and time in the market will almost certainly beat timing the market.

**Luxury vehicle market**: In 2020 the EV market comprised 5% of all new car sales. Lucid is specifically targeting the luxury EV market which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5%, from $496 billion in 2018 to $742 billion in 2026.

**Total addressable market (TAM)**: For 2021-2022 Lucid anticipates the Air model to represent 2% of the total addressable EV market (*this number may change based on current commodities and chip markets*). By 2030 they estimate a run-rate production of &gt;500k vehicles, representing an estimated 4% of total market share.

**Production volume**: Production is underway at Lucid’s custom-built Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona with deliveries starting in the next few months (2H 2021). Lucid will start by selling various trims of the model Air (see above), however Project Gravity (2023) and future models (2025+) will contribute to future production estimates as outlined below:

* 2021 - 577 vehicles
* 2022 – 20,000 vehicles
* 2023 – 49,000 vehicles
* 2024 – 90,000 vehicles
* 2025 – 135,000 vehicles
* 2026 – 251,000 vehicles

*Note: these forecasts were published in late May 2021*\*. Lucid has since announced they are expediting phases 2 and 3 of their manufacturing plant into one combined phase, adding 2.7 million additional square feet of manufacturing space by 2023 and increasing production capacity to 53,000 vehicles by the same year\*\*\*\*. It is unclear how much this will affect production numbers in the years following but they would presumably increase.\*

**Revenue forecast**: Lucid is projecting 174% average annual total revenue growth, ramping from $2.2 billion in 2022 to 22.8 billion by 2026\*. Current expectations are for a **positive EBITDA by 2024** and to be **free cash flow positive by 2025**\*.



\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **FUTURE DIRECTION:**

Peter Rawlinson has said he sees three arms the Lucid Group of businesses: vehicles, electrical storage systems (ESS) and technology licensing. Vehicles are discussed above. Lucid has been developing an **electrical storage system** for some time and already has a working 300 kWh prototype at their headquarters in California\*. They are also working towards larger pilot project at the Lucid vehicle manufacturing facility in Arizona (AMP-1). Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of around 70% once they’re removed from EVs, which means they potentially have another decade of useful life\*. Much like Tesla's home battery packs this will allow Lucid to further leverage their own expertise in battery module design targeting home, commercial and utility scale applications. Automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor, and Audi AG have also initiated second-life pilot projects.



As a **technology supplier** Lucid already provides battery modules and software to all Formula E race cars (see above). In-house technology designed for mass production will position Lucid well for large scale supply to other OEMs. They advertise potential for a wide range of applications including aircraft, eVTOL, military, heavy machinery, agriculture and marine.

Lucid plans to expand into foreign markets in the near future, including Saudi Arabia as early as 2022\* and European markets thereafter. Lucid likely has a contractual obligation to the former as part of its deal with Public Investment Fund (PIF), having invested over $2.9 billion into Lucid Motors in 2018\*. If this continues as planned then total production volumes and revenues would significantly alter market opportunities and valuation estimates outlined above.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **VALUATION ESTIMATE:**

**Let's be honest this is probably the only reason you're here.** With that in mind Lucid is obviously a pre-production pre-revenue company, making an accurate estimation of its value both challenging and highly up to interpretation. One way we can approach this is by looking at its market capitalization, currently $35.1 billion at a share price of $21.67 (8/22/2021). With this in mind we can make the following comparisons:

|*Company*|*Valuation (8/22/2021)*|*Total debt*|*Price-to-sales (P/S) ratio*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Tesla (TSLA)|$673.5 billion|$11.1 billion (6/2021)\*|18.33\*|
|Toyota (TM)|$226.8 billion|$24.5 trillion (6/2021)\*|0.81\*|
|Volkswagen (VWAGY)|$144.6 billion|$219.2 billion (6/2021)\*|0.51\*|
|General Motors (GM)|$70.8 billion|$111.1 billion (6/2021)\*|0.51\*|
|Nio (NIO)|$57.9 billion|$2.7 billion (6/2021)\*|12.7\*|
|Honda (HMC)|$50.7 billion|$7.7 trillion (6/2021)\*|0.37\*|
|Ford (F)|$50.2 billion|$148.2 billion (6/2021)\*|0.37\*|
|Lucid (LCID)|$35.1 billion|$179 million\*|N/A *(see below)*|
|Xpeng|$30.8 billion|$2.7 billion (3/2021)\*|N/A|
|Li|$27.1 billion|$3.9 billion (3/2021)\*|N/A|
|Fisker (FSR)|$3.9 billion|$20.2 million (6/2021)\*|N/A|

This is based on an LCID share count of 1.619 billion. However, assuming the company exercises all available warrants (*they are all ITM*) there will soon be 1.704 billion shares outstanding, raising the LCID market capitalization to $36.93 billion. With this in mind we can try to estimate LCID's current value based on their own revenue projections of $22.8 billion by 2026\*. *If they meet this goal they are currently trading at 1.620 times future sales* ($36.93b/$22.8b). Since the market returns about 10% average per year we will assume a discount rate of 10% to bring future sales back down to present value. Given the term of 4.25 years (Sept 2021- Jan 2026) we can calculate LCID's net present value (NPV) as $15.2 billion\*. *As a result this means* ***LCID currently trades at a P/S ratio of 2.4x*** ($36.93b/$15.2b).

For comparison you can see TSLA trades at 18.3x sales and Nio at 12.7x sales. LCID at 2.4x may very well be undervalued in this scenario. However both TSLA and Nio are currently selling cars for the 0 Lucid currently has on the road. Lucid does however have over 11,000 paid pre-orders of the Air, including the completely reserved $169k Dream Edition.

With this in mind we might be able to target a P/S ratio of let's say 5. The technology sector currently averages a P/S ratio of 7.52\* so 5 seems more than fair. If that's the case then LCID has an upside potential of almost 106% (5/2.43). ***This would bring the share price to $44.64 with an estimated market capitalization of $76.1 billion.*** This is over a hypothetical 12 months but the rate is otherwise TBD. That may seem like a lot, but for a US manufacturer with the most efficient EV on the market I personally don't believe it is. This would put Lucid at a market capitalization close to the $70 billion being sought by Rivian for their IPO\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

**▶ TECHNICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS:**

I personally don't put a lot of weight into TA--certainly not in the short term. That said, LCID saw a peak of $64 during the early SPAC rumors in February 2021, then crashed hard after DA was officially announced. Like a lot of the market (especially EVs and tech) it continued a downtrend through spring and summer until reaching a nadir of $17.25 on 5/13/2021. This had been followed by an upward channel through 8/16/2021 but has since broken the lower support and moved below both the 50-hour and 200-hour moving averages. On the daily chart we're also below the 50-day and just scraping the top of the 200-day. RSI is currently near the oversold side and MACD looks to be making a reversal. Historically there are several points of support around $21.30 and we're currently just above this lower bound. Personally I think this makes a decent entry point if you're looking to go long.

[Nothing fancy, just bottom trend-line, 1-hour SMA, RSI and MACD](

Fundamentals are outlined above. PIPE lockup expires on 9/1/2021 and will likely create a good amount of volatility; however, since EPA/crash test results, press coverage and delivery announcements are expected in the very near future there look to be several factors either maintaining or potentially pulling the price upward. Motor Trend magazine will be publishing an article tomorrow (8/25/2021) regarding the first public test drive, with senior editor Jonny Lieberman testing out the 500+ mile range by driving between SF and LA this past weekend (tweet).

▶ **COMMON QUESTIONS:**

**Q:** ***When does PIPE lockup expire / will this drive down price?***

**A:** As per the most recent S-1 PIPE lockup should expire on 9/1/2021 (page 169). Here's a prior post thoroughly discussing PIPE lockup expiration and the effects it may have on share price. In brief, about 55% of PIPE investors might be considered long-term and 45% short-term. There are about 150 million PIPE shares, or 9.3% of all outstanding shares. If 45% of PIPE sells that's still only 4.2% of outstanding shares trading hands.

**Q:** ***When are deliveries?***

**A:** Lucid has only officially announced deliveries as second half of 2021. Motor Trend magazine's senior features editor Jonny Lieberman recently drove an Air Dream edition in tandem with Peter Rawlinson and was reportedly told Q3 2021, however he speculated it may be October (Q4).

**Q**: ***When is crash testing and EPA verification?***

**A:** No specifics at this time other than both are underway and ""near completion""\*.

**Q:** ***What about the chip shortage?***

**A:** Peter Rawlinson reports they have bought ahead, securing enough semiconductors for all production vehicles through 2021. They have additional mitigation plans for alternative sourcing and PCB redesigns if required. They have a relatively modest volume ramp for 2021, so they are less affected in the near-term than other manufacturers. You can watch Peter discuss the issue here (start at 4:00).

**Q:** ***What's the four-finger gesture Peter Rawlinson has been making in photos over the past few weeks? (examples*** 1, 2, 3, 4)

**A:** Jonny Lieberman claims to know and will publish the answer in tomorrow's Motor Trend article (8/25/2021). Best guesses are (A) confirmation of 1111 max horsepower, (B) big news on 9/4/2021as this is the ending date of the mandatory 40-day quiet period after listing on the NYSE, or (C) he's the last surviving member of Chicago's Four Corner Hustlers\*.

▶ **PERSONAL POSITION:**

I won't divulge my exact position other than to say LCID represents 55% of my total portfolio with a DCA of $23.90. I also have multiple calls/LEAPS, mostly Jan 2023 including $15, $20, $25 and $30 strikes, with a few Oct and Nov 2021 calls sprinkled in as lottery tickets. I wheel a smaller stack on the side to collect premium during the slower months and I'm currently trading on the CSP side. I buy a small number of shares almost every day and intend to make this a 5-10 year investment. If mods would like ""proof or ban"" I will happily provide screen shots privately.

BlackRock in an article stated that this cycle of regulation will last a couple years and they are staying away from China Tech “for a little while longer” 

“In tech, Liu said the big companies' earnings are affected not just by regulation but also competition. She noted new trends in e-commerce have prompted companies to invest more in infrastructure, which has a lower initial return on investment.

As a result, BlackRock plans to ""stay a little bit away from the large, dominant platforms for a little bit longer,"" Liu said.”

Well this article was written in June and Baba has come down a lot more since. We know that huge institutions like BlackRock will not give you a heads up as they start accumulating. But you will know when there are huge volume spikes. 

Fast forward to today. BABA on Monday made a fresh 52 week low then proceeded to end up green on MASSIVE volume. The volume continues in the Hong Kong markets and the volume is continuing today. I believe the quarterly reports from JD and PDD have shown the institutions the regulations are not affecting results as bad as they thought and are now in the process of reacquiring those 120M shares.

**Palantir** (PLTR) surged on Aug. 12 after it posted its second-quarter earnings. In a broader perspective, the stock has moved a lot since its IPO in September last year. Now, should you, as an investor, buy it?

**1. Accelerating growth** 

Palantir’s growth is accelerating since 2019. The second-quarter revenue rose as quickly as last quarter, namely 49% year over year. Revenue reached $376 million, beating estimates by $14.5 million. 

Palantir's government revenue growth slowed down from last quarter but it stayed at an astonishing pace, 66%. These deals are worth $232 million. Commercial revenue reached $144 million leading to a growth of 28%. 

&amp;#x200B;

[source: Palantir](

The slower growth in government contracts is offset by a fast acceleration in the commercial segment. This proves that Palantir has a growing number of customers who are not governments. This is essential as government contracts have less long-term growth potential than commercial contracts.

Palantir’s commercial growth comes from the U.S. market. Its U.S. commercial revenue surged 90% year over year. This should be compared to a 72% growth in the first quarter of 2021. If you consider the possibility to develop in Europe, the growth potential stays huge. 

## 2. Improving margin

Palantir remained unprofitable and the year-over-year comparison shows an increasing loss ($110.5 million vs $138.6 million). Its adjusted gross margin, which excludes its stock-based compensation and other one-time expenses, expanded from 80% to 82%. Its adjusted operating margin jumped from 11% to 31%.

Increasing margins mean that a company has market power, i.e. the possibility to set price above marginal costs. This strength comes from its experience with the U.S. government -- for which it aims to become the ""default operating system"" – which makes a great impression on customers.

## 3. Great guidance

Palantir hopes to generate $385 million in revenue in the third quarter, while investors expect $380 million.

Palantir also expects yearly growth of at least 30% until 2025. This would lead to revenue of $4 billion in 2025. The expectation for free cash flow in 2021 was raised from $150 million to over $300 million.

Now you likely better understand why Palantir has a price to sales of 30 times this year's sales.

## A drawback to consider:

Palantir's platform is really efficient in finding data from individuals, but its use is controversial.

Palantir's Gotham platform is used by all branches of the U.S. military, as well as government agencies like the FBI, CIA, and ICE. This omnipresence is good, but Palantir was also used to track down and report undocumented immigrants in the U.S. 

This use led to protest from activists and Palantir's own employees. **Amazon** Web Services’ -- which hosts Palantir -- employees called for its shutdown. If more controversies come to light, the stock can be under pressure.

## TLDR:

Palantir is one of the best companies in the market. Current social unrest will lead to increasing demand for its product. Moreover, the quality of services rendered to governments will attract a growing number of customers.

Palantir has set clear goals for the future, and it could easily surpass its 2025 targets as it expands its government and commercial businesses. Those growth opportunities should justify its relatively high valuation and offset any concerns about its controversial contracts.

Prior to the crash, the market had corrected around May of that year, then had a narrow blow-off rally which made its final top on Tuesday, August 25th, 1987. It then began what seemed like a normal and expected correction but continued down and eventually accelerated in mid-October. Between Tuesday, August 25th and Friday, October 16th, the market fell roughly 20% before finally crashing another 20% on Monday, October 19th.

To this day nobody really knows what caused the crash. There were likely multiple factors including excessive valuations and speculation, the Fed making a single rate hike in late August, and portfolio insurance which contributed to the acceleration of the crash towards the end.

In a surprising (perhaps) coincidence, the pattern of this crash was eerily similar to that of the 1929 stock market crash which also saw a minor correction in May of that year followed by a narrow, blow-off rally into the final top which occurred around Labor Day before beginning a correction which turned into a crash. The reason for that crash also was not entirely clear but began on the back of some very bearish commentary by a not particularly well respected market pundit named Roger Babson who was quickly dismissed as delusional and out of his element by a much smarter cohort of Harvard-educated economists. The only problem was that the market seemed to agree with Babson.

I say this as a ray of hope to the bears because the market over the past several months has followed a similar pattern and now with the NASDAQ 100 going vertical over the past three sessions on a smaller and smaller list of mega cap stocks rotating strength while the overall market has pretty much been flat the pattern feels awfully similar (of course we don't know whether it's actually a blow-off rally until after the fact). We also had a minor correction in May and have been in a near vertical narrow rally in the NASDAQ 100 and S&amp;P 500 (but really just the few mega caps have been almost entirely responsible for this). Remember, you do not need a single, obvious reason to trigger a massive correction/crash. In fact that has pretty much never happened.",Something for the Bears,66,8

In Q1 2022 they will also release their new gpus. Rumors say that Intel's top of the range gpu is on par with Nvidia's 3070. 

If they manage to pull that one of and flood the market with a decent number of graphic cards - they will be flying to the moon just based on that one.

Anyway, let's take a look at this POS. 

[Shitty Chinese Stocks\/ETF](

[BABA actually somewhat reflecting fundamentals](

BABA caught my eye last Friday, after the skew (call iv - put iv) jumped almost 5 vol points, for reference BABA now has a larger skew than both ARKK and HOOD, which means it's pretty high. This is partly because of a huge put position opened up in the September 100 strike, potentially some kind of delisting bet. 

[BABA Skew](

[BABA Vol Surface Skew](

&amp;#x200B;

This is somewhat of a double-edged sword, on one hand some fucker could know something we all don't and are expressing it with a largely convex positon, but on the other hand it could be some degenerate from this sub who robbed his wifes boyfriend a decided to spend it all on puts. Either way the outcome is the same, trend amplification.  This position could provide convexity to the downside and really put selling pressure on, or decay away and let BABA rally.

&amp;#x200B;

[Open Interest](

Of course, this isn't the only positioning, and if one wants to take a degenerate gamble on BABA, they probably should look into it more before they blow their entire life savings. A rough look at the volatility surface, it seems as if people are buying puts, and selling calls (maybe because the IV is high? idk who cares). Sentiment has fallen, people are concerned about China obviously and it shows, but the question here is it overcrowded? 

[Shitty IV Surface](

[Sentmient](

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously I don't know if it is, StarMine gives BABA a 60/100 on the short squeeze score, whatever the fuck that means.  But as people pile into short positions, institutions have started buying with vengeance under the surface. If you have heard of dark pools or whatever, they arent a perfect indicator, and there is a lot of noise in single names. What could easily be happening here is dealers trying to hedge options positions while minimizing transaction costs, but I can't shake the volume. Usually if someone really needs to get out of a trade, they will use a lit exchange, however on Friday there was both massive volume prints within the dark pools and the lit exchanges, certainly worth noting. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Short VOLUME](

[Dark Pool Volume](

[Dark Pool Activity](

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways back on track, lets crunch some numbers. Since BABA decided to rally today, I didn't have time to build surfaces that give me the best estimate on positioning (although my models are probably pretty shit anyway) so I had to half-ass it. Also since I wanted to post this shitty DD tonight, I only had time to fetch the positioning for the September expiration, but there is certainly a lot of gamma expiring in the near dated weeklys, but since I am just doing shitty napkin math here, it will do. 

Just by a quick and easy calculation, for a $1 move in BABA dealers are forced to take around $44,709,772.82 of liquidity,  that is a massive amount (remember we are using September exp as a proxy). For reference BABA traded around 88,541,300 shares on Monday, obviously they didn't all trade at the same price and there are both buyers and sellers included in volume, but that would be around $14,260,461,778   

With regards to sensitivity of implied volatility, quick and easy estimate of BABA  is around $241,385,45.38 again a massive number for a single stock (but again my models are probably pretty shit lol). What does this mean? If a bunch of those puts come in the money, we are gonna have somewhat of a cushion and could even squeeze out a rally. There is reflexivity in the market and with dealers acting as liquidity takers, there is an opportunity for violent moves especially to the upside if it interacts with a short squeeze.

In Q3 2020, Blink’s AR balance was at 957k. at the end of the year the company made an AFDA of 357K and collected only 253k. Assuming no AFDA, the growth in AR from 2019 to 2020 will be around 300%.  Inventory in Q3 was at 2.8m, by the end of the year the company increased it’s inventory by 800k and transferred 1.9m to its PPE balance leaving the ending amount at 1.8m. furthermore, the company recorded a provision for excess and obsolete inventory of 392k. If we ignore the transfer, inventory will be at 3.7m, scoring a growth of 172%. Both these rates exceed the 126% revenue growth rate the company was able to achieve in 2020. Suggesting that blink’s credit policy is too loose in efforts to drive sales and that it has weak inventory management controls.

The stock I'm pitching to you I used to hate. Dumpster fire. My wife's boyfriend would talk shit about it with me at the dinner table. 

**American Airlines (AAL) is a stock with some of the most negative sentiment around it in the market.** Sure it has a horse shit debt to equity ratio that would make even the most leveraged wall street bets autist throw up in their mouth, a real concern if interest rates on their debt spikes up that will lead management to giving blowjobs behind dumpsters at Arby's, and with delta variant concerns it can lead you as an ""investor"" being unable to sleep at night. 

**But does any of that even matter? Absolutely fucking not.**  

American Airlines has some awesome things going for it and is a tendie wagon waiting to be hopped on. **Now I know what your asking.......why the fuck would I invest in this** ""dumpster fire"", least favorite of the airline stocks by institutional investors that has diluted shareholders a ton with equity offerings during this pandemic to stay afloat?

Simple. Second level thinking. **Their latest earnings report tells a lot of good things that are backed up by numbers. People are overestimating how bad things are and American will come up looking very strong taking us to tendie town.** They reported significant revenue improvement in the second quarter, as domestic leisure travel has recovered quickly and business travel have begun to recover. 

**Investment Thesis:** American Airlines is going to fly high with higher than anticipated travelers, market has underestimated travelers. American Airlines has the largest fleet and the youngest among U.S major airlines which will dampen maintenance and fuel costs . Capital expenditures will also be lower then previous with fleet renewal largely already completed. They are also committed to pay down 15 billion dollars of debt by 2025. These factors will help them outperform their competitors bottom line and help deleverage the company. Enticing investors. And amidst all the chaos and hate right now, makes it a compelling investment to get in early before it works its way back to a market cap before Covid. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Tendies in Flight ](

&amp;#x200B;

**Updates from last earnings**

\- Passenger revenue increased 105.8% from the previous quarter, the largest increase we’ve seen from U.S. network carrier this quarter, on a 44.4% increase in capacity, a 29.5% increase in load factors to 77.0% and a 10% increase in yield. These metrics remain 24.6%, 11.1%, and 11.4% below 2019 levels, respectively.

 \- Management said business travel improved from roughly 20% of 2019 levels in March to 45% of 2019 levels in June and that much of the increase in demand was from travel within the West Coast. American has not traditionally had much of a presence in business travel on the West Coast, which suggests that the code-sharing alliance that American initiated with Alaska Airlines is expanding American’s relevant market. 

\- Adjusted cost per available seat mile decreased to 12.61 cents per mile from 16.45 in the prior quarter, as higher capacity allowed increased fixed-cost absorption. Management said it expects 2022 CASM to be flat relative to 2019 levels. 

**This company is turning things around and is an industry leader. People aren't seeing the positive in this company as it is being overlooked** and analysts are becoming more optimistic for the airline industry as they are all hiring again and things are really looking like they will make it through the pandemic. Things are getting better and soon business travel will be rampant once businesses realize they want to gain an edge over other competitors by meeting in person rather then a zoom call in a post pandemic world. 

American, even though very leveraged, should have no problem in the capital markets unless the pandemic just goes berzerk on the airline industry which is unlikely at this point. **The strongest part of my entire investment pitch is the fact that American Airlines has ""American"" in the name and the government can't let our national airline fail. So this literally cannot go tits up.** 

The price movement is at a great point to enter calls where you could double or triple profit going into Thanksgiving/Christmas season.

**TLDR**

Calls/Longs tendies if break upper line.

&amp;#x200B;

**Long read**

Palantir has higher lows and lower highs since DPO.

We can clearly see PLTR is in long term consolidation, when we connect these price actions.

Hence a break ,preferably a daily close, above the upper white trendline could trigger a strong trend continuation towards the upside. MACD in the daily chart still showing bullish momentum, further suggesting this potential.

However, as bullish as I am, I do not discount the small possibility of a downside if prices break below the lower white trend line.

### Executive degen 🚀🚀 TLDR summary:

- New IPO (Dec 2020).
- Seeking to disrupt a huge market ($4.2 trillion).
- They have the best tech in the space, with a 9 year lead in lending AI/ML (very good moat).
- Exceptional leadership, with founders being high level Google execs who left to start the company.
- Incredible financial results reported in their Q2'2021, growing +10x as much as the likes of TSLA.
- No fear of regulation as they have a ""No Action"" letter from US government body.
- Still at the very tip of their growth journey, having only 4% market share of the unsecured personal loan space = massive growth runway.


### For visual learners:

I've also made a video about this review, if like me you're more of a visual learner, and can get over my monotonous voice feel free to watch my video on [Why You Should Own Upstart](

# Intro

I've been heavily reading up on [Upstart]( for the last few months, and I believe we're looking at a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here (despite being up [362.37%]( since IPO already). From everything I've read about the technology, leadership and market and competition, I think we're looking at a future tech behemoth currently hiding in plain sight. 

I've compiled my notes in the report below, if you need the *executive degen TLDR*, or prefer visual notes you can head straight to the bottom.

# Company History

Borrowing &amp; lending is a practice as old as time. Our economies are based on borrowing be it at government level, institutional level, or even at the individual level. Whats mind-blowing is that borrowing and lending remained largely the same for the last [5000 years]( The problem Upstart set out to solve is the question of how to quantify the borrower's risk of defaulting. In simple terms, there are a lot of ""[good borrowers""]( out there, but lenders generally have a hard time identifying them using current systems which are [old and dated]( So just like shopping (AMZN, SHOP..etc), EV (TSLA) and consumer tech (AAPL),  consumer lending, a [$4.2 trillion market]( was due a massive tech disruption (UPST).

Key dates:

- Founded in 2012
- [Pivoted]( from its initial niche (crowdfunding loans) to the larger [$84b]( market of personal loans in 2014.
- Entered the auto-lending market in [2020](
- [IPOed]( late 2020

# Leadership

The story of Upstart is quite unusual. The company was founded by three people with diverse backgrounds expertises, and even generations. Dave Girouard was the [former head of Google Enterprise]( and before that he was an executive at Apple. His co-founders are Anna Counselman, the former [manager of Online Sales &amp; Operations]( at Google and Paul Gu, a university student who dropped out of the computer science program at Yale to start the company (also a [Thiel Fellow]( For a founding story, its unusual for three people to come together and decide to build a company on the spot. But 9 years later, they are still at the helm of a profitable and disruptive company. 

# Upstart's Business

Upstart's business caters to two distinct segments: [Individuals]( and [banks](

Their offerings to individuals consist of a variety of personal loan products, examples of these include:

- Credit card and Debt consolidation loans
- Home improvement loans
- Medical loans
- Wedding loans
- and Moving loans

For banks, Upstart offers its AI technology as a way for banks to improve their archaic lending processes. This is kind of genius because instead of competing with banks, Upstart [partners with them and complements their services]( Studies completed with several  US banks suggested that Upstart’s model [could approve almost three times](  the number of borrows at the same loss rate as traditional models, as well as make a reduction of 75% in defaults at the same approval rate, this is unprecedented in the lending business.

## The Problem

At the moment, [90% of the top lenders in the United States use FICO scoring]( to assess credit-worthiness, this is a scoring system first developed in 1989 which is comprised of five components:

- Payment history
- Amount owed
- Length of credit history
- How many times someone has applied for new credit
- The variety of credit products you currently have

## The Solution

This old scoring system prevents many people from getting loans at a reasonable rate. By comparison, Upstart leverages [1600 different data points]( [fast forward to 05:35]  that have been trained on more than 10 million repayment events to reach decision within seconds. This machine learning model continues to get more effective as it processes more repayment data [!!]

And this is Upstart's competitive edge. Their AI and machine learning models facilitate *better* borrower selection and provides both *higher* approval rates as well as *lower* interest rates for customers. The numbers here are staggering: tested Upstart models were found to approve [26% more borrowers than traditional models whilst yielding 10% lower average APRs for approved loans]( This expands access to prime credit, which is great for customers (but its also great for banks as they would approve almost **twice** as many borrowers with fewer defaults). This is a [win win]( [start at 03:00] situation for both lenders and customers seeking credit, absolutely mind-blowing!

Upstart's AI also increases automation throughout the lending process for banks and institutional buyers. To illustrate this point they recently reported that [71% of their loans were instantly approved and fully automated]( -[page. 4] - with no need for document uploads, calls or waiting! 

Upstart is using state-of-the-art AI technology to disrupt:

- [$84B unsecured personal loan market]( [p.6] (already working product, ~4% of the market).
- $635B auto-loans market [also p.6] (just acquired Prodigy, a leader in this space).
- $4.2T US consumer credit market [also p.6]

## How Upstart makes money

From page 101 of Upstart's [SEC filing](

&gt; Upstart’s revenues are primarily earned in the form of three separate usage-based fees, which can be either dollar or percentage based depending on the contractual arrangement. We charge our bank partners a referral fee of 3% to 4% of the loan principal amount each time we refer a borrower who obtains a loan. Separately, we charge bank partners a platform fee of approximately 2% of loan value each time they originate a loan using our platform. These fees are contracted for and charged separately, although they are generally combined for accounting purposes as they usually represent a single performance obligation. We do not charge the borrowers on our platform any referral, platform or other similar fees for our loan matching services.

&gt; We also charge the holder of the loan (either a bank or institutional investor) an ongoing 0.5% to 1% annualized servicing fee based on the outstanding principal over the lifetime of the loan for ongoing servicing of the loan. Taken together, these fees represented 98% of our revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. In addition, we earn a small portion of our revenue from interest income and our securitization activities.

## The Competition

Another point that makes the case for Upstart's future growth is just how far ahead they are from the competition. As an example the scoring methodology used by Goldman Sachs, the underwriting partner of Apple responsible for Apple Card, has been the subject of much public scrutiny and criticism in a number of recent high profile cases. One example being the case of David Hansson the creator of Ruby on Rails who in late 2019 received [20x the credit limit of his wife despite sharing the same financial ability]( Another more recent example is when the CEO of Cloudflare, Mathew Prince [applied for an Apple card and received credit limit of only $4500]( at a rate of 21.99% APR, [despite being worth $4.2 billion](

These examples may appear trivial, and they are.. after all we are discussing billionaires being denied credit, but they are high-profile examples of the competition's inferior AI offerings. Besides, the questions and concerns around lending and borrowing in the age of artificial intelligence are very much real, and touch upon very important questions about access and fairness, an aspect of Upstart's offering that is quite compelling. [Listen to Jeff Keltner]( [47:20], Upstart's head of Business development touching on Upstart's effectiveness as a fair lender:

# Financials

To better understand how the business of Upstart is doing, lets take a look at their [most recent earnings report of the second quarter of 2021 published just about a week ago on August 10]( I will preface this by saying that its one of the best earning reports I've ever read! 

- **Revenue:** In the 2nd quarter of 2021 Upstart reported revenue of **$194 million**, this is an increase of - get this-  **1,018%** from the second quarter of 2020 [!!!]. I can not stress how impressive this is, even by growth stocks standards, you simply dont see numbers like this everyday!

    To illustrate just how out of this world Upstart's revenue growth is, lets look at revenue growth reported by other more popular degen-type growth stocks for the same quarter: 

    - **[Tesla reported revenue]( of** $11.69 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of **98%**.
    - **[SoFi reported revenue]( of** $231.3 million, representing a year-over-year increase of **101%**
    - **[Shopify's reported revenue]( of** $1.12 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 57%
    - **[Palantir reported revenue]( of** $376 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 49%
    - **[Fiverr reported revenue]( of** $75.3 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 60%
    - **[Etsy reported revenue]( of** $529 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 23%

    ...etc etc, I can go on. 

    Even if you account for this improvement being partly due to COVID, looking at the results sequentially you still see an improvement of 60% from $121 million in the first quarter of 2021 to $194 million in the second quarter. No matter how you look at it this is an incredible result.

- Transaction Volume Growth was up **69%**

    Upstart's bank partners originated 286,864 loans, totaling $2.80 billion, this is up 1,605% from the same quarter of the prior year. Conversion on rate requests was 24% in the second quarter of 2021, up from 9% in the same quarter of the prior year.

- **Income from Operations:** Income from operations was $36.3 million, up from ($11.4) million the prior year.
- **Contribution Profit:** Contribution profit was $96.7 million, up **2,171**% from in the second quarter of 2020, with a contribution margin of 52% compared to a 32% contribution margin in the second quarter of 2020.
- **Adjusted EBITDA**. Adjusted EBITDA was $59.5 million, up from ($3.1) million in the same quarter prior year.

In terms of financial outlook for 2021, Upstart expects:

- **Revenue of approximately $750 million (they have essentially raised guidance by $150 million since their previous report guided for $600 million)**
- **Contribution Margin of approximately 45% (vs prior guidance of 42%)**
- **Adjusted EBITDA Margin of approximately 17% (vs prior guidance of 10%)**

***Sirs, do you get it?***

I cant overstate how incredible these results are. As I was listening to the earnings conference call, I caught an amusing moment when the Director of Equity Research for Bank of America could not help but address the fact that he has never seen a four-digit growth figure reported in his career.. [have a listen yourself]( [35:40]. 

What the bank of America analyst correctly pointed out was that Upstart managed to achieve such incredible levels of growth at a time when the personal loan market across the United States was actually down.

# Risks:

- In terms of risks to investing in Upstart, one of the main issues facing the company is business concentration. Cross River Bank is Upstart’s most significant partner, [with fees received from the bank accounting for 60% of revenue]( [p.9]. Having a single customer generating such a big portion of your revenue is a serious risk for any business. The good news is that Cross River’s concentration of Upstart’s business has come down meaningfully over the last year from 79% to the current 60%. The hope is that, increased Upstart partnership with other banks will diversify its funding base and thus reduce concentration risk.
- Another risk is increased [regulations]( or legal scrutiny that can stop or restrict Upstart's AI models. This is obviously a real risk, particularly given how new AI lending is. The good news is that Upstart received a [no-action letter]( from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that essentially guarantees no supervisory or enforcement action against Upstart for the next few years.

## Future

- In terms of Upstart's future plans for expansion, the company plans to target the $635 billion Auto lending market. [They've already expanded to 47 states]( (up from 33 states last quarter), thus having access to more than 95% of the US population. They've also increased their dealership footprint by 24% sequentially this quarter.

    But their biggest move in the auto lending space has to be the [acquisition of Prodigy Software]( which is a leader in the automotive retail software space. Paul Gu, the co-founder of Upstart describes **Prodigy as the"" Shopify for car dealerships""** .

    Through acquisition of Prodigy Upstart was able to generate vehicle sales of over $1 billion this quarter, another very impressive result. They also already have five bank partners signed up for auto lending on their platform.

- Recently, Upstart filled a newly created [General Manager of Mortgage position]( This signals early stages of offering a mortgage product which would mean entry to a massive $2.5 trillion dollar category.

To conclude this section on the future of Upstart, I will leave you with [a short clip]( of Upstart's CEO discussing how the company is setting out to be the biggest player in AI lending in the world. My main takeaway from this interview was just how early we are to the Upstart story [23:45].

# Putting my money where my mouth is

In short, [YES]( I am a mere mortal so no over the top yolos. I mainly invest in growth stocks and have recently been adding to my Upstart position like crazy, taking it from 11% to around 30% of my portfolio. 

# Conclusion

Upstart reminds me so much of Shopify at the beginning of its growth-spurt, in the sense that it is a future giant hiding in plain sight. Do your own due diligence on the company before making any investments, but after many many hours of consuming every bit of data I can get on the company, I believe it will a massive success over the next 5 years, and we will all look back and wonder why we didnt invest enough.

This is a once-in-a-life-time opportunity imho.

* This should not be construed as investment advice, and since you are here, you should not be construed as an investor.
* Seriously, I've been wrong many times and 500k is an amount I'm willing to walk away from.

* I'm long SLQT via a basket of options and shares.   Something something.  Ok, I think I've exceeded the attention span of the average ape, so I will begin my analysis.

# Background on SLQT

SelectQuote (SLQT) is an insurance agency that specializes in selling healthcare to seniors, life insurance and home/auto insurance.   Yeah, I know, it's not a mattress company.

One of your key drivers in a business like this is your ability to attract and retain licensed insurance agents as most of these policies are sold over the phone.  Retention is key as most revenue happens during the annual October 15 - December 7 Medicare open enrollment period.   During the rest of the year, the goal is to keep you agents happy and productive any way you can in order to have them ready for peak season, as agents are your limiting factor.

August 25th PM is annual earnings, which means we get our annual forecast as well.  SQLT's fiscal year ends June 30.

# May 3 Pharmacy Announcement

IMO, what makes this play interesting is that the core business in undervalued AND there is a new adjunct business (pharmacy) that should power a solid FY2022 that was announced on May 3.   There was a [press release]( [an investor presentation]( and [an investor conference call](   I highly recommend you review all three.   All of this should become apparent with annual guidance in a few days.

Slide 19 - May 3 Investor Presentation:

[You can fit so many Boomers in this pharmacy!](

Slide 20 - May 3 Investor Presentation:

[Numbers, numbers, numbers](

We learn from the investor conference call and the recent earnings call that SLQT had an 80% opt-in rate and 30,000 members sign up for Population Health in about the first month of operations.   We also learned that they are going back and contacting previous sales with this initiative with an 85% successful contact rate, in addition to pitching Population Health to current sales (500k policies per year per slide 19).   Population Health is a free advisory service that they use to advise people to use their pharmacy:  SelectRx.

I took their low estimate of 50k members using the pharmacy and straight lined it to 100k members over FY 2022 to create my own estimate of direct incremental impact to the business from their pharmacy.   This assumes a 10% attach rate growing to a 20% attach rate on 500k policies sold--far lower than the 80% of people opting into Population Health.   We also don't know how successful their historical outreach will be in terms of pharmacy conversions (they only stated an 85% contact rate--which is way high... old people have nothing better to do than answer their phones...).

&amp;#x200B;

[Drug dealing is very profitable.](

So, I'm forecasting a 320.4M increase in revenue due to the pharmacy and 32.4M increase in EBITDA, which in this case should largely flow to net income.  I add these to my forecast for the core business.

# Core Business

FY 2022 Quarterly Forecast - Low Growth

[My \\""low\\"" forecast](

FY 2022 Quarterly Forecast - High Growth

[My \\""high\\"" forecast](

The core business has been growing at quite a clip.  As of this moment I'm writing, the stock is trading at $13.57, which is a measly 16.35x trailing twelve months Net Income, when you assume the midpoint of guidance for calendar quarter Q2 2021 (which is FY Q4) that was provided on the last earnings call.  This is very intriguing when you look at recent growth rates of the business over the previous quarters (90.54% YoY, 103.22% YoY, and 79.62% YoY).

The yellow highlight is a discrepancy I found between reported EPS (which was reported massively negative) and net income (which was reported massively positive).  Since we don't believe in math or fundamentals around here, I simply put the EPS based upon the Net Income divided by shares reported and highlighted it in yellow to make me look like I have something intelligent to say about it, but I really don't.  I'm going to pull a Biden and say that something that happened 4 or 5 quarters ago just doesn't matter.

That being said, the reason for the drop after the May earnings call (the May pharmacy announcement did pretty much nothing to the price action) was the guidance that showed deceleration in growth to 27.70% for Q2 2021 CY (the number in a red box).   We had a second drop off in the last few weeks when GoHealth had a train wreck of an earnings call.   I'm betting SLQT goes the other way, especially when you consider the guidance for FY 2022.

&amp;#x200B;

[My FY2022 range of forecasts](

Clearly to get an understanding of where this business is going, we need to accurately predict YoY sales growth on a quarterly basis for the core business (YoY by quarter is going to be a decent representation given the seasonal nature of insurance sales).

I proposed two different sales growth scenarios on the core business:

1. On the high side, growth decelerates to 80%, 80%, 80%, &amp; 25% (a strong Q3 will be an anomaly due to a special enrollment period that ended August 15, but it is present nonetheless in the forecast)
2. On the low side, the QoQ growth deceleration into CYQ2 represents the beginning of the collapse in growth:  25% YoY for all four quarters.

In both cases, these are forecasts for the core business of insurance sales.   I layer on pharmacy sales based upon the forecasts provided by the company on the May 3rd presentation, but rather than taking a midpoint, I straight line member growth over the year between the low to the high, and I assume the lower number of 6 Rx's per patient.   For Pharmacy gross margins, I use the forecasted ratio (the worst one).   I assume no marketing, as this is what they said in their pharmacy call.

# Stock Price Predictions

You can see from the above chart, if we keep the low P/E ratio of 16.35x for a fast growing company, we end up with a price target between $18.74 to $28.45 based upon forecasted Net Income.  My low estimate of $1.15 is lower than the [Marketbeat consensus]( of $1.23 for next year as well.

A few key points on my prediction:

* I believe that market will adjust the price of this stock abruptly in the next few days due to FY2022 earnings guidance coming out and then gradually over the coming quarter.
* I believe the market largely ignored SLQT when it started discussing pharmacy on May 3rd and the conference call a few days later.   This is a key strategic push for them, and according to the CFO on the last call, is one of three key drivers for FY22 (in addition to LHA and Senior).
* I believe the market has mispriced the core business as well.   The GoHealth driven drop was a bad sympathy play that created a great entry.   Without that drop, the market was pricing in a total collapse in the growth vector of this company, which I just don't believe.    The insurance sales market is very lumpy with its seasonality.   Some quarters aren't going to grow as strong as others due to timing of open enrollment periods and market potential (or, in better words, lack thereof).   I expect previously strong growth quarters to decelerate, but not so drastically as a reduction to 25% YoY across the board.

# My Positions

[Via Excel](

[Via Thinkorswim](

I played my positions according to my thesis.  I believe we have an immediate correction back up to where we were before GoHealth.   And then I believe we have a gradual rise to $20 over the coming quarter.

That would theoretically limit Palantir's growth and acquisition of new customers and might mean that PLTR will never grow into its valuation. However, I do not agree with them.

Here is my take on this matter. First of all, the fact that PLTR's software is very complex and rather expensive has its benefits. For example, if company x spends a lot of resources and time to integrate PLTR's software into its business operations there will be a very low-chance that they will terminate their contract at least in the mid-term and that is even without taking into account the software's capabillities and the fact that it has the potential to completely transform a company's business. As the CEO himself said : "" We are trying to build the go to OS for the modern enterprise"". Also, it seems that it would be very hard for a PLTR's competitor to emerge, because the barriers for entry are very high. (Palantir spend nearly 20 years and billions of dollars developing their product). We can't say the same thing about other soft. companies that offer way simpler solutions.

Now, let's talk about scalability. The main advantage that other generously valued companies like SNOW ""have over"" PLTR.  Well,. things are actually starting to change very fast. A lot of people do not know this, but everytime when PLTR enters a new industry it learns about the specific needs the companies in this industry have and that greatly helps with scalalbility. On the earnings call, they said that one of the largest european banks with over 10000 branches came to them with some problem related to money-laundering and they managed to solve it in just 2 days, while in the past it would have taken them months. Furthermore, they have recently started partnerships with other companies which will also help with the faster adoption of their software. They have put Foundry on the IBM and Amzn clouds and they have also successfully integrated BlackSky's software on top of Foundry for a government project related to geospatial intelligence. Last, but not least they have a started a new program pointed towards smaller innovative companies in which they are offering their software on a subscription-based model.

It's been a minute since my last DD. To preface this, after this bear bet, I've decided to largely go back to long(er) term options plays. I'll be writing about those later.

Now, without further ado, I have been bearish on Lucid for awhile now in private conversations. I'll speak about the fundamentals later on in this post, but I wanted to focus on short term micro-trends for a bit. As you may well be aware, Lucid had a division whereby 69% of its equity was rolled over under the terms of the SPAC and 10.5% went to PIPE investors at a heightened offering of 15$ per share. The rest went to spac holders.

The reason for the heightened price was because unlike the roll over equity which has a 6 month lock up period, the PIPE investors only have a 1 month lock-up period which expires on the 1st of September. Traditionally, firms that have paid higher IPO prices have done so because they then scalp retail investors on the first day of an investor by selling it at a mark up. I see no reason why at current prices, these investors would not do so. As it stands right now, it would be a 43.33% mark up to what they paid for a month of waiting.

The market understands the volatility this will bring, which is why options are so high. Initially i wanted to get January 2022 or 2023 calls, but the IV is significantly high for even these companies. Furthermore, the price has been trending down as investors in the know exit in preparation of the severe buying pressure. While some may argue that the names behind the PIPE wouldn't sell, the truth of the matter is that they are likely eyeing the deteriorating share price and each other with concern. The way that I would most likely categorize this is a Texas standoff, which would soon devolve into a turkey shoot. You need not look far to see the effect this would have as the severe selling pressure, and small float relative to the selling pressure will have strong downward pressures on the stock which will likely compound as stop losses and retail investors head for the exits after bearing significant losses. SOFI comes to mind.

I'll briefly speak about the fundamentals of the company, even though this isn't really a long term bearish play. This company does not have economies of scale like GM, Ford, or Stellantis. This means that it doesn't have the ability to absorb high commodity costs as well as them, or so easily source chips. More specifically when I refer to commodity costs, I am especially looking at steel and aluminum. Furthermore, I look at the supply chain and logistics issues, and can't help but feel they do not have economies of scale there either. In short margin compression will be real, and they will not have the economies of scale that their competitors do to negotiate better bulk rates.

To add to this, they do not have the first movers advantage that Tesla had, nor its free marketing which allowed them to have virtually no advertising spend. They also need to produce vehicles to get regulatory credits to sell to other car companies, except those car companies are rapidly going green which means they need to buy less regulatory credits (with that said, they're more likely to buy those credits from Tesla than Lucid).

I also don't believe that they will be starting to manufacture the cars anytime soon this year (if they eve do). If they actually keep to their H2 schedule for the start of production, I believe that it will only be in late November/ early December. Their goal of 20,000 in sales for their luxury vehicle in 2022 would significantly outperform the Mustang Mach E (Which outsold the Model s), the Porsche Taycan, and every other electric sports car out there. While they may get sales to SA considering it's investments in Lucid, the logistics costs (Spot container shipping costs) and manufacturing costs would be extravagant and deeply cut into margins. Not to mention figuring out how to source the chips.

Finally, I don't think that this company is being realistic in its goals (1.689B in net income by the end of 2026, I mean come on) and considering the 1.62B shares outstanding (not including warrants) and the share based compensation that will accrue, I can't fault myself for thinking that the companies EPS even if it matched them would be unappetizing for the amount of risk involved. It would leave them with an EPS of roughly 1, which would give them a forward P/E valuation of roughly 21.5 for 2026. GM has a p/e below 5.7, while having a proven CEO with a solid vision. With that said, let's not kid ourselves and think there will not be delays to their various product lines, and other various hiccups.

If you want to invest in electric cars, do what the smart investors of old did. Invest in people that win if the sector wins, not those competing within the sector. Battery makers, lithium/nickel miners, chip manufacturers and designers, and other assorted things that go into -every- car.

Today we're taking a short break from your small pp YOLOs and Loss Porn, and we're stepping up the game.

In this series, we'll dive into the stories of the most degenerate traders history has ever seen. They're so stupid they make [u/1R0NYMAN]( and [u/ControlTheNarrative]( look like a bunch of undergrads gambling with their rent money.

""Why should I care? I can already lose money very nicely on my own"". Well because, learning a bit more about the history of the market probably won't hurt, since you're probably still wondering how shorting a stock work and the greeks are just an old civilization for you. I also want you to pay attention to the mistake these gamblers made, so we can all stop writing off our donations to our favorite Market Makers.

And it's also a nice story to tell the Goldman intern you met at your local bar. Maybe you'll impress her maybe not. I'm not sure your wife's boyfriend will find much interest in it, though. He's still trying to file a lawsuit against RH, we'll see where that leads him. Anyways, if you'd rather max out your credit card to double down on MVST that's your choice, for the other's let's dive right in.

Today we'll talk about Baring's Bank. Founded in 1762 Barings bank was an English institution associated with class longevity and strength so much so that even the queen of England had an account with them then in 1995 this grand banking legacy was destroyed single-handedly by **one trader, Nick Leeson.** First, we need to quickly talk about futures.

**Futures 101**

I'll be quick this time. Essentially, futures are like options but they **oblige** each party to buy or sell random garbage at a pre-defined price and date. With futures, you have to deliver the goods or cash on the settlement date. In some cases, futures contracts will require physical delivery. In this scenario, the investor holding the contract upon expiration would be responsible for storing the goods and would need to cover costs for material handling, physical storage, and insurance.

Assume two gamblers enter into a one-year Crude Oil Futures contract at a futures price of $58.40 (think of it as the strike price). Regardless of the commodity’s spot price on the settlement date, the buyer is **obligated** to purchase 1,000 barrels of crude oil from the seller. If the spot price on the agreed settlement day is below $58.40, the long contract holder loses, and the short position gains. The long can just buy on the open market for less than 58.40$. Just like for a call, why would exercise a 100C if the stock trades for 90$. If the spot price is above the futures price of $58.40, the long position profits, and the seller records a loss.

Why does this matter? When you buy an option, you have a limited loss, you can only lose your premium. Futures are a **lot riskier.** Futures are highly leveraged. Indeed, when buying a futures, your broker only asks you to put a fraction of the value of the contract up front. Usually between 1/10 and 1/20 of the value of the contract, but sometimes even less! You could be buying. You could be trading a futures worth 100'000$ with just a mere 2'000$ depending on the contract. What you put upfront is called initial margin.

Your position is then adjusted daily. Whatever you win is added to your 2'000$ balance, but whatever you lose is deducted from that. In our case, just a 2% downward move is enough to wipe out your 2'000$, when that happens you get the dreaded ""margin call"" (I bet most of you are familiar with that) and you have to put more money upfront to cover your losses and keep your positions open. Otherwise, you can say goodbye to your house and your vintage Pokemon Card collection.

It gets a lot more complex, I don't want to see a wannabe nerd in the comments flexing about his Investopedia knowledge, let's have a proper intellectual brawl in the DMs.

**An English Man With Big Balls and a Small Brain**

Our degenerate trader was born in England, an unimpressive student, with an average educational performance. Our degenerate was desperate to become a trader, so much so that he quit Morgan Stanley because he didn't get promoted to trader there.

Baring's bank was stupid enough to give him a job. Leeson was an OG Savage, the dude said he never heard of the bank before applying and deeply despised them. Barings was no ordinary bank, it catered to the most affluent class of people in the banking industry. The Baring's name was respected, it was a very safe bank and they could raise capital very easily. Behind the scenes, its operations were struggling to keep up with the modern banking world. Think about RH vs a real broker like IBKR, just a totally different environment

From his position as one of the bank's bookkeepers it didn't take him very long to find flaws in how the bank operated Baring's bank was crumbling during a time when most other financial institutions were thriving. Feeding on the good standing that comes with two centuries of global trading, it would survive though much like it always had. What bearings wouldn't survive would be hiring Nick Leeson, quite a flex.

Barings offered him the position of a trader. He would be in charge of a newly founded futures division in Singapore, and losing money **professionally**. This was the opportunity that Leeson had been waiting for and quite possibly the worst decision that Barings had ever made. Barings shortly got the approval to trade in Singapore and it was go-time. Trading primarily on the Nikkei (the S&amp;P in Japan) Nick thoroughly enjoyed the stress and pressure of futures trading.

On behalf of his clients, Leeson was primarily trading futures on the Nikkei, the primary index in Tokyo. Leeson should have been managing a **cash-neutral business**. This strategy entails managing an investment portfolio without adding any capital. Unlike, your broke-ass trading account, banks don't like adding cash to parts of the business that lose money.

In Leeson's case, if money was made or lost on the trades, it would have belonged to the clients. Let me be clear, most of you think traders at banks are just fancier versions of yourselves with a suit and a degree, but no. At banks, 99% of the transactions are traded **on behalf of clients.** There's no smarty pants Garry who risks the banks money because he has a Bloomberg Terminal and a fancy suit.

Barings' only compensation on the trades should have been a commission, and only a small amount of the trades were meant to be proprietary, or on behalf of the bank itself. However, Leeson was no ordinary banker. Foods Stamps or Lambo, he quickly began making unauthorized trades. At first, these risky positions made large profits for the bank: as much as £10 million, accounting for 10% of Barings' annual profit in 1992.

Because Barings had given him the responsibility of double-checking his own trades, rather than reporting them to a superior, Leeson was able to hide the losses from his bad trades in a secret account...

**Account 88888 and the beginning of the downfall**

Unlike you and me, when we YOLO our family's savings into SPY calls or AAL lotto's (thinking of [u/luhkyskills]( and we take a big fat L, well we just have to suck it and go to our weekly shift at Wendy's. Leeson, however, was too good for that and he chose another strategy to hide his losses.

On July 3, 1992, only two days after Barings was granted membership by SIMEX, Leeson opened Account 88888, and that same day, the first transaction was booked in this account. Apparently, Lesson asked one of his Chinese co-workers what her favorite number was, she said 8. In China, 8 is known to be the luckiest number of all, so Leeson said we might as well get all the luck we can get, let's name the account 88888, we'll see how that worked out for him.

On Baring’s system, this account was described as **an error account**. It is common for traders to set up such an account for the purpose of netting minor trading mistakes.

The net position should be closed each day and the net value of gains and losses incurred in negating the position should be recorded as part of the unit’s daily profit Leeson. However, already during the first month of its existence, a large number of transactions were booked in Account 88888, which shows according to the Singapore Report that it could never have been intended to serve solely as an error account. As a matter of fact, Leeson gave specific instructions around July 8, 1992, to ensure that his actions would not be transparent.

*“The first time I do anything, I’m not expecting to survive more than two days,”* he later recounted. But head office kept sending the funds needed to cover margin payments and Leeson began to understand that he could successfully hide his mistakes. *“As you get past the two-day period, then you start to get more confidence because it isn’t being found. To me it’s obvious, if they can’t see it after two days then they are not going to see it after 200 days, 500 days, 1,000 days. It’s easy.”*

During 1993, the main focus of Leeson’s unauthorized speculative positions in Account 88888 was the generation of profits in the ordinary trading accounts for their clients or proprietary traders. This enabled Leeson to gain a reputation as a star trader on SIMEX and enhanced his intra firm executive standing. However, by the end of 1993, the cumulative losses in Account 88888 were over ¥4 billion about US$35.8 million, which made the situation much more complex. Leeson’s main problem became the management of the flow of funds to support the margin calls from SIMEX.

An important way to arrange the funding was by manipulating the trading and accounting records. This was done in a number of ways. First, most transactions booked in Account 88888 were initially booked in the accounts of Barings. If these positions had been correctly reported to management, it would have been clear that risk limits had been exceeded, since such transactions were not hedged.

However, Leeson would execute offsetting trades about 30 seconds before market close to place transactions from Baring's accounts into Account 88888. With these so-called transfer trades, Leeson avoided disclosure of unhedged positions in the reports to Baring's. The prices of these transfer trades were later adjusted to favor Barings, at the expense of Account 88888, in order to confirm his reputation as an exceptional trader.

This would often require complicated alterations between different sets of records. A second way to manipulate the records was to record fictitious trades between the accounts of Barings and Account 88888 in the daily list of transactions when no transfer trades had been executed. The effect was that unhedged positions were transferred from the Barings accounts to Account 88888, so that no unhedged positions were reported at the end of the day.

Finally, Leeson often instructed his settlements staff to record fictitious trades in the accounting system. These fictitious trades were reversed at the opening of the market on the following day. The purpose was to reduce end-of-day open positions in Nikkei and JGB futures, in Barings accounting records, and consequently, in the SIMEX computer system. This practice effectively reduced margin calls from SIMEX.

Despite the manipulations of the books, the funds needed for SIMEX’s margin calls steadily increased. Leeson used a number of methods to convince Barings' management of the necessity to transfer large sums of money to Singapore, and it worked pretty darn well, I wish I had the same success when asking my grandma for more gambling money.

In addition to the funds transferred from London, Leeson sold options on the Nikkei index through Account 88888 from the start of 1993. From January 1994, the position in Nikkei options increased significantly when Leeson set up a large series of short straddle positions

**Positions in February 1995**

The total monthly trading volume through Account 88888 increased from 2051 in July 1992 to a peak of 96,121 in September 1994. In January 1995, the total was 90,000 contracts SR3.14 or about 7.5% of total trading volume. There had been a similar growth in the trading of JGB futures. By November 1994, the volume of JGB futures transacted through Account 88888 represented 24% of the total volume on SIMEX. The volume of Leeson’s unhedged JGB position in the 88888-account also increased, in particular during the 2 months leading up to Barings’ collapse. Eventually, his short position was over 28,000 contracts. Leeson started to trade Euroyen futures through the 88888-account in October 1993, but after that month, his transactions in this market were limited to certain short time intervals only. The eventual loss on these Euroyen positions was ‘only'£3 million BoE,

**Selling Straddles**

Let's say you're on RH and have used up all of the money you borrowed on FD's. That's quite a bummer, as you've just read an awful DD on a pre-revenue company and you'd love to buy some illiquid calls on this garbage stock. What can you do to get some funds?

The largest part of Barings’ losses came from a massive long position in Nikkei futures. Until October 1993, Leeson’s losses were always recovered. After that, losses increased gradually but accelerated in the final 2 months leading up to the collapse of Barings. During that final stage, Leeson expanded his long position in Nikkei futures to 49% of the open interest in the March 1995 contract and 24% in the June 1995 contract.

Leeson earned revenues to pay his margin calls by selling short straddles. A short straddle is a strategy a short put option and a short call option with the same strike prices are simultaneously combined. The only way a short straddle can earn profits is if the price of the underlying asset does not move substantially in either direction. A short straddle looks like a mountain or an iceberg, with most of its mass underwater (i.e., below zero). Notice how little of the straddle is above zero, compared to the total profit-and-loss profile. The portion of the short straddle that is above zero depends on the size of the premium relative to the total exposure.

&amp;#x200B;

**Combining a Short Straddle and a Long Futures Contract**

It is important to remember that the short straddle positions taken by Leeson did not occur in isolation. Leeson combined his short straddles with long futures positions. For every straddle he sold, Barings got cash, and Leeson used the cash to pay the required initial margin deposits on new trades and also to meet the mounting margin calls on his existing stock index futures positions.

That's like next-level stupid, I hope most of you understand that you shouldn't use the credit you get when selling naked options to take even more risk.

[Profit and Loss of One Long Futures + One Short Straddle](

As you can see, to profit from the long futures position, the stock price had to rise above the futures price, but if it rose too much, every yen of gain made on the futures position would be offset by losses on the short straddle (on the short call portion of the straddle). On the downside, the situation was much riskier. A decline in the stock price caused simultaneous losses on the futures position and the straddle position (the short put portion of the straddle, because when you buy a put you happy when stock go down, so when you sell put you sad when stock go down). The only thing standing in the way of losses at almost every price level was the premium that was collected upfront, at the time the straddle was sold shows the profit-and-loss profile created when the short straddle and a long futures position (see Exhibit 7.5) are combined. It is similar to a short put, except that the downward-sloping portion of the pro-file is even steeper than usual, because the long futures contract incurs losses as the underlying asset’s price falls below the futures price, and the short straddle incurs losses as the underlying asset’s price falls below the strike price. As you can well imagine, the combination of his short straddles and long futures made it more difficult, but certainly not impossible, for Barings to audit Leeson’s net exposures.

shows that the gains from a short put position are capped. By contrast, the potential losses could be enormous if the asset price (e.g., the Nikkei 225 index) fell

**Combining a Long Futures Position and Numerous Short Puts**

The profit-and-loss profile from combining a short straddle and a long futures position (see Exhibit 7.6) gives the illusion that Leeson had a viable trading strategy, and he just guessed wrong in terms of the price movement shows a large span of prices to the right of the strike price, which offers, at least, a glimmer of hope that profits could be earned. Unfortunately, we will find that this was not the case. In fact, Barings would have been lucky if Leeson had put the bank in such a position. The illusion is revealed once you realize that Leeson’s need for large sums of cash to fund his margin calls forced him to sell disproportionate numbers of short straddles for each long futures position he took. Exhibit 7.6 shows the results if one long futures contract is combined with one short straddle, but this one-for-one combination was not what Leeson did. Rather, he combined numerous short straddles with each long futures position.

&amp;#x200B;

This figure shows the profit-and-loss profile when numerous short straddles are combined with a long forward contract. The hybrid payoff profile looks, again, like an iceberg, because 90% or more is underwater. The only outcome that could have been even slightly profitable was if Japanese stock prices hovered at or near their current levels, in which case the stock index futures contracts would have generated small gains, and the put and call options would have expired out of the money. If stock prices rose too much, the gains on the futures contracts would have been overwhelmed by the losses on the mountain of short calls. If stock prices fell, the losses on the long futures would have been amplified by the losses on the mountain of short puts.

**The unavoidable happened**

By 31 December 1994, Leeson had accumulated losses of £208 million. Japanese stocks never rose above 19,000, there was an earthquake in Kobe on 17 January 1995, and Japan’s long-awaited recovery was pushed farther and farther into the future. He was left holding a massive bag.

After the earthquake, the Nikkei Index fell to 18,950, forcing Leeson to engage in an even more frantic and massive operation that looked, in retrospect, like a single-handed effort to hold Japanese stock prices at the 19,000 level. The dude tried to P&amp;D himself, quite successfully at the beginning, but that didn't last.

Over the next five trading days, Leeson bought a total of more than 20,000 futures contracts, and by 22 February 1995 his aggregate position was over 61,000 futures contracts. Despite his frantic buying, Japanese common stocks fell sharply, and on Monday, 23 January 1995, the Nikkei index fell 1,000 points to 17,950. For Leeson, theend was near. By February 1995, his losses had reached an astounding £830million.

As enormous as his losses were after the stunning drop in Japanese stock prices, Leeson’s strategy could still have worked if he had been able to buy enough contracts to pull the index back up above 19,000, and it was for this reason that Leeson continued to sell straddles. As Exhibit 7.8 shows, if Barings could have held on until December 1995, Leeson’s spectacular losses would have turned into gains, because the Nikkei 225 stock index prices rose by more than 5,000 from July until the end of the year. Leeson continued trying to raise Japanese stock prices through the last weeks of January 1995 and into February 1995, but the wave of selling was too great, and he was unsuccessful in his attempts. Yeah you heard it correctly, this mf was about to diamonds hand and make gains big enough to buy his employer. Imagine being able to buy RH with your gains.

[Buy High Sell Low](

Then Leeson went on vacation with his wife, they ended up fleeing Singapore on February 23, 1995. In the end, his losses accounted for £827 million (or $1.4 billion), twice Barings's available trading capital.

Leeson was arrested in Germany and, after a failed bailout attempt, Barings went bankrupt on February 26, 1995. He was sentenced to six and a half years in prison in Singapore. While he was in prison, Leeson wrote his book, ""Rogue Trader."" In 1999, Leeson's book was made into a film of the same name and starring Ewan McGregor and Anna Friel.

Up until the year 2008, Leeson held the record for the most losses due to unrestricted trades. In 2008, the French bank Société Générale announced that a rogue trader named Jerome Kerviel had lost more than seven billion dollars by conducting a series of unauthorized and false trades.

That's all good but what is the main takeaway we can get out of this horror story.

**Doubling and Managing Losses**

That managers take additional risks to escape from a threatening situation is a well-known theme in the field of managerial decision making. For example, it is known that people will take greater risks to escape losses than to secure gains. As a consequence, people’s behavior tends to change in unexpected and unattractive ways when they are confronted with increasing losses.

Thus in finance, the fear of falling is constantly in the background and sometimes can lure people into disastrous activities. Individuals can become gripped by a frantic panic and may try to conceal these losses or double up their bets like crazed gamblers trying to punt their way out of their mounting debts. This is the classic gambler’s fallacy.

In the case of Leeson, we clearly see a degenerate who seeks to become the master of the universe, managing to gain a reputation as a star performer. Leeson tried at all cost not to lose that image. When losses were mounting, he followed a strategy of continuously expanding his position. A quote from Leeson 1996 may illustrate our point:

*""I felt no elation at this success. I was determined to win back the losses. And as the spring wore on, I traded harder and harder, risking more and more. I was well down, but increasingly sure that my doubling up and doubling up would pay off . . . I redoubled my exposure. The risk was that the market could crumble down, but on this occasion, it carried on upwards . . . As the market soared in July 1993 my position translated from a £6 million loss back into glorious profit. I was so happy that night I didn’t think I’d ever go through that kind of tension again. I’d pulled back a large position simply by holding my nerve . . . but first thing on Monday morning I found that I had to use the 88888-account again. it became an addiction.""*

An important attribute of doubling strategies is that the inevitable and devastating loss is preceded by a period of high returns with low volatility. Conditional on the bad event not having happened yet, the doubler’s investment performance appears to indicate significant **investment skill.**

This to me is very similar to the feeling we get after taking a big loss in a position. We immediately want to go back and YOLO to recoup our losses. Don't do that.

Also, I’ll try to not sound like “David” in the following.

You. You are an individual. As an individual, you are a basic economic unit. As a basic economic unit, you are responsible for contributing economic activity, managing your personal resources, and maximizing utility. Utility means two things in being a productive member of society AND by being content with your lifestyle. This has been studied for generations and is taught as personal finance or even home economics.

As an individual or a family, it is in your best interest to ensure you have adequate liquidity. This liquidity will allow you to meet your short term financial obligations and even your long term financial obligations. Most people talk about an emergency find which should be 6 months to 1 year of your complete living expenses. For most adults in the U.S. this figure is a minimum of $30,000 per individual in cash, either physical or in a checking account that can be quickly accessed. Most of you probably do not have these resources available. If you do not, then you should immediately stop gambling and save every red cent.

At the time of this writing, the total value of the US stock market was approximately 100 Trillion USD...maybe more. However, the total circulating supply of USD in the world was approximately 20.4 Trillion USD. That means that 80% of the total stock market value is illusory and nonexistent. This is why during 2008 and 2020 there was such a run on financial markets. Everyone was cashing in to get raw cash! The problem then, and the problem now, is that there isn’t enough money to go around. When the next market meltdown happens, it will be far more pronounced as everyone tries to convert their funny money assets into real money. This is one of the reasons why there is such a growing disparity between the rich and the poor. The poor give their money to the rich and then wonder why they are poor. 

Anyway, everyone knows that stock prices are super overvalued, bond prices are super overvalued, real estate is super overvalued. The only thing that is not yet overvalued, is USD.



If you are less than 30 years old, you do not get to have an opinion on inflation or the value of the USD. You simply have not lived enough to know what the fuck you’re talking about. Period. All of the “precious” metal bugs are getting their shit pushed in by JPow’s green dildo. There is inflation, but it’s in every asset class from bond prices, stonk prices, and real estate prices…not in cash. Cash is the only thing with intrinsic value because that is what we all use as a medium of exchange. It’s also what each and every one of us care about at the end of the day. Period. Every other asset is only made up of extrinsic value nowadays which is why meme stocks have been in the the driver seat. Finally, the only way the USD will stop being of any value is if the United States collapses. If that happens, you will have bigger personal issues to deal with than literally ALL of your assets going to 0. Moving on.

Boomers hold most of the wealth in the United States. They also have most of their wealth tied up in the stock market and real estate market. Most boomers will be retiring en masse and as they do retire, they will be converting their mutual funds and stocks into cold hard cash. This will have a ripple effect that will make equity prices go down. While you’re stuffing real money into the slot machines of the stock market casino, boomers are gleefully taking that money from you and putting it in their pockets. The boomers didn’t take your money…you gave it to them. Further, as they begin retiring, and they have already begun, they will keep taking your money as they sell their shares to you.

&amp;#x200B;



Also, look at the velocity of money. The velocity of money has been in decline since the GFC and has dropped from 10.6 in 2008 all the way down to 1.18 in 2021. Shit is going to get crazy as the real economy is still fucked and there will be a reckoning soon. Soon means anywhere from a few weeks to a few years. Nobody has a crystal ball but anyone that looks around can see it. Make no mistake, it IS coming. Make sure you are properly positioned so you don’t get fucking rekt when it does. You recently saw how the market sold off over 1% last week at just the hint of the Fed talking about thinking about tapering asset purchases. That doesn’t even address the fed funds rate. Interest rates will have to go up soon. When they do, even by .25%, it will make EVERYTHING lose value. Burry was right when he called this the greatest speculative bubble of all time and that the market is dancing on a knife’s edge. Do not let yourself get fucked by the idiocy of those in power.

IDGAF what you think about this, because at the end of the day, YOU and YOU ALONE have to live with yourself and your personal circumstances. It’s no skin off my ass if I see you on a street corner begging for change. I’ve already met some of you who’ve YOLO’d it all right into homelessness. I warned you. If this saves one idiot from gambling their live savings away on this negative sum game, then that is enough for me.



Takeaways: sell all your shit now and convert it all into USD. Hold it in money market funds or your checking account. As long as you have quick access to it for use in your personal life. If you have dependents, then get the fuck off of WSB and get your family financially prepared. I’ve seen too many deadbeat dads on here who have financially ruined their families. Don’t be that guy. If you’re single, then make sure you don’t have to move back in with mom n’ dad. Take care of your shit.

Also, make sure your career is stable and unfuck yourself if you’re on a PIP or something. Find a new job because right now wages and salaries are higher and it’s a bull market for job seekers. Start a business or a side hustle, with bonus points if it targets boomers and their wealth.

Positions: 90% USD and 10% in brokerage account to gamble on OTM options. Most I can ever lose is 10% of my wealth. 

TLDR: Cash out your retirement, cash out your stonks, bonds, and everything. DUMP IT before Boomers do it first. Cash is still king and you will need the liquidity to personally weather the storm during the coming crisis. Only gamble 10% of your total net worth in risky stonks or options at any given time. DO NOT YOLO. Gambling on the stock market is fine as long as you’re using money that you can literally afford to lose. e.g. no more than 10% of your net worth at any given point\*.

\*Don’t use the 10% rule as an excuse to chop yourself up into bits before ending up broke. This means if you’re only worth $10,000 then the most you can gamble is $1,000. If you lose it, then you’re done until you save another $1,000 to then gamble. It does not mean lose $1,000, then take 10% of $9,000. Again, this is all on you.

182,post,pa1b06,2th52,wallstreetbets,False,2021-08-23 07:47:29,https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pa1b06/chinese_stocks_and_whats_happening/,self.wallstreetbets,,"**Disclaimer**: I have no positions in any Chinese stocks. I have refused to buy a single one since I got burned several years ago by a Chinese company cooking their books (not the coffee one). The point of this post is to inform.

I've been seeing a lot of comments about why is BABA/Chinese stocks drilling to the core of the earth or like comments. I've been doing a good amounting of reading (jk i can't read and a robot reads out loud to me). Below I tried to summarize sections and provide snippets of good info.

**Owning Shares of a Chinese company as a foreigner.**

**TL:DR** \- when you buy shares of a Chinese company on a american/european/hk/non-chinese exchange are buying shares of usually a Cayman shell company with some contractual rights to the Chinese company.

Below is a quote from a bloomberg opinion article that lays it out better.

&gt;With Chinese companies this sort of thing is generally called a  “variable interest entity.” You set up a company in the Cayman Islands  that can be owned by anyone. The Caymans company enters into a series of  contracts with the local Chinese company, giving it, not ownership, but  certain carefully curated economic interests and control rights over  the Chinese company. Then you list the Caymans company in the U.S., and  people buy its stock, and they sort of pretend that they’re buying stock  in the Chinese company — they sort of pretend that the Chinese company  is a *subsidiary* of the Caymans holding company — even though  really they’re only buying an empty shell that has certain contractual  relationships with the Chinese company. ^(1)

&amp;#x200B;

**What's happening now?**

**TL:DR -** The CCP revealed a 5 year plan^(2) on 8/11 essentially indicating they plan on cracking down on businesses for the next 5 years. We're just starting to see it with the fines and new laws dropping.

So whats happening now, and causing Chinese stocks to drill to the center of the earth? On 8/11 the CCP revealed a 5 year plan outlining their plans for tighter regulations on the Chinese economy. I can't read chinese hieroglyphs and google translate butchers it. So my best resource has been news articles. I'll be pulling alot from a BBC article as its been the best at outlining the current situation.

&gt;It said laws will be strengthened for ""important fields"" such as science and technological innovation, culture and education.  
&gt;  
&gt;The plan also said the Chinese government aims to tackle monopolies and ""foreign-related rule of law"".  
&gt;  
&gt;Regulations  relating to China's digital economy, including ""internet finance,  artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing etc."" will also be  reviewed.^(3)

The BBC articles goes out to outline recent actions by the CCP.

&gt;Beijing  has already launched anti-monopoly investigations into some of the  country's biggest technology firms and taken action against a wide range  of other businesses.  
&gt;  
&gt;In April, technology giant Alibaba accepted a record $2.8bn (£2bn) fine after an investigation found that it had abused its dominant market position for years.  
&gt;  
&gt;Last month, Tencent was told to end exclusive music licensing deals with record labels around the world.  
&gt;  
&gt;Also  in July, some of the country's biggest online platforms - Kuaishou,  Tencent's messaging tool QQ, Alibaba's Taobao and Weibo - were ordered  to remove inappropriate child-related content.  
&gt;  
&gt;This  week, Chinese authorities said they had increased their scrutiny of  after-school tuition services offered by individual teachers.  
&gt;  
&gt;...Last month, Beijing unveiled a massive overhaul of China's $120bn  private tutoring sector, under which all institutions offering tuition  on school curricula will be registered as non-profit organisations.

On 8/20 China passed a new personal data privacy law.^(4) Not necessarily bad, and similar in nature to Europe's GDPR. This is just another step in the CCP efforts to further regulate the economy.

&gt;The  law states that handling of personal information must have clear and  reasonable purpose and shall be limited to the ""minimum scope necessary  to achieve the goals of handling"" data.  
&gt;  
&gt;It  also lays out conditions for which companies can collect personal data,  including obtaining an individual's consent, as well as laying out  guidelines for ensuring data protection when data is transferred outside  the country.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  law further calls for handlers of personal information to designate an  individual in charge of personal information protection, and for  handlers to conduct periodic audits to ensure compliance with the law.

**Other risks**

This part will be have a good amount of FUD, but I still think should be shared. Back when DiDi was drilling this news came out.

&gt;Regulators in Beijing are planning rule changes that would allow them to  block a Chinese company from listing overseas even if the unit selling  shares is incorporated outside China, closing a loophole long-used by  the country’s technology giants, according to people familiar with the  matter.  
&gt;  
&gt;... the VIE framework  has never been formally endorsed by Beijing. It has nevertheless  enabled Chinese companies to sidestep restrictions on foreign investment  in sensitive sectors including the Internet industry. The structure  allows a Chinese firm to transfer profits to an offshore entity --  registered in places like the Cayman Islands or the British Virgin  Islands -- with shares that foreign investors can then own.  
&gt;  
&gt;While virtually every major Chinese internet company has used the  structure, it’s become increasingly worrisome for Beijing as it  tightens its grip on technology firms that have infiltrated every corner  of Chinese life and control reams of consumer data. Authorities so far  have little legal recourse to prevent sensitive overseas listings, as  with the recent Didi Global Inc. IPO, which went ahead despite requests for a delay from regulators.^(5)

In another article

&gt;In its brief statement on Tuesday, the State Council said rules for  overseas listings will be revised and publicly-traded firms will be held  accountable for keeping their data secure. It also said China will step  up its regulatory oversight of companies trading in offshore markets. ^(6)

This article was another interesting take on what could happen with some Chinese companies.

&gt;If China moves bring down Didi’s share price and it forces new investors  on the company, it would look a lot like the scenario that Jesse Fried,  a professor of law at Harvard University, laid out to ... early  last week. Basically, he sees the opportunity for China to drive down  the price of these companies before having rich Chinese investors take  them private at a lower price.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Chinese companies that list here often end up going private. The  people who control a company they plan to take private may release bad  news and withhold good news so the stock goes down, and then buy back  the firm’s stock at a very low price,” Fried said. “This happens not  only with Chinese go-privates, but also with American ones too. It won’t  happen with a company like Alibaba BABA, which is too big to take private, but it can happen with smaller companies.”     
&gt;  
&gt;One example he gave was Qihoo 360, which like most Chinese IPOs  was domiciled in the Cayman Islands with a structure that gave U.S.  shareholders no real voice. In late 2015, the company announced a deal  to be taken private by a group of investors led by its CEO Zhou Hongyi,  who had a 61% majority stake. The go-private deal valued Qihoo at about  $9.3 billion, but after it relisted in Shanghai, its shares soared to a  $56 billion valuation in 2017. Fried noted in this article in the Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance that Quihoo’s CEO made $12 billion alone in relisting the company. ^(7)

Some of you may remember me as a [triangles]( [lover]( [SPY 🌈🐻 doomer]( [Meminem - Degen creator]( or [the guy who got to CBS news]( for the AMC TA with an [inverted MC Hammer and a bull humping a bear]( Most importantly, I am the retard to make a GME bet a couple of months ago, where I would have [to shave my precious beard provided GME stonk shares don't reach thousands]( It's August already, GME is still in lower hundreds, and I feel obliged to make my next move. After several weeks of thoughtful consideration and research, I have finally made a decision to...

[Double down]( on my bet, like any decent retard residing in this cozy place would do.

But first things first, let's revise the original bet, [the underlying post and analysis](

(I’m not a financial advisor, just a retard who enjoys writing big texts and making risky bets)

&amp;#x200B;

# Chapter I. The short, the squeeze, and the ugly manipulation

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, so a couple(ish) of moths ago I handcrafted that TA thesis (on which the beard bet is based) for GME price action and its potential move to lower thousands as the short squeeze progresses:



The thesis above was not a generic 'you are here' type of posts you got used to seeing occasionally here and there through the last half a year. Rather, it was a fair attempt to critically assess the stonk's technical setup through the prism of the two most famous SS historical examples:

[VW](

[and TSLA](

[The OC post and analysis]( (which is still worth your reading, especially if you want to grasp this chapter of the post in greater detail) took me a lot of effort to produce, and I am still proud to have done this work, distilling the essential components of a short squeeze structure, and creating at least some sort of a framework to apply in cases like the current one. However, GME price during the summer did not follow the pattern, and particularly its most anticipated triangular 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' stage.

[by Pink Floyd is one of my favourite songs](

Does it render the whole thing void? Well, that's what I've been thinking in August while morally preparing myself for the beard apostasy. But something didn't quiet fit, and I kept digging. Just to stumble upon this:

[AMCSS, daily chart](

Looks familiar, doesn't it? Ladies and apemen, with a great pleasure I present you AMCSS, the timing of which is really similar to what I was betting my beard on in relation to GME. What happened to AMC during the summer actually proves almost every single point from my SS thesis. Firstly, the 'Purple Haze' level ($14.38) is the main resistance on the chart, and only when the breakout occurs, the SS unfolds. Secondly, 'Squeezy Grail' (the cup shaped consolidation) and the 'Runway' (rectangle) phases precede the squeeze impulse - that's where the buying pressure accumulates, to the point when it can no longer be suppressed. Next, interestingly enough, trend based Fibonacci periods grid allows to predict the peak date (vertical line marked as 1) extremely accurately, if the preliminary trend + the 'Squeezy Grail' phase are used as its core measurement (red dashed line). But wait, there's more! The 'Purple Haze' resistance is in between 1 and 0.786 Fibo levels (horizontal), while the retracement itself measures the amplitude of the SS impulse perfectly - e.g. take a look at how the price action retraces to 0.5 Fibo after the peak, or how the price consolidates in the channel of 0.236-0.382 after that. Well, the thesis fits almost perfectly to AMC - I hope you're now sitting like



There are several minor deviations from the SS frameworks which should be mentioned too, though: the PH breakout occurs during 0.618 Fibo period, rather than 0.382, as it was in historical examples; the triangular phase doesn't really resemble a triangle. Notwithstanding those minor factors, original SS thesis is more than alive with the AMC example.

You might be thinking now: what defuq is this crazy dude is talking about, where is the video of the beard shaved? Well, I'm providing the AMCSS analysis here in order to prove that my thesis is legitimate, and GME price action had to follow the pattern. GME and AMC are like brothers in arms, with 'similar' fundamentals, and through the major part of 2021 those two have been moving in tandem, strongly following linear correlation principle. The thesis structure (built upon TSLA and VW historical examples) indicates that there is the strong buying pressure accumulating, and in AMC example the lid was opened for a bit to let the steam out; while GME is still being suppressed even further during the current consolidation, and in my opinion - it is done artificially and purposely.

Furthermore, take a look at this:



What you see above is the screenshot from [my other post]( where I explained that two stonks had extremely similar technical setups: both have long-ass triangular consolidation at the core, which is subsequently broken out to the upside. Next, take a look at MACDs or TSIs from both examples, and particularly at what is highlighted by rectangles - zoom in and see for yourself, the structures are close to being identical. So, the question arises: why if two stocks have very similar fundamental and technical backgrounds, one is allowed to moon a little bit, while the other one is being knocked out each time right before the lift off should occur? The answer if fairly obvious, and it's because some big financial boys want things to go this way. AMC is something they can control, or maybe they even benefit from it’s price fluctuations. While GME is a Pandora box, and they try to keep its lid close for as long as possible, soothed by an illusion of a controllable chaos. And those suckers are ready to use any method to suppress the price, especially \*\*insert Aliens Guy meme here\*\*: manipulation.

Apes from a friendly sub uncovered many such methods, like good old FTDs, married puts, OTC trades, wash sales, darkpools... I'm not going to discuss those things in this post, because there is a plenty of outstanding DD on reddit. I'm just going to borrow this picture from u/AutoDrafter2020 because it speaks for itself, in my opinion:

[GME daily chart](

As you can see yourself, every major piece of fundamentally good news for GME has resulted in price suppression, and each of the dirty play instruments mentioned above played a role in this shitshow to one degree or another. The manipulation is so blatantly obvious that it makes me sick. Manipulating the market is not cheap, and probably costs fuckers on the other side of the trade millions, if not billions every month. Why would there be so much effort and resources put into the war over a ‘memestonk’? Is it so that they want some random noname reddit retard to lose his precious beard? The actual answer is shocking, and in my opinion it should be sought in two Greek letters, **σ (sigma)** and **β (beta**).

# Chapter II. How 1987 and 2008 are reincarnating into 2021

&amp;#x200B;

Pepperidge apes should remember that during one of the Gamestop congressional hearings Vlad 'the Stock Implaler' Tenev mentioned something about late January events falling into five-sigma category, which scientifically speaking corresponds to a p-value, or probability, of 3x10-7, or about 1 in 3.5 million. He also used such a hackneyed expression as a 'black swan' event. Quote from a [Bloomberg article](  


&gt;A “black swan” event — made famous by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in a best seller that parsed the role of randomness in finance and life — comes as a surprise, has great impact and later becomes rationalized away as easily explained or predicted. *Many things that appear to be black swans, however, aren’t unforeseeable and are merely classified as such to avoid responsibility for not spotting them ahead of time in the first place*. A “five-sigma event” is a statistical descriptor of something that occurs five standard deviations away from and on either side of the mean in a data set. It describes the odds of something happening, and in five-sigma territory the odds are long.

Categorizing January craze as five sigma is debatable to say the least, because Gamestop shares started to skyrocket and multiply in price long before late January, and it doesn't take a lot of wrinkles to understand that the volatility should likely increase further, requiring additional collateral and somewhat decent risk management. However, I'm not going to discuss Vlad's choice of sacrificing Robbinhood users (disabling buy button) in order to protect the solvency of Robbinhood customers (Citadel and co), because that has been done enough times already, and the North remembers. Rather, Robbinhood example and Vlad's interpretation are provided here as a vivid illustration of the fact which we all feel deep inside: there is just too much risk in the market, it is being too much fucking over-leveraged so that even a fucking retail stock broker may easily get margin-called in a matter of hours. It is especially hilarious, considering the fact that unsophisticated actions of buying and holding a particular stock is enough to fuck the system, making the entire house of cards fall apart. The problem is that when you dive deeper, 2008 seem to be a blessing.

For example, let's start from the easy difficulty, take a look at this chart:



One of the major indicators of how the leverage is utilized is FINRA's margin statistics from its members (who carry margin accounts for customers), which FINRA publishes every month. There are several points of interest for us on the chart above. The first and the most important one is that margin dept has tripled after previous major bottom in 2009, from about $300 billions to almost $900 bn in 2021. Furthermore, take a look at how MD reaches the peak of $500 bn both in 2000 and 2007, and it's sufficient to send S&amp;P into several years bear market with 50% retrace, as soon as the leveraging trend reverses. Currently, MD is on its way to trilly, the figure has almost doubled compared to 2000 and 2007. Sounds a bit GUHy, doesn't it? Also, looking at the margin debt before the .com bubble, 2007 financial crisis and Covid crash it can be seen that, each time, the margin contraction starts before the crash itself, making MD a leading indicator. And guess what? MD is down 4.3% in July, which is the first major decline in 15 months. Deleveraging is a painful process, but is necessary for markets’ health, and it seem to have already begun.

However, this time it is going to be so much fucking worse. To quote a brilliant mind, u/Criand:  


&gt;2008 never finished. It was can-kicked and the same people who caused the crash have still been running rampant doing the same bullshit in the derivatives market as that market continues to be unregulated. They're profiting off of short-term gains at the risk of killing their institutions and potentially the global economy.

I strongly recommend you reading his informative 2008 post in full, because it is a fascinating financial journey, through which you will learn a lot about how fuk the financial system really is right now, largely because of leverage. Imagine if r/WallStreetBets was a central bank. Fuck, this must be the most spot on metaphor I came up with in my entire life. Actually, it seems now that the entire financial world is one fucking giant WSB right now. And not in the good sense of its reputation.

To quote another brilliant mind, u/peruvian_bull, whose series of posts has been peer-reviewed by an economics professor:  


&gt;The entire derivatives market is HUGE. The BIS estimated the total notional value of the OTC derivatives market to be $640 Trillion in 2019! And that doesn't even include exchange-listed derivatives like most common option contracts. More sober estimates put it somewhere north of $1 Quadrillion. Numbers of this size are hard to wrap your head around - this is equivalent to a million billion, or a thousand trillion- for reference, the US economy is around $22 Trillion and the world economy is estimated to be $88 Trillion - thus the entire world economy could fit into the notional derivatives market 11x over and STILL not reach it. Every single bank is exposed, either directly or indirectly, to this market. For example, Deutsche Bank ALONE has over $47 Trillion in Notional gross exposure - TWICE the size of the entire US Economy!

[Wow](

*Intermediate TL;DR: the financial market is sufficiently levered according to its risk tolerance, and we all know what comes after that:*



This represents what Buffet called “A Time Bomb” in the market - as long as money flows in, the party continues. Once it stops, the Weapons of Financial Destruction are unleashed. As you may remember, something like that happened in 2008, when predatory lending targeting low-income homebuyers, excessive risk-taking by global financial institutions,

[And when I leverage like x1.5, I GUH straight away, so unfair!](

and the burst of the US housing bubble culminated in a perfect shitstorm. MBSs (Mortgage Backed Securities) tied to American real estate, as well as a vast web of linked to those MBSs CDOs, collapsed in value. As a result, financial institutions worldwide suffered severe damage, the GDP contracted sharply, the unemployment rates rose significantly, pushing millions of people into poverty - largely because some greedy bastards who had too much of financial power based on over-abused leverage and close to zero risk management made all the wrong decisions they could.

Thanks God, they promised not to do that again!

[The scene is from ‘Inside Job’ movie, a bright reminder of what’s going to happen again, soon.](

\*\*In Tyler’s voice\*\* So that was a fucking lie:

[Sauce: OCC's quarterly report on bank trading and derivaives, Q1 2021](

The figures above provide the relatively up-to-date exposure of the the biggest commercial banks towards derivatives. Although, we shouldn’t expect that those numbers allow to calculate somewhat precise leverage ratios, inasmuch as many of these derivative obligations net each other out, rendering the real value of the debt to be a bit more modest (or maybe not, who knows what’s really going on OTC). What is safe to assume, however, is that based on the numbers above, the leverage ratio is still in double digits at least for the biggest and most systemically important banks. From the recent infamous Archegos example, we saw that playing with leverage-amplifying synthetic market instruments (total return swaps in Bill Hwang’s case) is like playing with matches - and it will almost certainly lead to dire consequences at some point in time. Poor Bill just was the first one to run out of luck.

Another important factor to bear in mind, is that those professional financial ANALysts seem to follow a similar risks assessment approach that is used by an average WSB retard buying FDs. No, I’m not kidding, they literally stick to a bit more sophisticated version of a famous postulate: ‘Stonks only go up’. We are talking about VaR, or Value at Risk models. u/peruvian_bull managed to explain this complex stuff in a brilliant way in his series of posts dedicated to the highly probable upcoming financial market fiasco (fascinating reading - in this part of the series, 1987 famous crash is discussed and how derivatives and improper risks assessment exacerbated it):



&gt;Even to this day, Regulators, and indeed even financial industry insiders, are completely blind to the risk. OTC Derivatives are essentially unregulated - NO ONE knows the true size of this market. Worse yet, the traders inside the bank are using optimistic versions of the Efficient Market Hypothesis and VaR models to estimate their risk, which comes out to essentially 0 due to the risk models and net exposure hedging. Thus, they pile on more risk every day, ensuring that this problem continues to grow - until the entire system explodes.

  
No wonder, that in such a financial environment as described above, cases like GME would be given a five-sigma label. The best analogy to describe current financial market conditions would be a castle made of sand, when one sea wave of a higher magnitude can easily crash the whole thing into the dirt; or a house of cards, when just one stronger blow of the wind will trigger a chain reaction and demolish it to the fundament. The current status quo is not self-sustainable, and very soon it will become also a not FED-sustainable. The markets have been artificially supported by the money supply expansion for too long, currently resembling a drugs addict, who can’t live without the always following stimulus “dose”. As soon as liquidity dries up for a brief moment (sucked in by some negative beta bad boy), or the FED blinks... I guess, we’ll find out really soon what happens then.

To conclude and sum up the second chapter, quoting u/peruvian_bull again:

&gt;**As long as money keeps flowing into the Casino, the gamblers feel little risk, so no one pulls out. The Fed continues to print money, equity/bond prices continue to rise, and since there’s “no risk” of the underlying falling in value, everyone keeps their money in the pot, and the poker game continues.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The profits made from derivatives trading are enormous, and any bank that stopped doing this would quickly lose investors, because they would instantly take their capital out and take it to another bank that actually is profitable. It's all a confidence game - as long as everyone is confident, prices keep rising, and the cash keeps pumping in, the party will continue.**

# Chapter III. The Sword of Damocles (and the bet)

  
Well, here comes the party pooper, or it’s more appropriate to say, the party shitter:







Connecting the dots: when there is too much risk in the system, it becomes less and less sustainable, so that potentially even a short but sudden and intense surge in volatility may demolish the whole house of ~~leverage~~cards. Anything may cause a fatal error in such a system, even an old man’s fart with the sigma of five. In our example however, it’s when crazy retail jumps on the hype train, and buys over-shorted stonk like there’s no tomorrow, things look like this:

* GME shares added more than 500% in less than two days, showing off its negative beta in all glory,
* making VIX volatility index explode more than 60% in a day,
* and injuring SPY badly (sharp decline of about 4% in 21 hours).

That was just a preview.

Late January events are extraordinary, that’s for sure. But, you know, extraordinary things happen too, and it’s plainly stupid not to hedge in such circumstances, as Robbinhood did in this story. That was a vivid example of an extremely poor risk management, prevalent on the financial markets currently. This factor, coupled with the excessive margin exploitation (e.g. a fucking reported triple digits SI, dafuq?), will consequently result in the financial crisis, which is currently on its way (remember, crises love September and October).

After a rather fascinating set of circumstances, GME situation seems to have become the needle to burst the bubble, that’s why big financial boys use all of their dirty tricks, flirting with an illusion of a controllable chaos. However, any manipulation has its end, and it is a double edged sword (of Damocles). The market will punish the bad actors, as it has always done so in the past - and the good guys will be remunerated. Again, GME is not the reason of the upcoming market crash, but rather a trigger, and in the current financial environment anything could work as a substitute. What was that quote from the ‘Butterfly Effect’ movie? Oh,  


&gt;It has been said that something as insignificant as the gases emitted from an anus of an old man can ultimately cause a financial typhoon all around the world...

**Enough words and quotes. This is my bet: GME to thousands in a couple of months, while the new financial crisis unveiling, or I’m not only shaving off my beard (which I wasn’t really afraid of loosing, tbh, as it would grow back in a couple of months) but also this, my real treasure:**



**And here is why I’m so confident in my bet and its timing:**

[SPY daily chart](

I mean, SPY is cooked. What's outlined on the TA above is a massive bearish formation, ready to push the market off the cliff it has been climbing all this time. In my opinion, that's going to be just the first wave of the nasty downside movement, and a very sharp and painful one. Considering the longer term setup, explained [here]( and [here]( the technical (as well as fundamentals, as discussed above) conditions resemble the perfect storm brewing. Now, while it's all calm before that storm, enjoy the last sunny and warm days (and, maybe, it's a good idea to fix some profits, dunno). September and October will be fun. Especially for GME with its negative beta.

[VIX daily chart](

[GME daily chart, log scale](

**TL;DR: My SS thesis and its core idea is more than alive with GME (proven by AMC example), and even though any major price action movement has been suppressed in an attempt to keep things under control by big financial players, the buying pressure is there and it's as strong as it has ever been. The financial system is over-levereged, way more than it was in 2008, and coupled with the industry poor risk assessment standarts ('average WSB retard'-like or worse), it is heading to the next financial crisis (and crashes love autumn). This factor, considering GME's negative beta, will likely trigger the next powerful bull run for GME, sucking in the liquidity from the fearful and already-illiquid markets, resulting in colossal volatility typhoon. Either that, or I'mma be completely bold this winter.**","GME YOLO beard bet update.

The world of finance is absolutely filled with people making claims about what’s good or bad, how you should or shouldn’t do something, and what you can and can’t achieve. My goal is to take a look at these claims, spend some time researching them, and then share what I’ve found. I’m going to investigate various strategies, ratios, indicators, portfolios, and general market concepts with the goal of determining which ones are just noise and which ones might help you get ahead. 

In this write up I’m going to be taking a deep dive into another incredibly popular metric – the price to book ratio. I’m going to start with a walkthrough of how you calculate it, then I’m going to cover how it should be used, then I’m going to go over some of the pros and cons of it, and most importantly I’m going to see if it gives you any kind of advantage when selecting stocks. 

#**What is P/B?**
A company’s price to book ratio is the ratio between the company’s current share price and their current book value per share. Book value is essentially the value of a company from the perspective of an accountant. Accountants don’t care about future earnings or potential speculation. They look at the current value of the business by taking all of the company’s assets and subtracting all of the company’s liabilities. This is then divided by the number of shares to get the book value per share. Once you have that you simply divide the share price by the book value per share to get the price to book ratio. 

#**Real Application**
Now I’m going to walk you through a real example. Total assets and total liabilities can be incredibly complex numbers to try and calculate, thankfully every public company will already have these numbers listed on their balance sheet which can be found on any number of websites. I grabbed Ford’s values from Yahoo Finance for this example. 

To find their book value you will be taking their total assets, which are things the company owns that have value and subtracting their total liabilities, which are things the company owes or is obligated to pay, like debt, interest payments, or workers’ wages. This is then divided by the number of shares in existence. This gives Ford a book value per share of 7.91. This means that for every $13.61 share - Ford has $7.91 of “real” value. Now the last step is to divide the price per share by this number which results in a price to book value of 1.72. 

Now before I can go into depth on how to interpret this number I need to explain the different ways to classify assets. Assets come in two forms, tangible, and intangible. This is important to know because it explains why some industries have significantly higher average price to book values than others. Tangible assets are most commonly physical things like factories, land, or machinery. However, they also include two less intuitive items which are cash and investment vehicles like stocks or bonds. The thing that all of these have in common is they have a relatively easy to find real monetary value outside of the company.

The other category of assets are called intangible assets which are things that are not physical and only have a theorized value. This can include copyrights, brands, or research. These have value but it’s far harder to put a price tag on them. In the standard price to book calculation the two will be added together if the intangible assets are given on the balance sheet. Another reason I defined both is because you will sometimes see people use price to tangible book value which means they did not consider intangible assets in their calculation. 

#**How to use P/B**
We calculated Ford’s price to book ratio as 1.72. Now like most fundamental ratios this seemingly random number each company has means absolutely nothing without some context. There is no definitive line of what defines a good or bad number because companies can have vastly different amounts of tangible vs intangible assets - and intangible assets are incredibly difficult to price. As with all fundamental ratios, you should only be using them as one of many data points to get an idea of how the business stacks up against similar competitors.

For example, a consulting firm with a handful of employees and one small office building could generate as much profit as the steel mill on the other side of town. But because the steel mill has a lot more physical assets it’s going to naturally have a much lower price to book ratio. These companies are effectively equal but if you use price to book blindly you won’t see them that way. This means that in order to get the most out of a price to book comparison you want companies that are within the same sector and often even within the same industry.

To illustrate this point, I calculated the average price to book ratio of all of the sectors over the past few years. The technology sector which relies heavily on intangible assets has an average price to book of 7.3 which is the highest. One interesting thing I found was that even among sectors that are very physical in nature the value varies by *a lot*. Industrials have an average of 4.8 whereas the energy sector has an average of only 1.65. 

But what do these numbers actually mean? The price to book value compares the current valuation of the company, which includes future growth and speculation, to their current value, according to the balance sheet. A price to book of 1.72 means that the stock price is valuing Ford at 72% more than what their current accounting value is. At the very least, this means that large investors have an idea of how much they’d lose if the company went bankrupt and needed to be liquidated. This tie to real value is one reason why value investors prefer low price to book ratios, although as we saw when looking at the sectors, low is relative. 

Let’s continue with the ford example and see how it can be used in practice. Let’s compare their 1.72 price to book value to tesla, who is the largest of all up and coming electric vehicle makers. Tesla has a price to book of 26.95 which shows that their price is almost entirely speculative and is incredibly disconnected from their current real value. For reference, the average price to book ratio for the automotive industry is about 4. You can see how Ford and Tesla stack up here. This doesn’t necessarily say that tesla isn’t something to buy, but it does say that it is a growth stock that people expect *a lot* from in the future. If tesla is not able to reach the levels of growth speculated it will appear to be a disappointment to its investors and has a lot farther that it can fall before it reaches a more stable price when compared to something like Ford. If Tesla fails miserably and goes bankrupt the shareholder is unlikely to get back more than a tiny fraction of their money. If ford fails miserably and goes bankrupt a large shareholder could potentially get more than half of their investment back – though the process of bankruptcy and liquidation is large and complex with varying results. 

#**What are the pros and cons of P/B?**
Price to book is a complex ratio that has a lot of implications. I’m going to go over a few of the benefits and shortcomings of it. Let’s start with the positives. 
* Price to book can be used on companies that have negative earnings. New companies that aren’t yet profitable are very common and without a positive net income can be difficult to compare to companies that are profitable. Many companies that aren’t profitable are still great businesses as long as they are heading in the right direction. 
* Price to book also offers investors a look into how much of the stocks price is based on real value and how much is based on speculation. This it is incredibly effective at separating growth from value stocks – so much so that the Russell indices use price to book for half of their decision weight when creating their value ETFs. 
Now let’s look at some of the potential downsides. 
* Price to book does not give any indication of how well a company is using its assets, only that it has them. If you have two companies that both have one million dollars’ worth of machinery and the same price to book ratio, you have no idea which one of those is actually making more money. This emphasizes the idea that you always need to look at a variety of  factors when trying to find good value companies. 
* Another downside is that it also struggles to incorporate intangible assets because they are often incredibly difficult to value. This makes comparisons between more physical and less physical companies nearly useless with this metric. 
* Lastly price to book value can vary from company to company because it relies on how that company does their accounting. This effect is even more pronounced if you try to compare companies from different countries. 

#**Does P/B give you any advantage?**
Now, can price to book value help you outperform the market by identifying undervalued stocks? It depends. The first thing it depends on is what type of company you are looking at. Price to book works far better on businesses that are physically intensive because the land, machinery, and factories all have significant real value. It also works well with banks and other financial institutions because cash, stocks, and bonds are all also considered tangible assets due to their easily identified real value. It does not work well when you are looking at intangible industries. Software companies, consulting firms, and pharmaceutical companies are all examples of highly intangible areas of business. 

So, if you are looking to compare tangible companies from a similar industry - price to book has historically been a fantastic predictor of value. The paper called “value vs glamor: a global phenomenon” goes into incredible depth regarding the performance of price to book value. From 1968 to 2008 the 10% companies with the lowest price to book value outperformed the highest 10% by an average of 9.3% annually. This is a massive amount and with this it is pretty clear why many index ETFs use price to book to build their value ETFs. 

However, it’s not all great news. The paper titled “price to book’s growing blind spot” which covers up until 2016, shows that the price to book ratio has been losing its edge in the last decade to the point where it has almost no benefit. This is a completely true phenomenon, but I want to explain why it may be misleading. 

The last 10 years have been a part of the strongest bull market in history and this market is being led by primarily technology stocks. If you recall, technology stocks are mostly intangible and therefore are not able to be judged accurately with this metric. It is up to you whether you think this trend will continue. If you do, price to book may not be a metric you want to use. However, if you are looking at the long term and expect the market to return to more historically average conditions then it is likely still an effective measure of finding value. 

#**Conclusion**
The price to book ratio has certainly earned its fame, at least historically. Aside from the past 15 years the price to book ratio has selected strong value stocks again and again. It’s up to you whether you want to bet for or against the current paradigm of the market which is dominated by intangible technology. This will determine whether or not you should make price to book one of your tools. 

###**TLDR:**
Historically P/B has been one of the best predictors of value. This trend has nearly completely disappeared in the past 10-20 years. This is likely due to the dominance of tech companies which are incredibly heavy on intangible assets. Ideally it should only be used as one of many data points when selecting a stock and should only be used to compare similar companies in similar industries. 

###**Mild subreddit self-promotion:**
If you enjoy these kinds of posts I created my own subreddit r/FinancialAnalysis where myself, and eventually others, will be doing this style of research.

This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe’s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.

This morning, Paysafe also announced a deal with Glory, to ""improve access to the digital economy  for the estimated 2 billion people globally who remain unbanked""

Last week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%.  But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech.

Why did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : “Paysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.”

To be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion.  They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs \~ $105 billion)

So why the miss?  Analysts’ modeling assumed that 2021’s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation.

The company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%.  With half the volume short, real sellers are drying up. Seems buyers are patiently waiting for short sellers to exhaust themselves. With only 3 million shares left available to short, this could come any moment.

Gaps like that typically get filled if there’s no material negative news.  On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news:

&amp;#x200B;

* Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion
* Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA
* Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million
* Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus.
* 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter)
* 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture)
* 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV)
* Revenue growth in all segments
* eCash revenue +37% YoY  (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries)
* North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY
* Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits)
* Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance
* Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs
* Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage.
* Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring &amp; E-commerce

&amp;#x200B;

Further, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, “Paysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world’s fastest-growing online markets.”  Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America’s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar’s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.)

With their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America.

Importantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe’s current projections don’t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost.  Management noted, “These transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units…The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.”

This quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV.  Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1.

Chairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, “We see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.”

These new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley’s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&amp;A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.”

&amp;#x200B;

Yet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts’ neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality.  In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance.  Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted.

&amp;#x200B;

Paysafe vs PayPal

Seemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a ""free cash flow machine.""  The author apparently didn’t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal.

In fact, if you applied PayPal’s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe’s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow,  Paysafe’s share price would be $32.  A 4x gain from current levels.

&amp;#x200B;

Comparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider:

1. PayPal’s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.)  On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY.  With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe.  Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe’s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news.
2. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk “buy now/pay later” business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces.
3. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe’s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth.
4. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe’s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR).
5. PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal’s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe’s EPS is expected to grow 425%.
6. Based on Paysafe’s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60
7. Based on Paysafe’s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal’s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe’s share price at $28.40.
8. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt).  During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR.

* By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR.
* Paysafe hasn’t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe’s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal’s share value growth of 460%.

There are obviously many different factors to consider so I’m not making any claims about fair value here. It’s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe’s share price between $28 and $32.

This is not investment advice. Just a collection of observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.

Good MORNING everyone and thank you so much for taking a time out to read my post. I wanted to shine a little light on Gohealth symbol GOCO. They operate an online health marketplace. They are actually one of the leaders in this field. The growth online to do insurance has been extraordinary as seen with the company’s growth. This past quarter sales were up 55% year over year. I have traded GOCO by the way around 10-11 in the past. I still believe the stock is worth 11-12 but at the moment the negative sentiment will over take everything. This market unlike no other wants instant gratification, so you have extreme movements up and down. Let us first look at some highlights from the report.

· Second quarter 2021 net revenue of $196.9 million increased 55% compared to the prior year period. YTD 2021 net revenue of $401.1 million increased 50% compared to the prior year period.

· Second quarter 2021 Medicare—Internal revenue of $160.4 million increased 84% compared to the prior year period. YTD 2021 Medicare—Internal revenue of $317.8 million increased 74% compared to the prior year period.

· Second quarter 2021 Medicare Advantage (""MA"") Approved Submissions of 152,749 increased 58% compared to the prior year period. YTD 2021 MA Approved Submissions of 323,876 increased 52% compared to the prior year period.

· Second quarter 2021 MA LTV Per Approved Submission of $953 increased 5% compared to the prior year period. YTD 2021 MA LTV Per Approved Submission of $975 increased 11% compared to the prior year period.

· Second quarter 2021 net loss of $39.2 million compared to a net loss of $22.9 million in the prior year period; Adjusted EBITDA1 of $14.3 million decreased 47% compared to the prior year period due to the 2021 strategic investments in agent capacity, marketplace technology, branding and the Encompass Platform. YTD 2021 net loss was $46.4 million compared to a net loss of $23.8 million in the prior year period; Adjusted EBITDA1 of $46.4 million decreased 25% compared to the prior year period.

· The Company tightened its full year 2021 revenue outlook to $1,200 - $1,300 million (+37% to +48%) powered by commission net revenue of $1,000 - $1,100 million (+49% to +64%) as agent growth is tracking at the high end of expectations. The Company lowered its Adjusted EBITDA1 outlook to $300 - $330 million (+11% to +22%), primarily due to higher agent costs expected in 2021.

Now, because of the losses and as the CEO has said most of this cost is going to be attributed to the cost of labor, as they have retained more staff and increased bonuses to retain customers, this indeed will be a strike on margins, however one must ask themselves since growth is there and there was a slight miss

Bottom line if this drop was warranted.

Also note the CEO who gets stock options/warrants for free, did not want to wait for options that may take 3-6 months to exercise he went into the market and bought 1.5 million worth of shares. 253,000 shares @ 4.68.. The initial reaction the next day could be expected. It ran to 5.41, I do not know how it fell back Friday. So you are aware the CEO is not a billionaire. He gets a 325,000 salary and with his bonuses and options he gets about 4 million per year. Clint has been at GOCO since 2001!

Also please note the form 4s, other insiders are buying since the drop, also around the same price. They are buying because they do not believe the stock can be bought cheaper than this, otherwise they would wait for options and warrants! The strongest conviction for me is when insiders buy. A company can announce a buyback, and that is fine and dandy, that is cash the company makes, but when 3-10 board members buy at the open market and use their own cash!!!??? I love it!

I will also be the first to say that earnings report was not good, however it was slightly bad, wasn’t absolutely atrocious. A 60% drop is as if the company is going out of business. So you have to ask yourself in 3 – 6 months if the company keeps growing sales and they said they will have 1.2-1..3 billion in sales for the year, should drop this much? Please share thoughts and ideas..",GOCO.. WERE THINGS THAT BAD? 65% DOWN. 55% GROWTH.. SALES BEAT.. DOES MISSING BY 12 CENT JUSTIFY A 2 BILL MARKET CAP LOSS?,19,7

UPDATE 1-U.S. FDA aims to give full approval to Pfizer vaccine on Monday - NYT

Fri, August 20, 2021, 5:43 PM

WASHINGTON, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is aiming to give full approval to Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine on Monday, the New York Times reported [

on Friday.

Regulators were aiming to complete the process by Friday, but were still working through ""a substantial amount of paperwork and negotiation with the company,"" the Times said, citing people familiar with the planning who were not authorized to speak publicly about it.

The agency declined to comment.

It had set an unofficial deadline for approval of around Labor Day on Sept. 6, the report said.

The vaccine was authorized for emergency use in December and more than 203 million people in the United States have so far received it. But none of the three authorized COVID-19 vaccines have received full FDA approval.

The approval could give the vaccination campaign a boost by convincing more unvaccinated Americans that Pfizer's shot is safe and effective and also make local officials more comfortable in implementing vaccine mandates.

Vaccine hesitancy has been a major hurdle to the White House's goal of getting all eligible Americans vaccinated against the novel coronavirus.

Pfizer and U.S. listed shares of partner BioNTech SE were up more than 1% in extended trading. (Reporting by Katanga Johnson, Michael Erman and Manojna Maddipatla; Editing by Tim Ahmann and Arun Koyyur)",FDA aims to give full approval to Pfizer vaccine on Monday - NYT,63,1

I'm not sure how many of you are active in the bang community, but this is a pretty big deal. One of the cheapest and most common kinds of ammunition you can find is Tul-Ammo, a Russian import. Also common are Brown Bear, Wolf, Century, Barnstaul, and Red Army, all Russian, except for Red Army which imports into the US from other eastern European nations as well as from Russia. This article does a pretty good job at giving some perspective on the scope of the ban:



American ammo manufacturers can already sell faster than they can produce, and this past year, I've even seen ammo being re-sold with a markup, like some kind of redneck cryptocurrency. Some of the largest ammo manufacturers in the US include: Remington, Federal, American Eagle, Barnes, CCI / Blazer Brass (all of these are owned by parent company $VSTO), Winchester ($OLN), Black Hills ($POWW). 

TLDR: the American ammo supply is getting sharply reduced due to an import ban. After-hours data doesn't indicate much movement for any of the companies that will remain, but I can't see how they wouldn't profit massively from the ban, especially Vista Outdoors. I don't currently have any positions in any of the companies discussed, but am strongly considering it.",Biden Administration to Ban Imported Russian Ammo,180,4

For the retards lucky enough to have [gotten some calls early on $PFE]( this week could be the biggest one yet. I see this playing out one of three ways...

&amp;#x200B;

***Outcome #1:*** *FDA approval doesn't get announced until after hours, thus giving $PFE plenty of time to rocket up from the FOMO and greedy bears covering from last week. This is the best outcome for call holders IMO, and I could see a jump to $54 before close being doable. If you have any calls expiring before October, now would be the time to scalp profits on most of them IMO. (Warning: FDA approval could happen later in the week, thus increasing FOMO and sending this higher even after Monday.)*

***Outcome #2:*** *FDA approval is announced pre-market and profit takers head for the exits on market open. This is the worst case outcome for short-term call holders IMO as I would expect a blip of a rip and then significant dip upon market open. HOWEVER, longer term options towards October and on-wards  should be fine as I see this stock continuing to go up as Pfizer garners a bit of a monopoly being the only FDA approved drug in sync with the increasing vaccine mandates one must obey in order to even minimally function in public society.*

***Outcome #3:*** *Doomsday. It's not what you know that gets you, it's what you think you know that just ain't so. Everyone is betting on Pfizer FDA approval, and as almost certain as approval seems, the slightly less retarded degenerate should consider the possibility of a delay or even outright rejection of that approval. If that happens and you're still holding calls...it's time to get religious quick.*

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I'm fairly bullish for Monday. I think bears got caught with their pants down thinking FDA approval would only come in September, and the ""it's priced in"" crowd seem to be being proven wrong by the jump to +$50 during last Friday's after-hours. MM's have their eye on this, and therefore some sea-shell games might be played, but the mixture of FOMO, covering, and un-realized benefits FDA approval will give Pfizer has me so locked-in that I'm not sure if this brown tsunami I'm unleashing is due to a salmonella chalupa or pure excitement.

-	Safe Haven – An asset that provides safety from risk
  - Risk is exposure to bad contingencies. Most of these will never happen, but they can and they can appear in any number of forms
    - Investment risk is the potential for loss, and the scope of that loss
      - A Safe haven asset is an investment that mitigates that risk to preserve and protect your capital. They are shelters from financial storms
-	Safe haven investing is both a defensive measure to avert future loss and an offensive one to exploit future opportunities with &amp;quot;dry powder&amp;quot;.
-	A risk mitigation strategy must be cost effective. Anyone can develop a strategy that does well in a down market, but we must not have a cure that is worse than the disease
-	Benjamin Graham – &amp;quot;The essence of investment management is the management of risks, not the management of returns.&amp;quot;
-	Do not attempt what Spitznagel does as a retail investor or even professional.
-	Everett Klipp - &amp;quot;A small loss is a good loss.&amp;quot; Risk mitigation and survival are everything in investing. Don&amp;#39;t try to predict
-	Investing needn&amp;#39;t be about making grandiose forecasts. No one has a crystal ball
-	A cost-effective safe haven doesn&amp;#39;t just slash risk, it actually lets you take more risk in other parts of the portfolio
-	Aristotle pointed out that, while it is easy to make a couple lucky rolls of a die, with 10,000 repeated rolls, the &amp;quot;luck&amp;quot; of the die evens out
-	When your sample size is small, and even worse, unique and unrepeatable, no matter your subjective probabilities, there is so much noise in sample you can hardly know anything. You are hoping for good luck. Your Number (N) is 1
-	But if your success or failure relying on many outcomes, over many rolls of the dice. Your Number (N) is large. You are acting as the &amp;quot;House&amp;quot; exploiting the house edge through repetition to quash randomness. The house doesn&amp;#39;t gamble. We are as Poker theorist David Sklansky said, &amp;quot;at war with luck.&amp;quot;
-	Cost-effective risk mitigation or raising our compound growth rates (CAGR) and thus wealth through lower risk is really our comprehensive goal as investors.
-	Golden Theorem – As you accumulate more and more data in a random sample, you should expect the sample&amp;#39;s average to converge to the true average.
  - The more you roll a fair 6-sided die, the more the percentage of all those rolls in which you see any particular number will converge toward 1/6 or 16.66%
-	It isn&amp;#39;t just the single wager that matters, it is the iterative, multiplicative impact of that result on the next wager, and on the next! A large loss disproportionately lowers our geometric average return, because it leaves us with a much lower stake, or capital base to reinvest and compound on the next wager.
-	We cannot only judge our decisions by their outcomes. As good decisions can have bad outcomes. But we only get 1 outcome.
-	We have just one life (N=1), but our fate is a range of outcomes.
-	The most intuitive way for us to think about the meaning of the expected geometric average return and, equivalently, the geometric average ending wealth outcome under multiplicative growth is simply as the expected median ending wealth outcome
-	The geometric average return, rather than the arithmetic average return is close to what you should expect from random samples from all possible ending outcomes
-	By giving all the weight to this path(N=1), we essentially need to have gotten pretty much every possible path right. We must be robust to the realized path or &amp;quot;covered all the bases.&amp;quot; We don&amp;#39;t know what &amp;quot;path&amp;quot; we are going to get
-	Not all losses and not all risks are created equal, so not all risk mitigation is created equal
-	We need a risk-mitigation strategy that makes our returns both more accurate and more precise to win the bloody &amp;quot;war with luck.&amp;quot; We want a tighter grouping of our expected return or a reduced variance.
-	You have 2 options for achieving this. The store of value method or the insurance method. These 2 strategies can be very different in their cost-effectiveness
-	What makes something a safe haven vs a non-safe haven?
  - How does it do during a Crash? +/-
  - How does it do during normal times? +/-
  - What is the expected payoff during a crash and how does it achieve it?
-	You have 3 different types of safe havens.
  - Store of Value – Fixed in time and space. Key is low to no correlation. It provides both a cushion and &amp;quot;dry powder&amp;quot; should a crash take place. It is basically a matter of diluting risk. Crash return is +/0, Non-Crash Return is +/-, and Payoff type is low correlation
  - Alpha – Is like store of value, but its correlation is now expected to be negative. That means during a crash, it is expected to generate a positive return. Think of the flight to quality we see during a crash. Crash return is +, non-Crash return is +/-, Payoff type is negative correlation
  - Insurance – What Mark Spitznagel does, don&amp;#39;t try. Extreme version of the Alpha payoff. Needs to make a very large profit during a crash, relative to its expected losses the rest of the time. Needs to be highly convex to crashes or have an explosive payoff to justify its costs. Crash return is ++++, non-Crash return is -, Payoff type is &amp;quot;Convexity&amp;quot;
-	Safe Havens can be exceedingly costly, so much so that, as a cure, they can be worse than the disease.
-	Some safe havens require a very large asset allocation within the portfolio. The problem is large AA comes at a very large cost (drag) when times are good (which is most of the time). Gold has this problem.
-	Strategic vs Tactical Safe Haven
  - Strategic – Mitigates systemic risks in a more fixed way and letting it play out
  - Tactical – Requires moving into and out of safe havens. This requires timing and short-term forecasting skill (which people don&amp;#39;t have)
-	The problem is no one possess a &amp;quot;crystal ball&amp;quot; to know when to do this.
  - If you risk-mitigation strategy requires a crystal ball to work, then you are doing it all wrong. Don&amp;#39;t try to predict the market. Cost effective safe haven investing needs to be agnostic investing
-	Cassandras typically and ironically lose more in their safety from looming crashes than those crashes would have even harmed them.
-	Markets scare us more than they harm us
-	Markets are very, very good at making us feel safe when we shouldn&amp;#39;t and scared when we needn&amp;#39;t
-	Risk mitigation therefore needs to be a sustained way of life or habit, not a transient one
-	Imposter Safe Havens
  - Hopeful
  - Unsafe
  - Diworsification (Diversification)
-	Hopeful – Payoff is very unreliable. Requires a lot of luck to pay off in a crash. Sometimes requires good timing. It is like jumping out of an airplane with a parachute that only sometimes deploys, you are better off not wearing one in the first place and making a more informed decision. Crash return is (don&amp;#39;t know??), non-Crash return is +/- and the Payoff type is &amp;quot;Fingers Crossed&amp;quot;
-	Unsafe – This asset or strategy has so far always gone up, so it likely has a good story for why that should always be the case. This logic is then extended to their performance in a crash. They are often vulnerable in a crash, perhaps they have even shown some evidence of that vulnerability, but this doesn&amp;#39;t change the optimism around their safe haven status. It is like jumping out of an airplane and thinking you can fly. Crash return is -, non-Crash return is +, and payoff type is &amp;quot;Always goes up so it must be safe&amp;quot;
-	Diworsifier – Most common form you see in modern finance. It is pervasive throughout almost all investment portfolios. Diversification is fundamentally a dilution of risk, not a solution to risk. It is about evading risk. Diversification never tends to be as great (lower correlations) as it appears. When the investing herd heads for the exits in a crisis, most strategies and assets tend to get swept away. Strategies that were once uncorrelated, stable and liquid become the opposite of all those things as investors are forced to sell what they are able to, all at the same time. Diversification is &amp;quot;NOT A FREE LUNCH&amp;quot; as mentioned in modern finance theory. Crash return is -, non-Crash return is +, Payoff type is &amp;quot;Loses less, so it is worth it&amp;quot;
-	Diversification lowers returns in the name of higher Sharpe ratios, some investors who use this strategy but aren&amp;#39;t content with the lower returns are then forced to apply leverage in hopes of raising them back up. True risk mitigation should not require financial engineering and leverage in order to both lower risk and raise CAGR. Doing so adds a different kind of risk by magnifying the portfolio&amp;#39;s sensitivity to errors in those correlation estimates.
-	Aristotle – &amp;quot;The whole is not the same as the sum of its parts.&amp;quot;
  - This is true in finance. You can move a portion of your portfolio to an asset with zero expected return and away from an asset with a high expected return and raise the whole of your wealth, even though it lowered your average. All of this is due to compounding. Key Point of Book!!!
-	The properties emerge from the interactions of those component assets as they are rebalanced and compounded. Safe Havens adding so much ending wealth to the portfolio (geometric return) is due to the iterative nature of the game. They provide capital for the next &amp;quot;dice roll&amp;quot; by resetting or rebalancing the size of the wager at the end of each &amp;quot;dice roll&amp;quot;. Safe havens can thus top up or feed the wagers in the main game (large part of portfolio), particularly if the previous roll resulted in a big loss, without costing the frequent positive wagers enough to matter. The assets now interact, rather than act independently. Thus, an entirely new whole is formed, one that is very different from the sum of its parts.
-	If we only look at the way that things happened and obsess over it as the only likely outcome, then we are engaged in naïve empiricism. IE - we over-extrapolate the past
-	To avoid that we need to look at the past in the context of the many other paths that COULD HAVE happened, but never did, as well as our sensitivities to those outcomes
-	Most investors add a risk-mitigation strategy for its effect, but don&amp;#39;t properly account for the cost paid to gain that effect and thus don&amp;#39;t account for the net portfolio effect
-	There is always this risk-mitigation tension or tradeoff between the two contrary forces of cost and effectiveness (IE – arithmetic costs and geometric return). That tradeoff is between lower arithmetic returns (costs) as payment for the geometric pickup (effect). There is NO FREE LUNCH!!! But if can tilt that tradeoff in your favor, with an effect that outpaces the costs resulting in a positive net portfolio effect, then risk mitigation on net raises compounding and consequently, wealth. This is cost effective risk mitigation.
-	Remember, anyone can develop an asset or strategy that does well in a crash, the trick though is to do it while also raising the median return. Most risk mitigation strategies fail this portion
-	We cannot judge the cost effectiveness of a given risk mitigation strategy on its own, in a vacuum, based solely on its attributes.
-	The bigger the crash bang for the buck, the less that is needed and the less its potential drag or cost when it isn&amp;#39;t needed.
-	Mechanical vs Statistical payoff
  - Mechanical – is one that happens as a direct, intrinsic consequence. IE – an option going into the money from out of the money. It must go up in value.
  - Statistical – is one that only tends to be so, based on observed history, but it needn&amp;#39;t be so. It is more extrinsic and thus noisier. This would be like a flight to quality or safety that we see during a crash
-	You also have other possibilities for payoff warping, like counterparty risk (or the risk of not getting paid). Gold bullion has no counter park risk.
-	The question to ask yourself is do you need a lot of things to go right for a safe-haven to be effective? Is their history a good guide to their future, or is everything always different?
-	An ideal safe-haven is more mechanical but real-world payoffs tend to be much less so. They tend to fall somewhere on a spectrum between mechanical and statical.
-	Not Safe Havens
  - VIX futures – Volatility index but they are always in contango which causes them to have a very steep &amp;quot;roll&amp;quot; making them a really bad trade
  - High-Dividend Stocks
  - Hedge Funds
  - Fine Art
  - US Farmland
-	Only 2 safe havens are worthy of that name – Gold and Equity Tail Hedge
-	Store of Value
  - Cash (3-Month Treasury Bill) – Less interest rate risks than longer dated maturities. Not a safe haven
  - 10-20 Year Bonds (Typical of &amp;quot;Balanced&amp;quot; portfolio) – More interest rate risks vs shorter maturities (as of 2021 those rates are extremely low which hurts their current safe haven status), classic flight to safety asset when things turn bad for the stock market and the economy. They are a hopeful haven or a Diworsification
-	Alpha
  - CTA (Commodity Trading Advisors) – Active managed strategies (usually hedge funds) and trend following strategies. Attempt to capture Alpha by using momentum. Other derivatives-based strategies use similar strategies like long volatility and generic tail hedging. Not a safe haven
-	Insurance
  - Gold – Hedge against the banking system. No counter party risk. Historically thought of as a hedge against inflation. But, is a very noisy hedge against inflation. It is mostly tied to movements in real interest rates (When inflation goes up faster than nominal interest rates, real rates go down, pushing up gold prices). Mildly explosive crash (market down 15%) payoff on average (30% in the 1970&amp;#39;s and 7% since) but, it has had a very wide range of returns since the 1970&amp;#39;s. Gold is all about investors&amp;#39; expectations of value, it has no yield and has no intrinsic value. It is for that reason impossible to fundamentally value. Its payoff profile is largely statistical as expected. During the 1970&amp;#39;s, golds payoff profile made it very cost effective as a safe haven, outside of that, gold has been much less cost effective. Gold has required a tactical call regarding inflation or real interest rates in order to be a cost-effective safe haven. This means we need certain things to go right for gold to be an effective safe haven in mitigating systemic risk (of a crash), much less cost-effective. The amount of gold needed to fully hedge our portfolio is very high adding to its carry costs.",Safe Haven by Mark Spitznagel Book Summary Part 1,3,2

The world of finance is absolutely filled with people making claims about what’s good or bad, how you should or shouldn’t do something, and what you can and can’t achieve. My goal is to take a look at these claims, spend some time researching them, and then share what I’ve found. I’m going to investigate various strategies, ratios, indicators, portfolios, and general market concepts with the goal of determining which ones are just noise and which ones might help you get ahead. 


This is the first in a series I’m calling Ratio Review where I will be taking a deep dive into various popular fundamental metrics such as price to earnings, price to book, and return on assets. I will start by giving a brief description of how you calculate the metric, followed by how it is typically used, followed by how it should be used, and most importantly, if it gives you any kind of advantage when selecting stocks. Let’s kick this off by talking about arguably the most popular fundamental ratio out there – price to earnings. 


#**What is P/E?**
Let’s say a company’s stock costs 10 dollars, that there are 100 shares in existence, and that the company earned a total profit of 50 dollars this year. The price to earnings ratio, or P/E ratio, is calculated by dividing the current share price by a company’s earnings per share. Well, what is earnings per share you now ask. Earnings per share is calculated by taking a company’s profit and dividing it evenly amongst all shares. The earnings, when divided by the number of shares, results in 50 cents of profit a piece. Now to calculate the P/E ratio you simply divide the price by this number, which is 10 divided by 0.5, which results in a P/E of 20. 


So, is 20 good? Bad? It’s complicated!


#**Is P/E useful?**
If you’ve ever looked at any article, video, or strangers comment on the internet that’s talking about the price to earnings ratio you will almost always hear the same thing. BUY when the P/E is low, AVOID when P/E is high. This is by far the most common discourse and unfortunately is a great oversimplification. 


Some sources you’ll see will take this one step further to say that you should buy stocks with a low price to earnings ratios within their own sector, because different sectors have naturally different average P/E ratios. For example, the financial sector currently has an average P/E of about 23 whereas the technology sector currently has an average of about 37. This is a big step up from the last piece of mediocre advice, but it is still missing a relatively important detail.


Let’s take a step back and look at what a P/E ratio is describing. When you read the fraction it’s “price to earnings ratio” but you could say that it’s a “price for earnings” instead. You’re essentially buying the company’s current and future earnings. In our example above the stock had a P/E of 20 which means it would take 20 years of earnings at the current rate to get your money back. Just to make sure this is clear the earnings per share amount isn’t actually paid back, it’s not a dividend, it’s simply the company’s profit which is most likely going to be reinvested into the company which should raise the price of the shares.


With the idea in mind that you’re buying the company’s earnings it might make sense why it’s hard to compare a new fast growing company with an old giant one. The share prices are factoring in different things. The company that is expected to grow has more uncertainty but also potentially more room to exceed expectations. The other is less concerned with growing and more concerned with maintaining its current market position which often includes its dividend payouts. The P/E ratios of these companies will reflect these differences with faster growing companies having much higher ones. This is why you shouldn’t blindly use P/E even within the same sector. You are far more likely to end up with mostly older companies with less room to grow. These companies may be safe picks, but it is unlikely they will outperform a portfolio with a mixture of new and old companies.  


#**Real Application**
I’ve spent this whole time shooting down price to earnings as a metric because it’s frequently misused and misrepresented, but now let’s talk about where it should be used and if it adds value. It should be used as a data point. It’s not ever going to be a buy or sell signal on its own, but it can be used to compare two companies who are at similar stages of growth in similar industries. Let’s use automotive companies as an example.
Comparing Tesla to Ford using their P/E ratios is a little bit senseless because while they are within the same industry, they lie on opposite ends of the growth spectrum. Tesla sits at an insanely high P/E of about 550 whereas Ford’s is a modest 10. This shows that people have a lot more confidence in Tesla’s future earnings and growth potential than they do in Fords. This is one way to classify Tesla as a growth stock and Ford as a potential value stock and while value stocks have tended to outperform growth stocks on average this gives little indication as to whether Ford is a good value stock or not. If you were looking to add an automotive company to your portfolio and were comparing Ford to General Motors, which has a P/E of about 9, this would be a data point you could look at. You’ll see that these very similar companies have very similar P/E ratios. If you were comparing them and found that GM actually had a P/E of 20 you might give Ford a positive data point in your search for the best value automotive stock. 


#**Does P/E work on the entire market?**
So that’s how you would consider the price to earnings ratio when looking at individual companies, but can you use it to look at the entire market? Evidence leans towards saying yes, at least in the past. The paper titled “The P/E ratio and stock market performance” was published in the year 2000 before the dot com bubble popped when the market P/E was far above average. It looks at historical evidence and finds that when the market as a whole has a high P/E ratio the next decade underperforms on average. Hindsight shows that this is exactly what happened with two devastating crashes happening in the next 10 years and returns being negative overall during this period. 


However, it also makes a series of compelling arguments for why P/E ratios might start to naturally increase in the future. Some of these reasons include people having longer time horizons which lessens the risk of investing, low cost index funds have gotten even lower cost, and the barriers to investing have gone down dramatically. As of 2021 anyone can use a variety of brokerages for free from their phones. All of these things increase the number of people investing which increases the amount of money being put in the market which drives up the stocks prices but doesn’t necessarily drive up the company’s earnings – hence, a higher natural P/E ratio. With 20 more years of data, it appears that this is exactly what’s happening although there’s no guarantee that this will remain.


#**Conclusion**
P/E ratios have remained one of the most popular fundamental analysis tools for decades and with popularity often comes misinformation. When something is faster to say and more simple to remember like “Buy stocks when P/E is low” you lose some of the context and details that make it an effective tool. That being said, P/E seems to have earned its popularity. Every paper I looked into that covered the long term seems to agree that P/E can be used to make smarter investment decisions if it's used to compare similar businesses within the same sector or industry, even if just slightly.


###**TLDR**
A low price to earnings ratio can be shown to provide superior performance, at least historically. Ideally it should only be used as one of many data points when selecting a stock and should only be used to compare similar companies in similar industries. 
 

###**Mild subreddit self-promotion:**
If you enjoy these kinds of posts I created my own subreddit r/FinancialAnalysis where myself, and eventually others, will be doing this style of research.

\- Lots of innovation. New apps like the ability to accept payments directly via their platform. New partnerships with Facebook and Google to allow their users to advertise and sell on those platforms more seamlessly. Expanding in India  
\- Currently sits at 52-week low (\~$70) b/c of the recent earnings miss (dropped \~15% from before the announcement). But this appears to be a short-term overreaction   
\- Traded consistently in-range (\~$65-85) over the last 3 years, this looks to be the bottom of another such cycle before jumping back up.  
\- Super cheap options / leaps with an implied volatility of just \~30%

**Cons:**  
\- No immediate catalyst. The play is reversion to the mean  
\- Pandemic was a good thing for the company as many people tried creating online businesses from home. In the current environment, it is unclear what the trend is, reopening vs the variant. They missed their earnings target for Q2, and they provided a softer than expected Q3 sales forecast ($945m vs $948.6m, duh), but in-line full-year.  But their strategy seems to target both online and offline businesses, as well as not only attracting new customers, but also making existing ones more profitable.

However, I do in fact come bearing some pretty bullish news.

Rocket companies have quietly rolled out the test site for their new acquisition of their auto-side. A branch out of solely homes/real estate and into the car business, specifically taking advantage of the rising prices in the used car catastrophe going on in the US right now.

&amp;#x200B;



As youre also aware the company is listed for 991 million more buyback shares as of June 30th 2021, and their average price is listed right under 17$. They don’t intend on doing the buyback all at once to shoot the price up, but to create a verified floor for stock owners who worry about it falling under 16$.

&amp;#x200B;



After the quarter 2 produced billions in profit we saw the price explode far above IPO price, not because it was ready to go there but because everyone expected other people to hop on the train for some kindof second short squeeze, rather than the merit of the actual stock, completely disregarding that the actual earnings report underdelivered by a few cents. Now the price is back to trading as of right now- at the EXACT average levels that it was at after last quarters earnings report.

What this means: We might not be AT the floor but we are dangerously close to it, if youre looking to ever invest into rocket I feel that now is the perfect time. As soon as they officially announce their auto site to the press the company will be worth significantly more in fair value, and any time we tap 17$ you’ll see a dramatic increase in shares/volume/price.

I don’t want to tell you to “BUY IN IMMEDIATELY” but if you do decide to invest in this company these next few days/weeks are crucial and I believe that any second we’ll wake up one morning to the stock trading at an average price significantly higher than it is currently.

Is this the “greatest company ever” fuck no. But it is 100% without a doubt trading FAR below its actual value for a company with this big of a market cap and some minor growth potential behind it.

Tesla calls made me rich, spac calls made me richer. Then February happened and spac calls made me considerably less rich. 🤡 

Anyhow, I'm too ugly to work behind the dumpster at Wendy's, so being fresh out of tendies, I embarked on an epic quest to search for work so I could still manage to pay my wife's boyfriend. And afford fresh cum socks.

I lied about everything on my resume, and somehow landed a job as a stock broker at a large financial institution. I you knew me, you would be absolutely dumb-founded that I pulled this off. I'm incredibly unqualified and retarded. My parents and brothers were absolutely mind-fucked that I'd managed to pull this off.

I love y'all, so wanted to pass on this beautiful brown nugget of wisdom: **apply at a financial institution like the ones mentioned above, get hired, work from home, and sit back trading the memestocks while getting paid hourly for it.** You also will become a licensed stock broker and learn a fuck-ton about the markets.

Now, go away and buy shares to make your waifu happy.

&amp;#x200B;



For the rest of you who are actually decend people, I have the sweetest of DD. It's broken down in two parts:

1. The single most compelling argument to load up on $SONY: PSN
2. The rest of the business

**PSN and Netflix: what the fuck is going on here?**

Let's assume Sony sold nothing but PSN subscriptions. This company would not be too dissimilar to Netflix as:

1. Their stream of revenue comes from subscriptions (avg monthly price on Netflix: $10, PSN $8\*).
2. Their main cost is keeping the servers up and running.
3. Netflix would also have to pay for production and licensing, so I expect Sony to have a better margin. Beacause of this, I assume their net monthly income from a single user to be the same.
4. Future subscribers growth will be flat for both companies.

Currently, Netflix has 209 million subscribers and a market cap of $242B.

PSN has 109 million subscribers. If we agree on the 4 points I mentioned above, the **market cap of PSN alone** would be $126B, based on Netflix's standards.

The current market cap of Sony is (drum roll...) $122B. According to SONY's latest earning release, gaming (TOTAL Playstation universe, etc., not just PSN subscriptions!) will represent 33% of total 2021 income.

Make as many counterarguments as you want (Netflix will grow more, the value of a PSN subscriber is worth less, etc...), but even if we slash my assumed PSN market cap in half, we are **so far away** from a fair valuation of $SONY.

&amp;#x200B;



**The business**

Let's have a look at a couple of other numbers to understand if $SONY's low valuation is justified by a terrible business.

Operating income (year ended March): 2018 JPY 730B. 2019 JPY 826B. 2020 JPY 832B. 2021 JPY 968B. TTM JPY 1,022B. -&gt; they are growing income

Cash Flow: I'm too lazy to type in all numbers but they went from (JPY B) 1,2T in 2018 to 1,4T TTM. So no big growth, but stable.

P/E: 11

Profit margin: 13%

~~Price/book: 0.02 ( 😮 )~~ Edit: it seems that this ratio is miscalculated due to JPY/USD exchange. Looks like the real value is more likely around 2

Enterprise Value/EBITDA: 1.20

Intangible assets as % of total assets: 6,8% (and they have the PlayStation brand among all others... Just for a comparison, Netflix's ratio is 64%).

Also, they beat 9/10 of latest earnings:



I personally don't like the numbers here. There is no thrill in investing in something that is not a loss-making, overvalued, declining business  😴 . This is a beautiful money making machine that I am paying 2% of BOOK VALUE for. Too easy.

Positions:

Sold 11 cash covered puts at various strikes, up to $105.

IV is low, so I'm planning to add some leaps.

Let's have a quick look at AMC and some possible scenarios for next week.

TLDR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

**Price Action**

AMC is currently consolidating between 29 and 39 usd. Selling pressure has considerably slowed down in the last 4-5 weeks. Neither bears nor bulls are currently in control, the price action overall is pretty neutral. It looks like AMC is bottoming out, and has entered it's next accumulation phase, which is signaled by a period of relatively low volatility and volume which could go on over several more weeks.

Since the third of august, AMC has been trading in a relatively small upwards channel, in blue on the chart below, and I expect this to continue for a while. 

I expect the price to eventually break the red resistance line, retesting it, and then moving to the upper bound of the blue channel. I have marked this possible scenario with a green line in the chart below.

&amp;#x200B;



**MACD**

The MACD is still green and signalizes a possible continuation the price to the upside.  




 **RSI** 

The RSI is climbing, together with the price, after making a double bottom on the 4th of august:  




 

**TLDR - Points of interest**

Long  Positions: I am looking for an entry on the lower bound of the blue channel, if price falls down  there again. I am also looking for a break of the red resistance  for a rally to around 39. If 39 breaks, I am looking at around 42.5.

Short  Positions: I am looking for a bounce either off the red resistance, or the upper bound of the blue channel, back to the lower bound of the blue channel. If the lower bound of the blue channel breaks, price could go down to 29 again.

[ ](

After the initial uproar and wave of memes, there was a lot of discussion around why a company whose main income stream is from adult content decided to kill its golden goose.

**Was it because they are idiots, or because of any new regulations, or is there something much larger at play here?**

For this week’s analysis, I would be focusing on the company’s history and my take on why they did what they did and future implications for them. So, strap in while I take one for the team with my search history and ad recommendations going into questionable territory for the considerable future.

**The Company**

OnlyFans was launched by Timothy Stokely in 2016. His pitch was simple but effective.

&gt;Why not create a platform that allows these entertainers to conveniently and securely monetize their content? OnlyFans would be like a social media platform with a feed, similar to that of Instagram and Twitter, except that fans are required to pay a monthly subscription to view the content of these entertainers. And if they are willing to pay more, they could unlock paywalls for even more valuable services.

The company was extremely successful and now hosts more than 2 million content creators. It has a user base of **130 million**. Even though the service is pitched as a website for content creators such as physical fitness experts, musicians, etc., it’s predominantly known for its adult entertainment category.

The company had explosive growth during the pandemic with its revenue rising by 540% to reach $400MM. As per a [leaked pitch deck obtained by Axios]( (ironically, the company never mentions p\*rn in its pitch deck), it’s expected to create a whopping $2.5B in revenue by 2022.

**The Problem**

So, if the growth is great and the user base is becoming more and more engaged, why did the company decide to shoot itself in the foot?

As with most issues in a company, the problem lies with money! They are facing serious challenges in both the revenue stream as well as investor capital.

**Investor Capital**

[ Leaked video of OnlyFans CEO preparing for his investor pitch! ](

Even with the explosive growth, it’s not like investors are lining up for the fundraising. It would be a walk in the park to raise funding for any other company with its growth trajectory and profitability. But there are multiple challenges in the case of OnlyFans:

* Some VC funds are prohibited from investing in adult content as part of their partnership agreements.
* Even though OnlyFans has a verification process, the risk of minors creating subscription accounts is real and will do irreversible reputation damage for both the company and its investors.

Even if the investors could look past all of this as the company looks to raise [new funding at unicorn valuation]( OnlyFans has a reputation problem. Even if the brand could move on to a “safe for work” platform, the history associated with the brand is synonymous with adult content.

Given its history, it would be extremely difficult to attract brand partners and big names into the platform. The presence of big names is a must for a platform trying to become a more mainstream media site!

**Payment Processing**

While brand imaging and raising capital might be a longer-term problem for the company, the more pressing issue is a [BBC investigation into how the company handles illegal content]( and its ramifications. If you thought Google had monopolistic power, let me introduce you to

[ ](

Visa and Mastercard combinedly process [more than 90% of transactions and 75% of transaction volume]( of all Credit card purchases in the US. In Dec 2020, after a NY Times article about how P\*rnHub monetizes illegal content, both Visa and Mastercard cut off payments to the site within 6 days! \[1\]. This caused them to remove 70% of all content (unverified) on their website (aka The Purge) to try and get the payment platforms on board. Visa and Mastercard still won’t work with the company even after all the drastic actions taken by P\*rnHub.

Given that the OnlyFans platform doesn’t show any ads, they would be dead in the water if their direct payment takes a hit. In April, Mastercard had announced a change to their policy \[2\] that requires this:

&gt;The banks that connect merchants to our network... to certify that the seller of adult content has effective controls in place to monitor, block and, where necessary, take down all illegal content.

The policy will come into effect on October 15th and OnlyFans is trying to be compliant by the time the policy is enforced \[3\] and it seems like they are going by the logic that desperate times require desperate measures \[4\]!  

**What now?**

The Billion dollar question is whether OnlyFans would go the way Tumblr went (Tumblr was [once valued at $1.1B and was sold later for $3M]( after they banned all adult content on their website.

[ ](

It seems that OnlyFan’s aspirations of becoming a mainstream media company and increasing regulations by payment partners are forcing the company to abandon the adult segment. While we currently don’t have an insight into their revenue split, it’s safe to say that a majority of it would be coming from the adult segment which would make the pivot even harder to pull off successfully.

I don’t know a single company that has survived after throwing their most loyal userbase and revenue generators under the bus for greener pastures! Maybe they are just concerned about their short-term survival and were forced to make this decision. But dropping the same folks who made you popular in the first place is definitely going to leave a bad aftertaste.

After all, what do *we* know? Running a billion-dollar company is a [very serious business!](

Until next week!

**Footnotes**

\[1\] This would cause all normal credit card transactions to fail and then the only way for them to charge would be to directly get paid to their bank accounts or via crypt\*, both of which would be extremely difficult to process and scale.

\[2\] While there is a lot of chatter around how certain groups lobbied Mastercard to change their policy, I am not getting into that as it would inevitably take a political turn.

\[3\] To put this into perspective, if 4 companies (Visa, Mastercard, AmEx, and Discover) cut off your payment pipeline, you would effectively have no way to charge your customer!

\[4\] There is a lot of conversation around how this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for crypt\* to shine with the decentralized payment system.

\[5\] Granted, they were already seeing reduced engagement prior to the ban, but the adult content ban was the final nail in the coffin! [This]( is a hilarious parody video of Tumblr CEO explaining the ban!

Palantir’s retail investors are also a class of their own and Karp recognizes this as noted in one of his recent interviews.

Karp and Thiel added over $57m in gold and they are pro digital currencies so that's a plus. No debt and \~2.4B cash on hand.

They are aiming to be Skynet...make of that what you will.

**BioNTech &amp; Moderna - Vaccine/mRNA unicorns**

I was motivated to make this DD post because while these vaccine stocks have been crazy hot over the past year, they don't get much attention on WSB which is a bit surprising.  These aren't for the faint of heart, but traders looking for volatility, you won't need a blue pill to get hard.

I will try to highlight some of the key differences and you can make a choice of which you prefer.  My personal choice is BioNTech, reason being they are much cheaper when comparing financial metrics, and also because I think their vaccine is the best in terms of safety and efficacy.  It is also what I'm vaccinated with, and the 5G reception has been great.

**Pfizer &amp; BioNTech partnership**

Most folks refer to BioNTech’s vaccine as ‘Pfizer’, but the vaccine actually belongs to BioNTech, but licensed to Pfizer with profit split down the line in most regions as well as milestone payments to BioNTech ($748 million).  There is also a small equity investment in BioNTech by Pfizer.  Pfizer was interested in acquiring BioNTech, but the owners have no interest in selling. 

**Making history as the first FDA approved mRNA vaccine**

In recent news from Friday, Pfizer/BioNTech is to become the first fully FDA approved vaccine as early as this Monday. First mover advantage is key to locking down market share, as well as advancing the mRNA vaccine booster approvals. With the mRNA technology platform vetted with an FDA approval, Pfizer/BioNTech will be moving yet further ahead of the competition.  Mandates will start soon as this is approved, and BioNTech will be the first choice.  Also, BioNTech is in more arms, and the boosters are advised to follow the primary shots so they will also lock up a lot of doses.

Moderna approval is said to be several weeks away, so they aren't far behind either if things go their way.

Comparing BioNTech and Moderna based on market cap and financial metrics, Moderna currently has a higher valuation/multiple even though BioNTech has double the earnings per share. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Fundamentals](

For the next ten years, the COVID vaccine revenues will be the drivers for these companies. I won’t go into the scientific differences between the mRNA vaccines, as this is WSB and I’m not epidemiologist or scientist. 

We know both vaccines are very similar and effective but differ by dosage (Pfizer having 30 micrograms vs Moderna having 100 micrograms per dose). Both of these will require boosters for the foreseeable future with what looks like 8 month intervals (though Moderna may have longer durability due to the dosage). Science supports this since the virus will continue to mutate. Countries such as Canada have already ordered boosters for the entire population out to 2024. 

**Ownership and Insiders**

BioNTech is 50% owned by the Strüngmann brothers, who seeded the company. Next the CEO Ugur Sahin owns around 17% of the company. This means 67% of the stock is basically out of the picture. These guys have not sold a single share as this has run up from single dollars to $465.

Institutional ownership as of the last report was approximately 17%. This means that 84% of the shares (out of 241 million) are not being actively traded, leaving a paltry 38.5 million shares. 

Moderna while having more shares outstanding has a very strong institutional ownership base of 64% of float, and 10% by insiders, so 74% of the shares are spoken for. Since Moderna is an S&amp;P component (BioNTech is a German company, listed as an ADR so does not qualify for it), it gets more volume and institutional interest. In the last six months, about 11 million shares have been sold by insiders, which is not unusual given how well it has performed. 

From a share structure perspective, I think the low float and high ownership by the founders of BioNTech make it possible for more upside, but both are currently Wall Street darlings, and Moderna gets more attention in the media.

**Marketshare**

Pfizer distributes the vaccine to 165 countries around the world. The net profit from the sale of the vaccine is split 50/50 between Pfizer and BioNTech. 

&amp;#x200B;

[More primary shots = more boosters](

BioNTech separately has a deal with China based Fosun Pharmaceuticals to distribute in Asia. Fosun is to start production in China at the end of August upon administrative approval (regulator approval already happened last month), eventually producing up to 200 million doses a month to supply Asia. Pfizer/BioNTech did not take US government money to develop their vaccine, which makes it an exception. BioNTech did get $445 million from Germany for the development.

Moderna has a smaller reach currently than Pfizer/BioNTech in terms of global distribution and have had some issues scaling fast enough to meet contracts.  However, they are expecting to produce 800-900 million doses for 2021, and up to 3 billion in 2022. Moderna had significant funding by the US Government ($6 Billion), so they are not in a good position to attempt raising prices in the US (though I have heard they may have recently, not sure).  

Pfizer/BioNTech wins the distribution hands down, as they were first to launch and scale their production in mass. Also in the US, the BioNTech is able to be given to ages 12 and up, whereas Moderna is currently 18 and over. This could change, but recent reports suggest BioNTech is perhaps a better choice for younger folks due to fewer side effects compared to Moderna, perhaps due to the difference in dosage.

&amp;#x200B;



**Pipeline**

For pipeline, they both have a lot of treatments under development based on mRNA technology. They both are going to be very cash rich, and will have no issues funding and expediting their candidates with no financing concerns for the foreseeable future. Now that they’ve proven mRNA delivery technology and safety, they are both targeting blockbuster drugs (cancer, HIV).  They will also grow via acquisitions.

BioNTech pipeline has a heavy focus on oncology, 21 or 27 of their candidate are cancer related. They also have another partnership with Pfizer to develop a flu shot which started Phase 1 earlier this year. BioNTech has one drug in the phase 2 stage - BNT122 for metastatic melanoma.

Moderna has a more diversified pipeline (HIV, Zika, Flu). They just started human trial of their HIV vaccine.  They also have a treatment for cytomegalovirus that is expected to begin phase 3 trials in 2021, and in phase 2 have a cancer vaccine mRNA-4157, to be given in combination with Merck’s Keytruda.

**Technicals**

BioNTech has consenus of $320.44 and Moderna $276.45, but these includes some older targets which have yet to be updated.  BioNTech has had multiple upgrades over the past two weeks ($450 Canaccord, $433 Goldman).  Moderna has recent targets of $425 by Jeffries and $461 by Goldman.  

Both of these stocks are extremely volatile.  They went parabolic in recent months and got overbought.  They both fell 30% from recent highs in a matter of days, but are now consolidating and inching up again. The selling of these were not based on any fundamental news, but technically the vertical move couldn't be sustained. Earnings blowout and some criticism by some analysts on valuation are mentioned as catalysts, but I think they just went up too far, too fast. This is a run of the mill correction, but I suspect it has now run it's course.  It's given a great opportunity for new investors to get in at a discount to recent highs.

Keep in mind they both have high correlation to each other, so they almost always move together, but MRNA has outperformed BNTX as of late.

&amp;#x200B;



I believe both of these will at least retest all time highs (464 for BNTX, and 497 for MRNA), possibly go even higher if we get another variant after the delta that requires further changes to the vaccine (this is probably more likely that we'll want to admit).  The pipeline for both is promising, and these trade more like tech stocks than biotech since mRNA has proven with the COVID vaccine that it will revolutionize the industry and both of these companies are at the forefront.

**Risks:**  The biggest risk is the variants mutate to something less deadly, less warranting booster shots. In my opinion these stocks will likely peak then decline sometime in early - mid 2022 as the pandemic changes into an epidemic.  There is also risk of competition, but I think these have such a commanding lead, I don't see anyone choosing another vaccine over these, given the billions of doses and FDA approvals they will have ahead of the competition.  Folks are turning down Astrazeneca and JNJ, willing to risk waiting unvaccinated for one of the aforementioned mRNA vaccines.

TDLR for those who can’t be bothered to read:

**In a nutshell:** Both are great plays on COVID and mRNA, especially now that boosters are now seen as durable reoccurring revenues (though they are expected to decline after 2022). Like the flu, we’ll be getting COVID shots many years from now based on science and history (flu pandemic of 1918, we’re still getting shots due to variants and waning immunity, the same issues plaguing us with COVID).  However, BioNTech is fundamentally much better valued than Moderna as the EPS is double that of Moderna, and they have the first mover advantage and brand awareness (due to Pfizer).

This is not financial advice. It's a guide on how tendies are good for your health.

**Table of Contents**

* Introduction
* EUA vs FDA Full Approval
* Time to get cuckold, $MRNA, $PFE just took the 100mg Viagra and is your wife's boyfriend

**I. Introduction**

On 8/20/21, during after hours, $PFE had two breaking news:

1. EU marketing authorization of its Xeljanz, treatment against arthritic conditions ([source](
2. FDA Full Approval of $PFE COVID vaccines ([source](

Surely, these headlines are fuel for our rocket ships to the moon? Maybe, maybe not. Headlines shouldn't convince you to invest in something, otherwise you'd pull out on that $CLOV Shitenburg piece right? (wink wink) You should understand what the fluffs are so that you have full conviction on the play. This discussion is to accomplish exactly that, to point out the important differences between an FDA Full Approval vs. an EUA and why it's time for $PFE to fucking fly.

**II. EUA vs FDA Full Approval**

* **EUA**: emergency use authorization is when the FDA requires only half of the samples to be monitored for 2 months post-vaccinations (i.e. taking a short-cut or reading a WSB DD to gamble 100% of my savings)
* **FDA Full Approval**: is when the FDA requires ALL of the samples to be monitored for a minimum of six months post-vaccinations, including examinations beyond the vaccination side effects such as manufacturing and inspection qualities (i.e. doing u/DeepFuckingValue level of DD before investing)

If the examples are insufficient, an EUA is like your mum telling you tendies are good for you while an FDA full approval is like a doctor telling you the tendies are so good, you shouldn't just stick it down your throat, but also up your ass and your wife boyfriend's ass.

What's the point of comparing the two? Well, it's simple. All COVID vaccines as of date, have not received the FDA Full Approval including $MRNA, $JNJ, etc. but $PFE will this upcoming week. Do what you will with this information but speculations from my end is that, with a fully approved vaccine, I'd imagine $PFE will be mandated for the 30% unvaccinated U.S. adults (I mean, google ""vaccine passports"" and the timing of this approval is just too perfect) and $PFE will be distributed globally to countries that desperately need vaccines (e.g. VP of US, Kamala, traveling to Vietnam and SEA, presumably to discuss distributions to the desperate lockdowned regions).

**III. Time to get cuckold, $MRNA, $PFE just took the 100mg Viagra and is your wife's boyfriend**

Through the entirety of the 2020 outbreak and our recovery in 2021, $MRNA took the spotlight. Here are three reasons why $PFE will overcome the shadows of $MRNA:

* With $MRNA low floats and high volatility (evident by a beta of 1.49), $PFE laggard ass got cuckold with its low beta of .67 (almost as low as Great Grandfather Buffet's favorite darling, $KO, with a beta of .63). So, for $PFE to shine, it'll need a similar price action as $MRNA, right? Well, so how the fuck does $PFE get there with 5.6B floats? With the aforementioned headlines. After the two breaking news dropped, $PFE made the ""V formation"" in after-hours on 8/20/2021, V for 100mg Viagra erection movement; a formation defined by yours truly.



* Again, another speculation, but let's play a game: who between $PFE, $MRNA, $JNJ would be the most likely to get FDA full approval before everyone? You'd probably guessed $MRNA a month ago. It's also possible that investors thought that $MRNA of all vaccine players would have the highest likelihood to receive the full FDA approval before others. Well, the tides have turned and $PFE just won this arm race.
* As $PFE get the full approval announcement, $MRNA gets a bad data news regarding the side effects of its COVID vaccines and is rumored to be probed by the FDA ([source]( I took Moderna vaccines, so if $PFE rockets this Monday on 8/23/2021 and my 150 call options flies but I die from the side effects, then apes, please take my tendies and give it to my wife's boyf",EUA vs. FDA Approval: how $PFE overcomes the shadow of $MRNA,52,3

In the last 3 months I have lost 90% of my money on just 3 bad trades not related to this (shit happens) after a good year of trading with hundreds of success, and in the next 3 months I will get it back and much more. 



**THE PLAN**

YOU MUST PAY ATTENTION TO THIS PART AND UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS THE REAL TRADE. SKLZ is just a vehicle.



***THE TRADE :** YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THIS:

Never before have mega-corporations, mutual funds, private equity firms, had **so much dry powder available to be deployed** (AKA tons of cash on their balance sheets), **in an inflationary environment** that makes keeping money parked on the balance sheets unattractive, pushing their managers to seek options to use the money (such as retained earnings) and not keep it in dollars while they devalue. 

Because mega-corporations, mutual funds, private equity firms are sit on tons of cash **It is reasonable to expect that some will choose to add some kind of hedge against inflation to their balance sheets**, such as buying gold, or digital assets as we have seen in recent examples. ***However, these options are considerably more volatile than the dollar, and many boards of directors do not appreciate the idea of ​​subjecting their retained earnings to high volatility. But instead seek to buy, merge or takeover others smaller companies***  (See the discussion on this topic by Sosnoff and Ratigan, in the second half of their latest podcast [ For those of you who don't know who they are, stop reading right now, and please look for them, and then come back)


**That is why I consider it inevitable that acquisitions of smaller companies will increase,** *and im supported by data* *(M&amp;A typical accelerates toward Q3 and Q4: See Price Waterhouse Coopers report* on that [* **as way to manage balance sheets overloaded with cash,** *in order to maintain growth in an inflationary environment and prevent devaluation of retained earnings.*

As a consequence of this **The plan is to find a good probable acquisition target soon enough and ride the momentum up using in the money calls with 45 or more days to go.**


**IN SEARCH FOR THE TRADING VEHICLE:**

Within this universe of Mergers and Acquisitions (M&amp;A) we must be clear that the first companies to be subject to acquisitions will be those that can have **high growth, low debt, and generate profits**. This is where SKILLZ comes in, ticker $ SKLZ.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE TRIGGER TO START THE POSITION: WHY DID I CHOOSE SKLZ ?** THE RUMOR:

*CTNF RUMOR OF SKLZ BEING TARGETED FOR TAKEOVER.*

What attracted my attention most powerfully to SKLZ was that  CTFN  published a rumor reported by Sarah Cohen that SKLZ is being watched to be acquired by competitors in a takeover. (See who she is in this thread [

CTFN is a team of journalists and analysts trained in merger processes, with sources in industry, finance, regulatory bodies, and the legal profession. They uncover leading-edge stories, risks, and opportunities associated with M&amp;A and more.

In takeovers scenarios, **the trade is to buy the target** and sell the one doing the takeover. We dont know who the interested party is yet, but we do know SKLZ has a profile good enough to be on the crosshair of many.

&amp;#x200B;

**The trading vehicle merits: WHY SKILLZ ($SKLZ)**

* Analyst consensus $18.00
* Price at the moment: 10.5
* $ SKLZ has 0 debt. Go check the. 10 Q. [
* THIS SI CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: **Its warrants expired on August 16**. See: August 16, 2021 **Form25-NSE** Notification filed by National Security Exchange to report the removal from listing and registration of matured, redeemed or retired securities Initial Filing Amendments. [
* SKLZ posted its 22nd Consecutive Quarter of Growth.
* Record Q2 Revenue.
* Revenue beat ($ 89.5M vs consensus $ 88.2M).
* Revised FY21 revenue upward to $ 376M from $ 375M, consensus $ 376.15M - plus $ 13 million revenue contribution from the business combination with Aarki resulting in combined 2021 revenue of $ 389 million.

For more details I refer you to this illustrative analysis of - 1pitchin, where you can find more information: [

&amp;#x200B;

**Social perception:**

* SKLZ is also a company that in the past has enjoyed the attention of very important investment funds, such as  Cathy Woods.
* Has 40K followers on Stocktwits.
* GEN -Z stock.

&amp;#x200B;

**TECHNICALS:**

On the technical side, SKLZ is hitting its lowest point in 52 weeks.

The RSI indicator shows highly oversold.

The index to which it belongs, the Russel 2000 is in the support area.

Volume is x2 since warrants expiration. 30 M volume las friday wich is a lot considering the low volume scenario we have been trading on since Aug began.

Risk Reward is good if we take into account analyst forecasts.

&amp;#x200B;

**REASONING AFTER SEEN ALL THAT:**

In the macroeconomic environment we find ourselves in, ***I give weight and credibility to the idea that SKLZ could be the object of a takeover attempt, which would increase the demand for the stock***. 

I increase my conviction that this is possible because having reviewed the work history of the reporter who broke the rumor, Sarah Cohen, I see that it is very likely to be true.

After Considering that SKLZ's technical analysis shows that there is an advantage in buying when in an oversold state, and that the Russell 2000 index is in support at 212, from which it has bounced 4 times this year, i have a clear limited risk below which i can get out ( the resent lows ) 

***After Considering that the warrants expired on August 16 and that their impact is over.***

Finally I decided to act as following:

 **The following is My trade: I bought with the money I had left over (5k) 27 contracts of $ 10 Calls, for October 15, 2021 at 1.65 each, for around 4500 dollars, when the news of the CTFN rumor came out, and I plan to sell. half when $ SKLZ reaches 15, and the other half stay with them until the first week of October.*** 

See ya on money land bitchas.

Alibaba stock has been on a sharp downtrend since November even as the former China leader continues to deliver strong earnings and sales growth. Increased regulatory scrutiny has weighed on Alibaba stock in recent months and the stock has fallen almost than 50% off its high. BABA stock looks like it's on sale now, but is Alibaba stock a buy now?

China stocks sold off hard on July 23 after Beijing cracked down on education stocks like **TAL Education (TAL)** and **New Oriental Education (EDU)** fell more than 50%.

Alibaba on Aug. 3 reported a 22% rise in quarterly profit. Revenue increased 44% to $31.9 billion. Alibaba said it had 1.18 billion annual active customers during the 12 months that ended June 30, up 45 million from the previous quarter. It reported 939 million mobile active users, up 14 million. The company also increased its share buyback program by $5 billion to $15 billion.

Cloud computing revenue increased 29% to $2.49 billion.

**Alibaba** gapped down on May 13 after the company missed expectations, but revenue growth accelerated for the fourth straight quarter, soaring 77% to $28.6 billion.

**Strong Results**

Alibaba's Q3 earnings report in February revealed another quarter of strong bottom-line and top-line growth.

Adjusted earnings rose 30% to $3.38 a share. Revenue growth accelerated for the third straight quarter, jumping 46% to $33.87 billion. Revenue for the company's cloud computing business grew 50% year over year to $2.47 billion.

One day after its earnings report, Alibaba stock jumped 3.5% on Feb. 3 after the company's fintech arm, Ant Group, struck a deal with Chinese regulators to restructure and become a financial holding company. Ant Group operates a suite of financial products, including the widely used Alipay digital wallet in China.

**Sellers Hit BABA Stock**

Sellers knocked Alibaba stock lower on Nov. 3 after the $34.5 billion Ant Group IPO, the fintech arm of Alibaba, was suspended in Shanghai and Hong Kong. The decision to suspend the IPO came after Shanghai exchange officials said the exchange would halt the listing due to the company's inability to fulfill conditions amid changes in the regulatory environment.

BABA stock crashed another 8% on Nov. 10 after Chinese regulators announced new draft antimonopoly rules for China online platforms like Alibaba and **JD.com** (JD), among others.

**Alibaba Stock Fundamental Analysis**

It's hard to find a company with a more impressive track record of growth than Alibaba. The company has a five-year annualized earnings growth rate of 29%.

Expectations were high for Alibaba's Singles Day annual shopping event in November, China's biggest shopping day. The company didn't disappoint as sales nearly doubled from the year-ago period to $74 billion.

The company has been able to stay in growth mode despite a slowdown in its core e-commerce business.

Alibaba's business in China looks a lot like Amazon's in the U.S. Alibaba’s cloud-computing business is showing solid growth, just like Amazon's booming web services business.

For its current fiscal year 2022, Alibaba is expected to earn $9.58 a share, down 4% compared to 2021. But growth is expected to ramp higher in 2023, up 23% to $11.79.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:**

Now that we’ve established this we can continue with what I think might be happening with the Elvish anal stock. 

As were all aware now, PLTR is buying a shit ton of gold and trying except digital currency as well, this is believed to be to hedge against the “Black Swan” event. For anyone unaware this is just any major event that is unexpected, a lot of people see this as a market crash. 

Somewhat irrelevant to the post, but if there is a crash I imagine another huge inflow of buying will take place proving my theory that stocks only go up. Who dosent buy the dip, only bitches. 

Anyway, recently PLTR has been said to be able to use its services to accurately predict things that have not even happened yet, this is super bullish for PLTR and could add so much value to their product. 

If this is true, Palantir may have predicted a near term market crash.

# **Fed officials will seek to avoid a tantrum as they keep ‘taper talk’ going at Jackson Hole - [(Source)](
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve’s efforts to reverse its easy policy will be a dominant theme for markets in the week ahead, as central bankers gather in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
*****
&gt; The central bankers may even look relaxed against the backdrop of the Grand Tetons in the crisp late August air. But they will be under pressure to gently steer toward less policy support, without creating a market tantrum.
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve officials, in numerous recent speeches and interviews, have already managed to speed up expectations for when they could begin to slowly pare back their $120 billion a month in bond purchases. More of that talk is expected at their annual symposium, which begins Thursday.
*****
&gt; The Fed chairman’s speech is typically the highlight of the annual event, and various Fed chairs have used Jackson Hole to send important messages. The question is whether Jerome Powell will channel his speech Friday morning to provide more details on how the Fed could begin to unwind its bond buying, and even whether he is personally ready to embrace it.
*****
&gt; “We’re not expecting a big policy reveal at this meeting,” said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short strategy at Bank of America. “I don’t think Powell wants to front run the [September] meeting, given the myriad of voices that are out there. I don’t think this is the time when Powell really wants to make a splash.”
*****
&gt; Besides the Fed, the week has a few economic reports. Existing home sales are released Monday; new home sales Tuesday and durable goods Wednesday. Friday has personal consumption expenditures data and the inflation index, closely watched by the Fed.
*****
&gt; Earnings are also expected from companies including Best Buy and Nordstrom on Tuesday, Salesforce.com on Wednesday and HP and Dell Technologies on Thursday.
*****
&gt; # Fed and markets
But the Fed will matter most, as investors will also keep an eye on how the economy is responding to the spread of the Covid delta variant. Stocks were lower in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 down 0.6%.
*****
&gt; There could be some volatility around the Fed’s symposium, after the release this past Tuesday of minutes from the last official meeting rattled investors. The minutes described most members of the Federal Open Market Committee as being ready to taper this year if the economy is strong enough. Cabana said he changed his view after that release and now expects the Fed to begin paring back purchases in November, rather than January.
*****
&gt; “We just think this signal in communications is pretty clear,” he said. “For now, it’s safe to say they are wanting to start later this year, and we think the data will allow them to do that.”
*****
&gt; As for Powell, “he’s not going to announce taper. What we anticipate is that he’s going to give a live speech that talks about a lot of the progress that has been made since the start of Covid, and there’s a lot of it,” said Cabana. He said Powell could reiterate that the Fed will be data dependent in its decision to taper, and that many Fed officials believe it could make sufficient progress toward that goal later this year.
*****
&gt; The minutes caused hiccups in markets as investors reacted to the idea that the Fed will take its first steps toward peeling away the extraordinary amount of policy it used to fight the impact of the pandemic. Tapering the bond program could take months, but once it ends it could herald the onset of rate hikes.
*****
&gt; Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said Powell should provide a road map for how the Fed will taper, but with the caveat of being able to step back if Covid becomes more serious than expected.
*****
&gt; “The asset purchases were initially to stabilize financial conditions. ... There’s clearly a consensus building stronger than it even was at the last meeting in July, given how [Fed officials] have been speaking out since then,” said Swonk. “They want to wind down asset purchases. As they wind them down, they’re not hitting the brakes. They’re only lifting their foot off the accelerator. The difference is important for [Powell] to lay out at Jackson Hole.”
*****
&gt; Swonk said the Fed needs to provide a road map for tapering, but also with off ramps in the event that Covid is worse than expected.
*****
&gt; “To avoid this becoming a tantrum and avoid financial markets seizing up again, he wants to get the messaging out and the context of it, as much as possible,” Swonk said. “If this becomes a disorderly reaction and things are melting down, they would have to pivot. Where we’re at is these types of purchases are no longer justified and may be detrimental in terms of how much liquidity they’re putting into financial markets when its no longer needed.”

&gt; # September Almanac: DJIA, S&amp;P 500 &amp; NASDAQ Worst Month of Year

&gt; Start of the business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school once made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971), Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 (since 1979). After four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup, S&amp;P 500 was down five Septembers straight from 1999-2003. In the 17 years since, S&amp;P 500 has advanced 11 times in September and declined six times.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](

&gt; In post-election years, September’s overall rank improves modestly in post-election years going back to 1953 (third or fourth worst month depending on index). Average losses are little changed. Although September 2001 does influence the average declines, the fact remains DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have declined in 9 of the last 17 post-election year Septembers. Russell 2000 has the best post-election year record, up seven times in 10 years.

&gt; # US Dollar Breaks Out

&gt; After roughly two months of declines, at the end of May the US dollar (proxied by Bloomberg's dollar index) found support around the lows from the first week of the year. Since then, the dollar has rallied 4.13%, moving back above its moving averages in the process which have also acted as support ever since. This week alone the dollar has gained 1.4%, and that upward move brings the dollar to the highest levels since early November and the early spring highs when the index stopped short of its 200-DMA.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](

&gt; Taking a step back to look at the past five years, those lows that were reached earlier this spring and at the start of the year can actually be traced all the way back to early 2018 lows. Similarly, the recent highs that were taken out this week are around the same levels as the early 2016 lows. With the dollar now having broken out, it is no longer at the low end of that five-year range.

&gt; # One of the Best Weeks of the Year for Claims

&gt; Initial jobless claims hit another pandemic low this week dropping to 348K from last week's 2K upwardly revised reading of 377K. That was also 16K below expectations and the first better than expected print in six weeks. While recent releases have disappointed relative to forecasts, this week did mark the fourth week in a row that claims have dropped. That is the longest stretch of consecutive declines since a six-week streak ending on June 4th.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](

&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, initial claims fell to 308.57K which is again the lowest level since the start of the pandemic. Meanwhile, pandemic unemployment assistance claims ticked up to 109.38K from 103.85K the previous week. The main state driving that increase was Ohio which saw claims more than double. Maryland, Oregon, and California were the other states to have seen the biggest increase in PUA claims. Those increases also come even as the program is slated to end in just two weeks on September 4th.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](

&gt; As for the decline in claims for unadjusted regular state programs, we would caution against reading too deep into the number on account of strong seasonal tailwinds. As shown below, the current week of the year (33rd) is tied at second for the week of the year that most often sees claims decline. As shown in the second chart below, there has only been one year, last year, in which claims were higher week over week in the 33rd week of the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](

&gt; Seasonally adjusted continuing claims missed expectations by 20K this week, but at 2.82 million, this week's reading still marked a third consecutive decline. As such, claims are still at the lowest level of the pandemic and are closing in on coming within one million from the March 2020 levels.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](

&gt; While the most recent reading on continuing claims was lower, purely looking at regular state claims does not show the full picture. Including all other programs creates some additional lag meaning the most recent data is through the last week of July. Through that week, total claims fell below 12 million for the first time of the pandemic, totaling 11.76 million. Driving that decline were 79.9K and 66.08K declines in regular state and PEUC programs. The biggest decline came from the extended benefits program, though. That program saw claims get more than cut in half after a significant uptick the previous week. Throughout the month of July, claim counts for the extended benefits program were particularly volatile. They started off the month with a sub-100K reading of 98.4K, then rose all the way up to 343.5K, dropped to 239.6K, then rose again to 398.8K before falling back down to 177.9K in the week of July 30th.

&gt; # Homebuilder Sentiment: The Next Big Miss

&gt; Prior to the pandemic, the NAHB's record monthly reading on homebuilder sentiment was back in December 1998 when the index hit 78. Last November, the sentiment bar was set even higher when the index reached 90. Since then, though, two-thirds of the releases have declined month over month. The most recent release saw the index drop five more points to 75, marking the first time in a year that homebuilder sentiment came in below the pre-pandemic record high. Additionally, August's 5-point drop is the largest one-month decline since last April when the index collapsed by a record 42 points at the onset of the pandemic. It is also tied with a dozen other months for the seventh-largest month-over-month decline in the history of the index going back to 1985.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](

&gt; While the release indicates worsening, but still historically strong, sentiment among homebuilders, it can be added to the growing list of economic indicators that have been coming in well below expectations. As we noted in last week's Bespoke Report, Citi Surprise indices measuring how economic data comes in relative to estimates tipped into negative territory last week. That was as the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment survey saw the biggest miss relative to expectations on record. Today's reading on homebuilders was not far off those results. The five-point miss relative to expectations was the largest since last April and is tied with 4 other months (April and May 2006, November 2008, and October 2014) for the six largest miss going back to at least 2003.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](

&gt; Driving the decline in the headline reading were five-point drops in present sales and traffic. Even though there has been deterioration in those readings on current conditions, future sales have held up better going unchanged at 81.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](

&gt; Looking across regions, the ones that have seen COVID cases rising the most of late, namely in the South and Midwest, generally saw sharp drops in homebuilder sentiment in August although those are in the context of longer-term declines. The Northeast and the West, on the other hand, are off of their peaks but each region did show an uptick in sentiment for August.

The Biden administration just banned the importation of Russian ammunition, which makes up the overwhelming majority of cheap steel cased ammo used in the US. Last year, we saw record buyups of firearms and ammunition at the peak of the pandemic. .223/5.56 used in AR15s was first to go and is still incredibly difficult to find at decent prices. As a substitute, 7.62x39 became increasingly popular over the past year as more and more gun enthusiasts shifted to AKs and other guns chambered in this caliber since it was available more regularly and stayed in stock longer than 5.56. In the months leading up to today, 7.62x39 almost came back down to pre-pandemic prices. 

However, with the ban upcoming, the biggest source of 7.62x39 is getting cut off especially since it is a primarily Russian caliber. As of today, ammo prices are back at peak pandemic prices. All other ammo prices are also going up significantly because steel cased ammo provided the cheap alternative to brass ammo. 

Looking forward, all those folks who were shifting over to AKs no longer have the reason to do so. Instead, domestic production of 5.56 is probably going to bring people flocking back to the AR15 platform since it's what they'll be able to get ammo for in the coming months/years.

So, what to do? Vista Outdoor (VSTO) acquired the Remington Ammunition plant last year and has been in full swing since February of this year. VSTO also owns Federal, another major American ammunition manufacturer. Since December 2020, VSTO has doubled in price and could see more upside as American ammunition demand spikes.

Meanwhile, Smith &amp; Wesson could be looking at a bump up as they are one of the many popular manufacturers of budget AR15s, such as the M&amp;P15 line. They also produce a long line of popular handguns, particularly their 9mm Shields which have been amongst the most popular for Concealed Carry, a practice which has also been rising in popularity over the years (9mm also continues to be in extremely high demand and is very difficult to find right now).

Anyway, I plan to buy shares and maybe some longer dated calls in the coming week.

**TL;DR: Cheap Russian ammo imports banned, domestic guns and ammo go up.**

**UPDATE: Took a position on VSTO on Monday but chose a terrible entry so I sold today for -9%. Got in on SWBI today   9/17 25C @ 1.35**","Russian ammo imports banned, looking at a bump in SWBI &amp; VSTO",59,2

**The Smart Money Has Already Sold**  

August 18, 2021

The game is as old as the stock market: *the Smart Money recognizes the top is in, and in order to sell all their shares,* ***they need to recruit bagholders to buy their shares and hold them all the way down.*** 

The greatest ally of the Smart Money is ***buy the dip***, as ***the bagholders trained to buy the dip will continue buying every dip on the way down until their capital is expended.*** **Bagholders see every rally off a dip as proof buy the dip works,** when every rally off a dip has been engineered to suck in bagholders.

Every rally is another opportunity to sell for the Smart Money.

The greatest hindrance to the Smart Money selling is low volume. ***The main point of selling is to dribble out shares in such modest doses that the price doesn't move.*** If a big block of shares is dumped all at once, then the price collapses in low-volume markets. So **the Smart Money sells slowly and methodically,** transferring 100 million shares over time to a million bagholders who each buy 100 shares.""

Bull Case: Growing revenue, member growth, highest optionality in the space, owns Galileo which provides neo-banking service to Robinhood and other Fintechs and of course a Pending Bank charter, and they recently purchased a community bank presumably to help with compliance  in the charter application. 

Bear Case: Member growth slowed in Q2 from Q1. Huge EPS miss and “they are just a bank”

The division between bulls and bears is mostly around the EPS miss. The CEO and CFO pointed out that the EPS miss was from one wine expenses related to purchasing Galileo and the new rules around how former “blank check companies” treat warrants. They now are liabilities. The CFO pointed out that these are one time, non cash, paper only expenses but were expenses in Q2 and without them… they hit their target.

Now, before you read this fake ass DD about PTRA, check out my last DD about ASTR going from 8 to 10+ during the middle of August and I posted exactly during the 8 dollar price range, and how some apes got bitch slapped say'n the stock's going down to $5. I made a sizeable profit, didn't really sell at the 15 range but it was gooood profit taking.

&amp;#x200B;

Now apes, why are we buying electric buses instead of lambos? Boi, it's 2021 and buses can host more hookers once you x100 your portfolio and it's zero emission so we are protecting the environment at the same fucking time.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;



Take a look at this chat. If I remember correctly, what goes down must come back up. PTRA almost hit the mid-8 dollar range this week, but it hold itself alright and came back like a motherfucker almost breaking $10 today. Now it's dropping again and it's the perfect time to buy the dip before it climbs back to the $16 dollar range.

&amp;#x200B;

What does the company do?

&amp;#x200B;

They make electric buses, yep, that's about it and some battery stuff too.

I will have the lengthy description for the fancy apes:

""Proterra is a leader in the **design and manufacture of zero-emission electric transit vehicles and EV technology solutions for commercial applications**.  Since 2004, Proterra registered technology has been proven through more  than 20 million service miles in heavy-duty applications."" which means they also make batteries.

Now we all know Biden is trying to make half of US new vehicles made electric by 2030 but we can't take him seriously. My goal here is to make a quick swing profit and sell the news.

According to the white house, Biden aims to electrify 50,000 diesel buses, or roughly 70% of the U.S. fleet over the next eight years.

And currently,  Of the United State's roughly 70,000 largely diesel transit buses, only  around 2% are currently zero emission, according to the Center for  Transportation and Environment, which advises transit agencies on clean  energy buses.

The stock is currently wayyy oversold and an great entry point to hop in the electrical bus ride.

This is the options chain for the calls expiring this week.  3200 was clearly a significant number, and AMZN closed at 3199.95.  That's fucking hilarious.  Someone clearly wanted it below that number.

&amp;#x200B;

[The 5 minute chart is super bullish into close today](

&amp;#x200B;



The daily chart makes it pretty obvious that it's bottomed out.   3180 has been a crucial level many times in the past.  This level is also the point of control, which is where most of the volume has occurred in recent history.  These high volume areas are institutional buying.

&amp;#x200B;

We probably should have corrected more this week, at least to the 50 day moving average for SPY.  That would've been healthy, and it seemed like it tried to every day.  If you made money this week, well done, because I definitely got trapped.  Microsoft just kept popping, along with the rest of big tech except for AMZN.  The fact that every dip was bought up like nothing(especially Monday, what the fuck was that shit) means were probably going higher.  But big tech, the linchpin of the financial world right now, is stretched pretty thin with the exception of AMZN.  I think MSFT cools off next week, and AMZN pumps to keep us painfully churning here.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**

**Cortexyme (CRTX)** presents a causative mechanism for **Alzheimer's Disease** (bacterial infection of the brain) that explains amyloid beta 1-42 accumulation, pTau production, and *APOE4* genetic risk factors -- all hallmarks of disease. CRTX is testing a patent-protected, **orally-administered**, first-in-class **small molecule** in a clinical trial to evaluate improvements in **actual cognition** (ADAS-Cog11) not just biomarkers like amyloid. This is significant because small molecules are cheaper and easier to manufacture than biologics like Biogen's Aduhelm and cognition is the gold standard for an effective therapy. CRTX is running a **phase 2/3 clinical trial** with expected readout **no later than mid-November 2021.** Uninformed extrapolation suggests primary endpoint readout could occur as early as **September 30, 2021 (see below)**.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE CALENDAR**

""I certainly think we are saying *no later* than mid-November for sure."" - Chris Lowe, Cortexyme CFO/COO

**Confirmed August 25, 2021 (2:10PM EST): Annual Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease Summit**

Extrapolated LPLV: Approximately August 26, 2021

Extrapolated Database Lock: Approximately September 23, 2021

Extrapolated Statistical Analysis for Primary Endpoints: Approximately September 30, 2021

Extrapolated Specific Analyses for Registrational Trial: Approximately October 21, 2021

**Confirmed November 11, 2021 (1:00-2:30pm EST): CTAD conference participant**

&amp;#x200B;

**THE EXTRAPOLATION: MARKET CAPITALIZATION**

***Share Price = Market Capitalization***

$100 = $2.97 Billion

$200 = $5.9 Billion

$300 = $8.9 Billion

$400 = $11.9 Billion

$500 = $14.8 Billion

$1,000 = $29.7 Billion

$2,000 = $59.3 Billion

$3,000 = $88.9 Billion

**$3,372 = $100 BILLION**

$10,000 = $297 Billion

$16,860 = $500 Billion

Based on Common Stock Issued: 29,655,786 (10-Q, June 30, 2021, Reference 1)

&amp;#x200B;

***Market Capitalization Extrapolation***

Number of Alzheimer's Disease Patients in the United States: 6.2 Million (Reference 2)

Biogen's Aduhelm Price: $56,000 / year (Reference 3) 

Conservatively, let's assume Cortexyme prices at 50% the cost of Biogen ($28,000 / year).

Conservatively, let's assume 75% of Alzheimer's Disease patients qualify for COR388.

6.2 million x 0.75 x $28,000 = **$130.2 billion / year**

Assume valuation at 3X forward earnings and market capitalization is **$390.6 billion\***

\*Importantly, the GAIN phase 2/3 clinical trial is a multi-national trial and Cortexyme management has stated that approval by both US FDA and EU EMA will be immediately pursued. The above analysis values EMA approval for Alzheimer's Disease (phase 3), COR388 periodontitis indications (phase 2), Parkinson's Disease (phase 2-enabling), COR588 (phase 1), and 3CL-pro COVID19 (IND-enabling) pipeline at $0. This is a gross undervaluation, but demonstrates the immense potential for exponential growth based solely on the GAIN trial.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE EXTRAPOLATION: CLINICAL TRIAL MILESTONES**

***Study Completion: Last Patient Last Visit (LPLV) Extrapolation***

March 16, 2020: 300 patients enrolled (Reference 4)

August 14, 2020: 500 patients enrolled (Reference 5)

September 24, 2020: 643 patient enrolled (Reference 6)

August 11, 2021: &lt;100 patients left to completion (Canaccord Genuity Conference)

The duration of a patient's participation is 48 weeks (336 days).

Therefore, 336 days after the September 24, 2020 announcement of 643 enrolled patients indicates the last patient attending the last clinic visit should occur on (and likely before) **August 26, 2021**.

&amp;#x200B;

***Database Lock***

Once LPLV is complete, the database will need to be locked prior to top-line data analysis. This involves LPLV final data entry, complete data monitoring, resolution of all discrepancies, final verification, investigator approval, and final database lock. Average time from LPLV to database lock is 28 days (Reference 7).

Therefore, 28 days after August 26, 2021 is **September 23, 2021**.

&amp;#x200B;

***Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)***

The clinical trial analysis endpoints (Reference 8):    

* Co-Primary Endpoint #1: Mean change in ADAS-Cog11 (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale 11)
* Co-Primary Endpoint #2: ADCS-ADL (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Group - Activities of Daily Living)
* Secondary Endpoint: CDR-SB (Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes)
* Additional Endpoints: Biomarker analysis of saliva, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid for Pg DNA. Winterlight Speech Assessment. MRI volumetric brain measures.

Top-line analysis of co-primary endpoints: Estimated at one week

Intent to treat, specific analysis, and secondary endpoint: Estimated at four weeks

Therefore, one week after September 23, 2021 is **September 30, 2021** for top-line data

Therefore, four weeks after September 23, 2021 is **October 21, 2021** for full dataset

&amp;#x200B;

***Clinical Study Report, New Drug Application (NDA), and Priority Review***

If the GAIN clinical trial meets both co-primary endpoints, Chris Lowe stated at the Canaccord Genuity Conference that Cortexyme has full agreement from the FDA that the GAIN clinical trial will be considered a *pivotal trial*. This registrational study would allow Cortexyme to immediately proceed to NDA submission and potentially receive priority review.

The FDA is required to provide a response to NDA applications within 60 days of submission. If FDA decides the NDA is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, priority review would be completed within six months (standard review within 10 months).

If Cortexyme completes the SAP and Clinical Study Report on the average 83 day timeline, an NDA submission could occur before end of Q4 2021. An 83 day period after the previously estimated database lock on September 23, 2021 is **December 15, 2021**.

Fri, August 20, 2021, 5:43 PM

WASHINGTON, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is aiming to give full approval to Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine on Monday, the New York Times reported [ on Friday.

Regulators were aiming to complete the process by Friday, but were still working through ""a substantial amount of paperwork and negotiation with the company,"" the Times said, citing people familiar with the planning who were not authorized to speak publicly about it.

The agency declined to comment.

It had set an unofficial deadline for approval of around Labor Day on Sept. 6, the report said.

The vaccine was authorized for emergency use in December and more than 203 million people in the United States have so far received it. But none of the three authorized COVID-19 vaccines have received full FDA approval.

The approval could give the vaccination campaign a boost by convincing more unvaccinated Americans that Pfizer's shot is safe and effective and also make local officials more comfortable in implementing vaccine mandates.

Vaccine hesitancy has been a major hurdle to the White House's goal of getting all eligible Americans vaccinated against the novel coronavirus.

BarkBox is the Trojan horse of the Pet Industry.  The competition is paying attention. 
Below is an explanation of BARK with some data that I gathered from my conversation with Matt Meeker, the co-founder of BARK. 
Overview
Barkbox is a brand that is synonymous with dogs and funtertainment gave the monthly subscription box of toys, treats, and chews. Nevertheless, Barkbox gets a reputation as a fad/niche business. A company that started as a hobby/passion for dog owners is now a business with over $500 million in revenues and 2 million subscribers.  I see Barkbox as a trojan horse business where you successfully have 1 product and then extend the line. Apple did this a few times, with computers, then MP3, then phones. Crox did it with their shoe and Deckers Outdoor with the UGG boot; both thrived.  The common denominator was a disciplined management team, a great product, and a strong brand. Barkbox has the common denominator in spades. 
Timeline of Barkbox
Three scrappy entrepreneurs started Barkbox.  They would tinker their product until they would get it right, and many times they would fail, and that is fine, but one thing they noticed was that entertaining the audience and making attractive toys were key selling points.  Sure, there are many treats out there in the industry, but the offer becomes irresistible when you mix toys and treats.  Over time they noticed that they lost subscribers due to a few factors: 1.	How many toys are too many toys?2.	The pet may be getting older and loses interest; it happens. 3.	The dog goes to doggy heavenIn facing these realities, the company had some hard questions to answer.  How many potential customers are there out there that would purchase this subscription?  What other products can we create or sell that allow the customer to stay frequently with us?  
Is Barbox special?
Well, if you own a dog, you probably have heard of them.  Their social media footprint is close to 9 million followers across all platforms. Their angle is entertainment, mixed with practicality and affordability.  The perfect recipe to cater to all generations of dog owners, from young to elderly.  Their toys range from WWE-themed toys to Weed paraphernalia to mainstream-looking toys that attract the mass market shopper at Target, etc. Barkbox is unique because it attracts a demographic similar to Pinterest, as most of the customers are female, more than 75%.  These are the soccer and pageant moms and millennials who choose a dog over having children or at least postponing having children.  This is not just a USA trend, but a global one, accelerated due to COVID as people realized being lonely is not fun and a dog brings all the benefits of companionship and entertainment. Customer opportunity
BARK caters to super fans, which is people who love and are borderline obsessed with their pets.  Although 65 million households in the USA own dogs, I think the market opportunity for BARK’s current subscription box is in the 30% range or 13 million subscribers.  They currently have 1.95 million and over ten years have had an additional 2 million already sign up and cancel, which leaves around 9 million left to go with the CURRENT subscription box offering; when you consider barkeats and barkbright and the other channels, they can keep growing the ecosystem.  The loss of a subscriber is not necessarily bad because if the brand is strong enough, it will get the customer to come back to maybe buy one toy, treat, or home product they are interested in or sign up for BarkBright or BarkEats, so yes they may have lost the $240 annuity. Still, they may be able to get them to buy $50 to $100 a year in other products.   That is less money going to Amazon or Chewy. Customer Revenue Channels

Subscription	Toys and Treats	Super Chewer	Bark Bright	Bark Eats	Combo of 2 of the above or more. 
DTC store – Barkshop.comRetail – Target, Costco, etc.
What is the Barkbox moat?
If I had to sum it up, it would be its ability to listen to its audience and cater to attract products they would be interested in buying or looking forward to in their upcoming shipment. Zappos started selling shoes and became so good at listening to their customer they got acquired by Amazon.  Service matters, and Barkbox has knocked it out of the park compared to peers. 
What did Matt and I talk about? Lots. 
Given my previous conversation with the Investor Relations department, Mike Mougias, I had already cleared up some of the housekeeping questions and wanted to take the time to ask Matt as many questions about the business, obstacles, etc. 

Let me be upfront in saying I have been sending a few e-mails to the management team, and this meeting was supposed to be 30 minutes and ended up being 1 hour. I think we could have gone longer, but I would prefer them to keep growing the business, and I appreciate the time they gave me.  I have also sent them e-mails regarding their interview on Cramer’s show, five pages of notes of their Investor Presentation that needs a lot of work; this may have been one of the reasons there was none after the quarterly earnings report.  My main concern or talking points revolves around the bear thesis, which is that the business model is a fad or niche and will not be sustainable and what is Barkbox’s plan to extend the membership from 16 months to 20, then 24, etc.  
The response I got was that BarkEats would help extend the average price per subscriber and extend the duration. Although I know, that is an easy response we have heard in conference calls and investor meetings, I brought up that changing people’s habits to buy dog food would have to offer a significant value proposition, whether it is a better price or better quality food.  People who routinely shop at Costco or Chewy will not cancel a monthly shipment of dog food so quickly.  I agree that a segment of customers will prefer the convenience of small packages, changing food as the pet matures and set it and forget subscription vs. not having to haul a 30-pound bag of food in a store, etc. However, for the segment of dog owners that aren’t too super fanatical, saving money counts. I explained to them my personal experience of how I buy dog food via Amazon and that the pricing for BarkEats was more expensive per pound, and I failed to grasp the added value of their offering.  They agreed they need to keep working on it, and this is why the BARKEATS has been tinkered with for over a year.  The program was initially launched in April of 2020 and has not grown fast because the company has been tinkering with the offering, or maybe they are seeing that people are not as receptive to it?  Sometimes you have to have the right balance of cynicism and optimism/vision. Could they grow this fast?  Yes, but then what they don’t want is massive cancellations after that, so I am ok with being patient in getting it right, but if the product offering was terrific, we should be pretty close to an actual aggressive launch.   
I then asked if there are any plans for a rewards program?  No, plans.  Now, I think that is a mistake because if you lose 2 million subscribers over ten years, there is a sense of no reward for the loyalty of any kind OR not enough products to warrant a program and pressed further.  How do you expect people to stay longer if you are not rewarding them, get their friends to stay longer, or reward other purchasing behavior outside of the subscription?  It ends up that the company had silo’d a lot of division within the company, and some were resistant to offering discounts on new products released, etc.  So, if I got a subscription and say added a bed, they would not give me a discount, but they would if I would try BarkBright.  They admitted that this was not the best approach and are working on combining or allowing additional benefits to subscribers via some discounting.  Nevertheless, I was disappointed to know there was no plan for a rewards program, and after the e-mail was so bothered by it, I sent a detailed proposal of a plan I think would work for Bark.  

Here is my e-mail below:After the call, I kept thinking of a few ideas on how to help bring back some old members and keep the current ones longer.  I think the best solution is to have the ultimate rewards program for Pets ever made.  Every airline and credit card has one, and why can't dog parents?  So, I thought of BarkBucks.  I know Apple does not have a rewards program or “discount” unless it’s a digital subscription. However, if you consider the cult following of Chik-fil-A, they have a rewards program and still have thousands of customers out the door every day, so I think a good program will go a long way and given your market is primarily women, you have to cater to their needs which is a mix of passion and competitiveness. Like you said, some would get jealous if their box didn't have a toy and someone else did. Below is more or less some brainstorming of how I think it could work at the surface but not sure about the financial impact if, for example, you go back to a subscriber that you lost two years ago that paid for two years and canceled, do you have them come back and give them a Tier below for one year? Perhaps this program works out better when there are more products released?  These are questions you will have the answers to or need to find, but I hope this is helpful to get the ball rolling. BarkBucksThe best loyalty programs are ones that have the following features:·        Competitive environment where higher status gets them more rewards and better deals or better toys?!?!?! Personalized with dog name on them?!?!·        Exclusive discounts to products or storewide.·        Exclusive events or products only sent to those Tiers (this encourages people to want to spend more within the ecosystem vs. chewy; this is why the key to keep launching home products, etc.)·        Allow people to accumulate points to spend on products within the ecosystem, outside of the ecosystem, and share the points with friends and family. ·        Transfer, gift, the points to anyone for a fee.·        Exchange the points for cash (gift card of AMEX, VISA, etc.) You can charge a hefty amount for this.Chik-fil-A has a good program that I think works perfectly for BarkBox, and I thought of more or less how it would work.Tier 110 Points for every dollar spentTier 2Earn 5,000 points in a year (paid $500)Earn 11 points per dollar spentReceive 5% discount at Barkshop.comReceive an additional 5% discount if you sign up for two or more subscriptions of 6 months or more.Tier 3Earn 10,000 Points in a year (spent $1,000)Earn 12 points per dollar spentReceive 10% discount at Barkshop.comReceive an additional 10% discount if you sign up for two or more subscriptions of 6 months or more.Exclusive products or access to products before released to product (use the points to get them)Access to special events in specific cities. Program info:Points expire within 24 months of the last end received.Points can be sent to friends and family as gifts with a 10% fee in matters. So, if they ship 500 points, they are charged 50 points (this helps get some of the “funds” back).Points can be redeemed for products at a rewards page which includes Bark products but also some products outside of it that are DOG specific (it will be the most UNIQUE rewards program in the world for Dogs and maybe even Pets) like working with local groomers small family-owned vets or perhaps a partnership with some companies.
End of e-mail. 
Other topics in the discussion:
Margins.  I asked how much their shipping costs were per box.  They said that $6 per box was a high number, so I am now modeling $5 to $5.50 in my model, which means that the TRUE gross margin with shipping drops to around 45% to 50%, which is still significantly better than Chewy and Amazon. Keep in mind that they sell one of the highest margin products at any retail pet store; this is why they don’t want to open retail stores but keep building a brand akin to Nike. 
Dog Insurance. The management team has spoken about this to investors and has said they do not want to do this. I think the mindset of BARK is the correct one in that it does not want to be the one to tell clients, “Hey, sorry, but we are not covering the vet bill for Sparky due to X, Y, Z factors.” It sounds like a poor customer experience, but in the insurance industry, you sometimes have to reject claims, especially if they suspect them to be fraudulent or abusive. However, there is a way that works for everyone involved in that the company works with an insurance company and collects a flat fee commission for every customer that purchases the policy with BARK. Trupanion paid in 2020 $200 a customer, and I don’t think it is unfeasibly for BARK to get 250,000 customers to choose the insurance option as part of their subscription.  Getting, say, $150 in affiliate commission per customer on year one and, say, $50 every year thereafter brings in 100% gross profit into the business straight to the bottom line, tens of millions per year. Also, it gets the customer to go back to the website to renew, etc. 

Home Products.  The company has launched products at a rapid pace and today has more than 30 products in concept, which means a rollout of around ten that could be rolled out per year as these products need to be tested and sourced economically to be feasible to maintain the 60% or higher margin for the business. This division is probably the most underrated today as this division along with a rewards program, can help extend the life of subscriptions but also get them to stay within the BARK brand of products. 
Conclusion, overall, I walked away confident in the BARK story.  Yes, there is a lot of work they have to do, and that is why you are getting a discount today.  There is a lot of fear, panic, and uncertainty of the business, and I believe over a few quarters of results will show the power of the BARK brand and revenue channels, etc.",Barkbox $bark is a trojan horse for pet industry.

Funny part is that steelmaking is almost their entire source of revenue (**Steelmaking:** 1.4B **Other:** 8m). They fuel steelmaking by using iron ore mined from their own mines.

Here's the rub: they only mine 5.5m tons of iron ore annually (which equates to 3.44m in raw steel). Their **steelmaking capacity is 23 million tons—meaning they need to purchase the rest of the iron ore elsewhere to make all of their revenues.** (steel to iron ore ratio 1:1.6 tons)

Their revenues are focused on construction and the automotive sector INCLUDING retooling facilities—which every company will need to do to produce EVs. And chip shortage will end soon with strong consumers and lots of new vehicles purchased. Not to mention, the trillions of infrastructure spending that will happen in the U.S.—long-term tailwinds for steel prices.

SO, when Cliffs drops because iron ore price decreases—*tendies*.

I can hear you degenerates snickering in the back, ""But what about **hot rolled steel prices now**?"" **They went from 1,000 to 1,900 between January and August—now hovering near the highs.**

Next, let's visit their current debt levels. They had roughly 5.3b in debt with a plan over the next year to reduce it by 1.4 billion. That hinges on FCF (after CAPEX) hitting roughly 350m per quarter (*when steel prices double this is a pretty easy target*).

The end result is a 26% reduction in debt over 12 months, which the CEO said he would do. He also [told analysts they were an embarrassment to their parents and told them they would kill themselves]( if they shorted his stock.

Additionally, they've just finished their repurchase program buying back a total of 10% of their total shares—making yours more valuable. Expect more returns to shareholders, debt reductions, eventual dividends, and a robust steel market with infrastructure spending soon underway.

**TLDR:**

* When iron ore prices go down—Cleveland Cliffs spends less money acquiring iron ore. When iron ore prices go down and the cost of steel goes up, **Jerome Powell lends Cliffs his money printer.**
* Debt is being paid off at an insane rate, which means **more money to return to shareholders** through buybacks/dividend and less debt-servicing expenses.
* Recent buyback program made the **shares worth 10% more than before**.

Pivot Bio now has a valuation of almost $2 billion after raising $430 million.


For the past decade Pivot Bio has been developing proprietary microbial technology which started by mapping trillions of soil microbe interaction and identifying those which are able to fix/convert nitrogen from the air into the soil. They now have microbial technology which can be seeded into the soil that supplies the daily nitrogen requirements of cereal crops, e.g. corn, wheat, rice. 


Normally nitrogen is supplied to crops in the form of anhydrous ammonia. This is primarily created in factory's using the Haber-Bosch process developed by Germany during world war I. It is very green house gas intensive. 


Microbes living in symbiosis with plants to supply the nitrogen they need is based on already existing natural system and is a massive step towards reducing greenhouse gases and more sustainable agriculture. 


BHP

BHP will have spent a total of $12.5 billion to start production of Potassium Chloride/Potash fertilizer in 2027. They have currently spent $5 billion on their mine and will now be spending another $7.5 billion. 
K+Cl-/Potassium Chloride is a fertilizer which was part of the industrial revolution of agriculture. It involves taking a salt applying it to the soil to provide the Potassium plants need. The chloride is secondary. 


As per Carol Viana in her article ""Potassium Chloride mines: climate wold in sheep's clothing"" 


    -high concentrations of chloride negatively affect plant       development due to toxicity. 


    -chloride has a biocidal effect on soil.... as a result this causes loss of soil biodiversity. 


    -soil biodiversity is responsible for several ecosystem sercices, including soil carbon sequestration and the mitigation of greenhouse gases in agriculture. 


It is excellent that one of the most greenhouse gas intensive fertilizer can be replaced, for some crops, with soil microbes. 


It is problematic that the current most commonly used fertilizer to supply potassium comes with chloride and is biocidal to soil microbes.


Regardless as the world is experiencing the effects of climate change the prices of fertilizers are increasing. Governments, producers, and consumers are increasingly reviewing the impact, both positive and negative, that fertilizers, pesticides, and agriculture generally have on the environment.

LUMN is currently trading very close to book value at between $11-12 per share as of time of writing, with earnings per share averaging about $0.40-0.50 per quarter, excluding Q4 where they took a $2 Billion Goodwill impairment. They currently pay a $0.25/share quarterly dividend, for a yield of about 8.5%. The next EX-div is on August 30.

Recently LUMN announced 2 sales consisting of legacy/low-growth assets that make up approximately 20% of their $8.4-8.6B annual EBIDTA. They are giving up $1.7 Billion in EBIDTA for approximately $10.2 Billion in cash. However, if you count the $1.4 Debt that the buyer is taking on, it's effectively $11.6 Billion.

In theory, LUMN could take this $10.2 Billion in proceeds and pay out about $9 per share, covering 75% of the value of the shares, while still remaining profitable with their remaining 80% of EBIDTA and covering their $0.25/quarter dividend.

However, Storey believes the most effective use of this capital is to invest in high-growth Fiber assets, which should grow future earnings, as well as a $1 Billion buyback program over the next 2 years in which the company will be buying shares at a discount to intrinsic value.

Currently the biggest risk LUMN faces has been their approximately $30 Billion in debt and slowly declining revenue, which is the reason the shares are trading at such a low valuation. However, they have been making a lot of progress in both paying down debt and financing it at lower rates the past couple years. In addition, the asset sale consists of their legacy assets, and they intend to focus on growth after the sale.


**Technicals**

LUMN is currently very heavily shorted, with about 10.7 days of trading to cover.  

Last time LUMN saw this level of short interest back in January, where the price temporarily shot up to about $16 during a short squeeze.

For comparison, AMC has just 0.5 days to cover.

LUMN could be due for a short squeeze if the right conditions align.

In addition to the upside, the buyback program should provide some regular price support as the Company seeks good opportunities to buy back shares at a discount.

Arrr matey! Are you ready to begin plundering the high seas with your favourite Israeli shipping company?

$ZIM - ZIM Integrated Shipping Services this week they released their Q2 financials. It was a monster beat. $7.40 eps against $6.05 eps consensus. ZIM reported net income of $888 million for Q2 2021 compared to $25 million in Q2 2020.

Now let's think about this for a second.  They currently have a $4.8billion market cap.  They paid off all their debt and had $650mil net income last quarter and Q2 $888 million. They've put down $1.4B in net profit this year and we're only halfway through the year.

  
Surely this can't continue.. Shipping is going to normalize soon.

&amp;#x200B;

Wrong.  Have fun getting your 2021 Christmas presents in 2022.  You've probably been hearing about it for 6 months now.  Shipping prices are through the roof.  Shipping companies are the most profitable they've ever been? Companies are abandoning containers after finding out the shipping costs are more than the net value of the goods within them. How long can this really last? The rates must be coming down..  




Wrong. When you started hearing about the insanity of shipping prices it was probably around June.  Even Biden came out and said it was unfair that they were making so much money and he would do something about it (narrator: he didn't).  Okay, 2nd quarter in a row with record results, but surely their guidance must have been poor?  




Holy shit! Doubling their guidance. The stock must be exploding!! Nope. ZIM has been in steady decline since releasing the results -- even with a $2 dividend with an ex-dividend Tuesday next week.

Terrible, shallow-researched dribble that gets posted to Wall Street Bets as “Due Diligence” which, in reality, is nothing more than one lunatic’s confirmation bias in long form and projected outward.


Let me take one of these tickers, break down examples of positive things you might hear about it, and explain why they are bullshit.


#The Company


CLNE is a meme stock representing a company, Clean Energy, that is attempting to straddle the line between the fading trend of natural fuels and the EV future of the industry.


#The Nonsense


I have chosen three examples of allegedly bullish signals I have seen posted for CLNE specifically: price targets, partnerships, and options chains.


I feel that these together well cover the types of evidence you might see posted as “DD”.


## Price Targets


The first signal to be addressed happens to be the most meaningless.  
To be blunt, there is a reason they call them “**anal**ists”: most of what they write is pulled right out of someone’s ass. Sometimes this is their own ass, and other times it is someone else’s.  
Not everything has to have an agenda; sometimes you just have a writing deadline.


Bottom line is that some random desk jockey writing that CLNE will be worth somewhere in the mid to high teens does not mean it will ever get there.  
After all, stocks trade based on a company’s current value which means the price is not going to reach ten times what a company might be worth at the end of the century nor will a stock price stay uplifted while a company does nothing but lose money.  
Just look at green energy-adjacent tickers like TSLA or NKLA as good examples of how stock prices tend to reflect an objective valuation of a company.


## Partnerships


Sometimes all it takes to hype a stock is having a partnership with a bigger company announced, or even just having rumors of one coming.  
In CLNE’s case, the partnership is confirmed and it’s with the biggest of the big, Amazon!  
This is huge! Who doesn’t love Amazon?  


…but that is actually a problem. Everyone loves Amazon, and Amazon knows it.  
While having signed a deal with one of the biggest companies on the planet sounds great in a vacuum, talking it up is akin to bragging about getting knocked up by a celebrity while conveniently ignoring the pre-coital contract you signed that specifies that the father does not have to have anything to do with you unless the kid turns out to be somehow profitable.  
Meanwhile, Amazon gets to run around creating more legally deniable baby mamas since, unless CLNE found some leverage to convince the retail behemoth to sign with exclusivity, it is in their best interest to plant as many seeds as they can and only execute on the deals that end up being worth the most.


Let’s look at the CLNE/Amazon deal specifically.  Amazon gets bunch of CLNE warrants for something like $13/share with the chance to get more if they buy $500 million worth of fuel from CLNE.  
The common pro-CLNE read of this situation is that obviously Amazon believes that CLNE will be worth at least $13/share in the not-so-distant future, right? 


Wrong.  


This deal gives Amazon two pretty clear escape hatches:


- Amazon can just choose not to exercise the warrants.


- Amazon can just not buy the fuel.


The entire burden is on CLNE.  
Amazon is under no obligation to do anything. If it does, sure, there’s profit to be made, but the stock market rotates around sure things, not speculation.


## Options Chains


Trying to read an option chain to predict a stock’s trajectory is like trying to use tea leaves to predict your future. Any alignment is better credited to coincidence rather than fate.


For example, CLNE’s max pain for this month’s expiry is currently at $8.  
This is not a cosmic sign of the ticker’s destiny, it is simply a mathematical anomaly created by hundreds of gamblers paying for the privilege to throw a dart at a board. 


Another fortune teller’s tool I have seen rolled out for CLNE and other stocks is looking at open interest for various call strikes and trying to envision them forming a ramp upwards. If such a ramp is found, the argument is that there is some magical price that will cause every single writer to simultaneously hedge all their calls at once, resulting in the price instantly rising to infinity.  


Problem is, that is not how hedging works. Its not even how ramps work, frankly.  
Gamma events are rare because, like real ramps, they require momentum and fear.  
No one writing uncovered calls 100% OTM is rushing to buy thousands of shares just because the underlying price rose 10% in a single day two months out from expiration. They are just going to wait to see what happens which invariably will be the price resettling where it is supposed to be.


In the stock market, the most sure you are that an event will occur, the less likely it is to happen.


# Conclusion

**The Business**:

\- Corsair is not some special acquisition shit. It's in business since 1994

\- It's growing revenue every year. 2018: $937M, 2019: $1,097M, 2020: $1,700M and TTM: $2,015M

\- It's profitable, with a profit margin of 8%

\- It's growing income every year: 2018: $22M, 2019: $24M, 2020: $158M and TTM: $211M

\- They have positive cash flow and are sitting on $136M of cash. TTM free cash flow is $138M.

\- With 91M shares outstanding, this means that they could, theoretically, start paying a dividend of $1 per share without running in debt (which many other companies do). That's a 4% dividend yield for a growing company.

In short, many money, good money 💵 💵 💵

**Share price:**

at time of writing, price is hovering around 25,6, that's more than 40% lower from ATHs.Their P/E ratio is 16. Current S&amp;P 500 P/E ratio is 34.

Look at this beautiful graph and be amazed by my paint skills: there was a strong $30 support until WSB came in with a short pump, after that the price has been regularly falling.

[CRSR Stock Price Chart](

My take on this is:

\- Some boring cuck institutional investors are pulling back and waiting to add more shares. They don't like owning volatile stocks subjects to pumps etc. I will be inserting myself in this sweet stock while they watch from the corner of the room, like the good cucks that they are.

\- Employees and Eagle Tree Capital are selling their shares. They got in pre-ipo, so they are still making a good profit at the price of $25. Some of them are paper-handing it and taking profit. Pathetic.

I know we hate GME comparisons but let's just fantasize for a second:look how after the squeeze, the price kept falling for a while, until it found some volume and skyrocketed back up, to never fall to those levels again.

[GME Stock Price Chart](

In short, apes go to moon 🦍 🦍 🦍 🚀 🚀 🚀

**Other catalysts:**

\- Gaming industry is booming and in case of another lockdown you know what happens

\- Chip shortage means that the sales that we are seeing now are not at full potential- Institutions buying in. At the moment Eagle Tree Capital is still the majority shareholder, after cutting it's position from 92% to 58%. Most other institutions have just a small position (see picture below).

\- Acquisitions. Turtle beach company ($HEAR) was priced around $25 when one of their shareholders proposed acquiring the full stake at $36,5 per share. That's a 46% premium. The company board refused, clearly understanding that the market is underpricing these companies.

This is about the right now fundamentals of the company and how they are set financially. 

Background: If you been living under a rock and only doing all your research on this sub then you need to know that GOTU is a online tutoring education company operating in China and they just got hit with massive sanctions from China basically saying online tutoring can't be for profit and can only operate under certain circumstances and shit like that. In other words, not good for any Chinese education company. 

However, the kicker to this had multiple parts and why Yolo some money on this is a good idea. 

First, short interest is from 35-50% depending on where you get your info. The short interest came in at the drop and has been increasing from that faithful day about 3 weeks ago. Not crazy important but they need to exit at some point. I know this sub likes that kind of stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

Second, they have been giving updates and working with to get their business operating under the China sanctions which is mildly important and what China fully decides will have a lot to do with the future of this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Third and most important factor, the fundamentals currently of the company with the amount of cash on hand and the lack of debt in the company makes it a candidate to liquidate the hell out of the company and pay the shareholders a premium of where it is currently at. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why the third one is really important, is that the company do pay off the debt with cash on hand at it's current price would be twice as much at its current share price. So in other words, insiders liquidate the company get paid twice as much at current share price or they believe China will let them operate at more minimal sanction which will allow them to grow the company. Either way, the share price is way to low for the future of the company.

NO you don’t. So let me tell you.

Amazon always engages in overly aggressive competitive behavior by lowering prices at a loss just to take out any competition. Some say that’s a monopoly…..🤪

This is obviously bad news for CHWY, but what you don’t know is that Amazon may be a bully, but this is a story of David vs Goliath.

CHWY has been crushing earnings after earnings and the stock price has been increasing, while AMZN loving retards have been trying to short the stock in hopes that Amazon will crush them. The current short interest is 16.25% which is not the highest, but it’s been increasing.

&amp;#x200B;

As a general thesis, I believe the tech market (growth tech, although mostly focused on large growth) has 3 likely outcomes in the coming 2-5 years. A general market recession would mitigate this thesis as what falls in a recession is somewhat of a crapshoot (yes, I know certain things people need during recessions, is it a new iphone or macbook? Probably not, but they have other growth avenues outside of fancy hardware.

**Option 1**

Tech experience compound growth due to size. This is frankly my favored avenue the tech sector will take. There are a lot of acquisitions in the space, which is essentially less-risk R&amp;D, imo. Essentially, you're outsourcing specific branches of R&amp;D to 100 start-ups all aiming to address a major problem.

The size also includes infrastructure. Although storage is growing at a rapid rate, there is infinite data, essentially. So, the powerhouse nature of these large growth tech stocks will continue to expand with this \*\*massive\*\* head start.

**Option 2**

Tech is curbed by anti-trust and regulation. We've seen in before in financials and other sectors with specific anti-trust and regulation legislature. There's an inkling, a very evident one, of bipartisan support for tech legislature. Who knows about a tech tax - it's happening in Europe, but who knows if it will be appeasing to the voters and both parties. Old, grumpy politicians - from both sides of the aisle - do not know how to use an iPhone, let alone understand the complexities of legislature in the tech space.

**Option 3**

Tech scales and levels the playing field. It sounds ironic to say, but the innovation in the tech space has been relatively centralized as of late (Tesla, Apple, Alphabet, etc.), however, I do believe there is a time in the short to mid horizon where the ""knowledge"" transfer from mega tech to start-up tech is going to increase at a rapid rate. This would potentially bolster small growth over large growth, but I do believe there will be a natural brain drain from mega tech which will synthesize into an explosion of tech start-ups with significant backing.

Obviously, this trend is happening and has been happening for sometime. I simply believe there will be an uptick and shock to typical FAANG investors who have seen explosive growth since the Great Recession.

Frankly, I'm an asexual, low-cost ETF holder with aggressive tilts in the portfolio, rather than an active investor, but I'd be interested to hear y'alls view of mega tech in the coming years.

\---

TL:DR 3 options:

1. Large growth tech continues to boom (60%)
2. Regulation and the damn commies slow large growth and general tech (30%)
3. Tech becomes more equal across the spectrum, shifting gains from large growth to other areas of the market (10%)",3-way fork for tech sector,6,4

While I do love throwing money away on memes to fund the hedge fund manager's bastard son's third yatch he fucks my girlfriend on, I do also like to find something that'll make me some money in order to afford tissues to wipe my tears. One of those right now at this current price point is $CLNE.

We might think $CLNE is a meme and pump/squeeze play that famed WSB, but it is not. It got some hype because Apes got word of the low public float and saw that it had some short percentage of around 10% of public float and thought they wanted to buy cow farts that signed a deal with Amazon. So they bought the hell out of it just to watch HFs come in and short it to death from $20 to where its at now \~$6.60.

At the current price the market cap of the company is about $1.49B making it a nice value. You might say, ""will it go moon?"". Then I'll reply, ""take the crayon out of your mouth, close your mouth when you breathe, and hold on until the end my good friend.""

$CLNE all you need to know is that they sell fuel, a special kind of fuel that is made from waste that lowers emissions. This fuel already has an infrastructure and is a cheaper and more scalable transition than other energy sources and is the only one that is carbon negative, not just carbon neutral. The company already has signed deals to distribute the fuel to companies and local governments. More recently they signed a few deals for 26M gallons which is about 25% of their quarterly numbers put out in Q2 of 2021 which increased by 13% year over year. Not only are they signing deals to provide fuel, they are also being awarded contracts to build RNG stations that are worth millions. The thing about RNG is that the existing infrastructure is limited and needs expanding. This brings me into the infrastructure bill that has allotted $30B in funding to expand renewable fuels infrastructure. $30B is 20x the current market cap, but won't all be directly awarded to $CLNE. While $CLNE is the market leader in this emerging energy space the government won't hand it out just to them to fund the actual infrastructure for it.

Now we get into the value. Current market cap sits at $1.49B, best numbers I have found for total assets hover around $1B-$900M depending on the source. Total liability sits at $100M. So worst case we have a total share holder equity of $800M with TO INCLUDE DEBT! This isn't some black magic accounting scheme where they have piles of debt and turn it into assets on books to get a desirable P/B ratio. $800M equity which includes over $254M in cash and short term investments which is up 70% from last quarter. So we have an unleveraged 1.86 P/B ratio. This might not seem like much, but this is one of the only cash positive, unleveraged, and profitable small cap companies in all of energy not just renewable energy with that low of a P/B. Not to mention they are pioneering the market.

So the company looks good on the books, year over year growth, future growth and a mega catalysts in the infrastructure bill. Something that does need to be addressed was Q2 revenue numbers which is due to $79M in revenue allotted to Amazon Warrants. Without the warrants revenue would be above $79M and cost to operate would be significantly lower.

For my mouth breathing brethren looking for moons and quick gains in a market that is murdering poor souls left and right: This is not just a meme stock, but it can be squeezed with 10% of public float being short, only 150M in public free float, and 2.6 days to cover. However, that is outside of the scope of the DD...

Just to share my alternate DD, not on projections but valuations. How is Paysafe so much undervalued compared to other spacs. Bill Foley took paysafe public at a valuation of 9B with 4B debt. This valuation was conservative as Paysafe did not have any growth in 2020 due to Covid.

2B of the money was used to pay the debt which means investors got a good deal at $10 with market cap at 7B. Which means either Bill Foley paid 2 billion more or blackstone received 2 billion less. Either way, investors got a 2B discount. Fast forward to now, the market cap is at 6 billion with revised upwards guidance for the year at 1.55b compared to 1.5b, with 23% growth excluding divested business. This is impressive as in just over a year, they grew from 0 growth to 23% growth and increasing their operating income margins from 10+% to over 30%, helping them to their first ever net positive income quarter.

However, as we know shorts attacked it just as any SPACS. What separates it from other SPACS was the valuation initially at 9B was already undervalued unlike many clean energy SPACS which has lofty valuation and unrealistic projections. Paysafe was projected base on 0 growth in 2020, and a mere 10% annual growth.

Furthermore, given many recent fintech acquisition such as square acquiring of afterpay is upwards of 20x revenue. FB and Paypal have both indicate they see the digital wallet segment as a game changer, whereby Paysafe is already a established player in the segment for 10 years and is still further growing due to igaming. Microvision being a rumored acquisition for microsoft sustain its p/s ratio at over 800. In comparision, Paysafe p/s ratio is now under 4. I can assure you NONE of the SPACS out there has a p/s ratio under 10, with POSITIVE NET INCOME. 

The last confirmation that their stock is undervalued is management decision to acquire pagoefectivo and paysafety in an all cash deal as compared to recent acquisitions made by draftkings and square using solely stocks.

So why such a steep drop. It was up 10% premarket initially due to earnings beat. Look what I found. AGAIN SHORTS ARE COMING. Short interest is at 5% at 17M already reported at JULY 30TH with around 50% short volume daily. IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY BY NOW. DAILY volume on average is 4m which means any squeeze would require shorts 4 days to cover. THEY HAVE TO BUY AT LEAST 4 DAYS WORTH OF THE ENTIRE FLOAT TO COVER, JUST LIKE ANY OTHER SHORT SQUEEZES. 17m more shares already floating around. Share price would rocket further if shorts are forced to cover. PLUS many in the wsb community have already entered prior and are diamond handling now.

I am sure everyone have seen different analysis all putting its target price from 15 upwards to 45. USING BELOW EXAMPLE, THEY HAVE GROWTH, VALUATIONS, FINANCIALS TO BACK THE SQUEEZE WHERE NO INSTI WILL EXIT. Those who would, would have already exited. This is the best short squeeze play around in my opinion as shorts blindly attack it cause its a SPAC. 

Looking at a larger basket of comps with a collective growth rate of \~12.5% (not far from Paysafe’s minimum 10.6% projection) here are valuations based on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign among others:

Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09

EV/Rev ratio : $83.91

EV/FCF ratio : $87.86

Average: $97.95

After eliminating outliers with highest multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75

EV/Rev ratio : $44.64

EV/FCF ratio : $44.18

Average :$46.52

Notes:

1. Unlike Paysafe, around half of these competitors report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow.
2. Used low end of Paysafe's projections and factored in debt and high-end of potential dilution.
3. As noted Paysafe’s 10.6% rev growth projection excludes planned inorganic M&amp;A growth and projected 55% CAGR iGaming growth, which constitutes a third of their revenue.
4. The above comps were taken during a sector-wide pull-back and do not reflect recent fintech gains since Jamie Dimon’s ""enormous competitive threats"" comment.

This is not any financial advice, but I am just a nerd that all in on Paysafe at 8.2. Only when we unite, we become stronger and earn from short sellers.

Basically, all your favorite Federal Reserve Board members are going to sit in a circle and play with each others dicks, while talking about when to **TAPER**. This has been the main narrative driving the market recently, so it's pretty important. 

The contents of this meeting will provide important insight to the FOMC meeting - when they could actually hike rates - [in late September]( In all likelihood, the market is going to try and price in what will happen then based on what happens next week.

If you've ever traded during or just before/after an FOMC meeting then you know what that means. Tons of whipsaw action back and forth - and basically everyone gets fucked. Although, it doesn't start until Thursday, so maybe we get a few days of no bullshit.

Take this as a warning to play it a bit safe, maybe save yoloing your parents savings on FDs for the week after. I know you retards will do the opposite, but at least now you can feel special for knowing what you are getting into and doing it anyway.

I personally have no clue how the fuck it's going to go, considering those dickheads change their minds more often than WSB loses money on shitty small caps, so I'm going to lay low.

10 - VIX $22 PUT 9/15

100 - VIX $23 PUT 9/15

450 - VIX $19 PUT 9/08



Even the most smooth brained, crayola breath autists can look at this graph of the VIX and see a pattern:

&amp;#x200B;



Whenever it shoots up, it comes back down! Volatility is a mean reverting measurement. Even if the market continues going down, once the trend is established, the volatility goes down. Particularly in the last few months we can see that when volatility goes above 20 it comes down.

&amp;#x200B;



But past performance isn't indicative of future performance!! That's exactly right so we must factor in what other market environment variables changed. We had the fed minutes of the last meeting released this week. IMO and for many people who have been paying attention to the fed and the taper discussions, this doesn't present anything new.  I believe as do many investors that tapering is good for the economy and the stock market because too much liquidity is as dangerous as too little. We don't want run away inflation and we want the fed to take their foot off the gas. Notably this is not equivalent to the fed putting on the brakes which in this analogy would be hiking interest rates.  Now even though tapering will be good for the economy and stock market in the long run there will for sure be some recalibration in terms of multiples, etc. as we converge to new prices. Could be higher, could be lower, but imo the baseline won't be too different from where we are because earnings have been amazing and there's justification to these prices given that rates are low. I don't think the early tapering will increase rates enough that there will be a huge ""taper tantrum"" as there was years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

So where does that leave us? We've got a panic sell (if you even consider a 2.5% drop to be panic) but the underlying economy and market is sound. I don't know how long before we come back to ATHs but I do know the dust WILL settle and VIX will eventually go down. My bet is that VIX goes down within a month which is very reasonable given past performance in similar environment (the july 19 spike in vix was due to the same taper discussion).

Will try to hold for 40% profit but may sell before next friday because of Fed Jackson Hole Meeting.

Simply put (lol), either WISH bounces from this level and we can call that it's new support OR it goes lower and hits that trend line below $4 (TIMBER).

I think there is a psychological level at $5 and wish won't go below it in my personal opinion. It also lines up nicely with the lower price targets out there.

I'm an Autist with a Golden Retriever, and I want to share with you a piece of ancient history.

We've seen quite an uptick of loss porn today—YOLOs that went wrong.

But the truth is, that's not something new. Similar situations have occurred throughout history and all around the globe.

Let me take you back over a thousand years ago, to a place in northern Tibet called Chungpachi.

The son of a Red Sect Lama was a well-known mantra practitioner and made a fortune with his incantations and exorcisms.

One day, he was called upon to face a rather fierce spirit.

After a long battle, when the demon was defeated, it let out a cry:

""Mi la, Mi la."" The man adopted the sound as his clan's new title. And his descendants came to be known as Mila.

Fast forward several years, one of the exorcist's grandsons had a son—Mila Dorje Sengge—who enjoyed gambling. He was the best dice thrower in town, winning every time. And feeling invincible, he sought new challenges.

That's when a wandering man (perhaps a demon in disguise) showed up in town and invited Mila Dorje for a game of dice.

On the first day, the wandering man made a small bet and intentionally lost. But on the second day, he easily defeated Mila Dorje.

Never having experienced such a loss, Mila Dorje was upset and dared the wandering man for more rounds.

Mila Dorje won the third, fourth, and fifth days—feeling invincible once again. But that's what the wandering man wanted, and he said,

""Mila Dorje! I have lost every day these last few days, so I propose that tomorrow we both bet all our property, livestock, land, wool, money, and jewelry. With the villagers as witnesses, we will sign an agreement for a final battle, and neither of us is allowed to go back on it, no matter who wins. Do you want to do it?""

Mila Dorje agreed without hesitation.

The next day, all the villagers showed up because they all wanted to see loss porn.

In the end, Mila Dorje lost everything. He left town and was eventually able to resettle in a small village called Kyangatsa. From there, Mila Dorje started a business, transporting wool to sell in the winter and trading livestock with nomads in the summer. Eventually, he amassed a new fortune, formed a family, and his grandson became Milarepa, now regarded as one of Tibet's most famous yogis.

Granted, Milarepa is the most recognized name from that family tree. But out of many ascendants, it is Mila Dorje who left his mark in history. Even without Reddit, his YOLO story was shared and told throughout the land.

Ok, now it's time for me to groom my dog.

Have a wonderful day.

TL;DR 1: It's embedded in our DNA to YOLO.

TL;DR 2: From that time and place, the only person worth mentioning in any books is the guy who YOLO'ed everything and lost.",YOLOs Through the Ages | From Mila Dorje Sengge to WSB,13,6

Why this discussion is still short? How long should I put it in words?

&amp;#x200B;

My suggestions:

(1) So pull the price to 7.51 BY TOMORROW then BARK will go to $9 next week

(2) If I am correct, BUY STOCKS this week, not OPTIONS, because stocks can raise the price in these two days.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:08/19 5pm

(1) Q: Why the ""Open Interest"" for $7.5 call is much smaller than it for $10 or $12.5 but I still think $7.51 is important?

A: If the price cannot go below $7.50 this week, someone (hedge funds?) may want to buy the stock now to prevent gamma squeeze. Because BARK has a SMALL MARKET CAP, this means its price may go up quickly in a day. So that's why I am seeing $7.5+ options, but only $7.5 alone.

(2) Q: What if BARK does not go above $7.5 and I am wrong?

A: That surely could happen. But BARK at this price, you understand it.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:08/20

Its price goes up and down quite very fast. Something will happen TODAY.

Wed, August 18, 2021, 4:27 PM·

(Bloomberg) -- Move over Moderna Inc., Pfizer Inc. is the new day traders’ favorite Covid-19 vaccine stock.

Pfizer climbed about 9% in the the four trading days through Tuesday, with retail traders snapping up about $63 million of the shares on Tuesday alone, according to data from Vanda Research. The day-trading crowd sold off more positions than they bought in Moderna and BioNTech.

It marks a sharp change in fortunes. Both Moderna and BioNTech have amassed triple digit gains this year, a rally the nearly $280 billion-valued Pfizer missed out on with a scant 34% gain, despite being the first -- along with BioNTech -- to win authorization for a Covid shot in the U.S. The U.S. announced today that it would start offering booster shots to the already vaccinated in September.

As Pfizer rallies, BioNTech has tumbled more than 18% from a record high reached on Aug. 9, while Moderna is down roughly 18% from its zenith. All three stocks slumped today, with Pfizer reversing early gains to close down 2.2%.

Pfizer’s stock now trades at about an 8% premium to the average analyst price target, compared to more than 30% for Moderna and 18% for BioNTech.

The recent closing of the gap may not spell the end of the rally. Wall Street is already adjusting its models with Pfizer getting a new Wall Street high price target of $61 from Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Louise Chen on Tuesday.

Are you tired of losing money on weekly options because you cant read a chart? Yeah, I know you are.

Here's one simple trick: learn to read a chart. Yes, these crayons seem to just be lines over a chart and spy only go up haha brrr. That is not the case. Indicators tell a story on when money will move in nd out of a security. SPY is a great chart for TA, because it works. SPY breaks ATH's every other day but yet you're constantly -80% on your 3DTE 450C.

As you know spy got absolutely hammered today, but if you go back the last 3 months SPY has drilled to earths core. On the 18th. Every single time. For the last 3 months. Last month in July the market was not open the 18th, so we drilled on the 19th. You get the point though. 

May 18th: SPY Open: 415.80, Close 411.94

June 18th: SPY gapped down from 421.97 (6/17 Close), Open:  417.09, Close: 414.92

July 19th: Open: 426.19, Close: 424.97

August 18th: Open: 442.96, Close: 439.21 

""So, what you're saying is every 18th MM's, Algo's, JPOW, Bears, or the Taliban seem to push it down?!"" No. Retard. It seems every 18th (or next trading day if 18th is a weekend) SPY tests its 50-day MA. (moving average). 

I wont get technical, but basically the 50MA is the closing price of the last 50 days added up divided by 50. 

Today was the 18th, yet we did not test the 50 day moving average. So, of course that means it will get tested tomorrow, today was rough enough. Buckle up for tomorrow. Do not rush to buy 2DTE 443 calls tomorrow at open. 

The currents 50-day MA seems to be hovering around 433-434. (50-day Simple MA= 433.37) (50-day Exponential MA= 433.91)

So it is possible we will see SPY drop to 433-435 before rebounding to ATH and printing calls as usual. This would be a great time to get into calls. but make sure it bounces off of this moving average first before getting into calls. If it manages to drill right past that 433-434 area, it is possible we could see SPY trading around 425. If you have calls and would like to save yourself from your  ~~asshole~~ Portfolio being gaped, I suggest you wait for this level to be tested. I'm getting rid of my calls at open, buying puts to make back the gains from my calls that will gap down tomorrow, sell at the bounce, and purchase more calls. 

My positions: 4x 08/23 444c, 2x 08/23 444c, x2 08/27 445c, 1x 08/27 BABA 167.5p (not related, but BABA puts have been free money since July). Edit: I sold 446/447 calls against my calls so I had downside protection.

Will be getting rid of my calls, day trading puts down to that level, then switch to calls once I see the rebound: or alternatively we break the 433 level and drill to the 420's and I ride the puts down.  

Tomorrow at close you will come back and thank me from saving your portfolio, from none other than yourself. When you see that I am not a retard, you will enjoy my next post on why PFE will put me in a Ferrari next month.

&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Stop being a retard and learn to read a chart. don't buy calls tomorrow until SPY tests the 50-day Moving Average at 433.37-433.91, then get into calls. If SPY manages to break 433, load the boat with puts and hold on to your tapered shorts, shit will get messy tomorrow and you will be forced to ask your boss for an advance on your paycheck.","Listen up SPY call holders, we will receive another grand gaping tomorrow.

For those already spending tendies on defense, you should know that the sector is relatively concentrated (like you probably were on Tiffany ""tight-ass"" in the 6th grade).

MRCY is the pusher man of other defense company's electronic components and almost 1/2 of its revenue is generated from sales to LMT, LHX, NOC and RTX.

KTOS has hypersonic UAS - taking drones straight into plaid. More than 70% of its sales come directly from Uncle Sam in the US DoD.

The sector performance has been mixed thus far in 2021 - kinda like the jagerbombs you made from your parents liquor stock.

So what does this mean? The largest defense stonks are on DISCOUNT. LMT trades for 13x estimated 2022 earnings while MCRY trades at 18x estimated 2022 earnings. KTOS looks the most expensive for about 42x that number. The other 3 trade for close to 16x earnings. Comparing these to .SPX they trade for about 20x estimated 2022 earnings.

Analysts LIKE defense stonks and so should apes. The lowest Buy-rating ratio for any of those six stonks is 60%. The average Buy-rating ratio for stonks in .SPX is about 55%. RTX and NOC are Wall Street pin-up models with more than 80% and 70%. NOICE!

Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I’ve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I’m aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren’t technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022 be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we’ll get to those in a bit) in the near future.

AAL

I think this a buy stock because reasonably undervalued right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta’s market cap is higher than every airline’s besides Southwest, but Delta’s yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up’s (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL’s). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn’t an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small. Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL’s has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I’d love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn’t legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own American Airlines shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either.

They made 348mil in 1 quarter -_-, and expecting to grow. This is a big growth stock. They are projected to make 1.38bil this year, and it’s valued only at 2.13bil.

To put it into prospective, chipotle’s market cap is ~52bil, and that’s with they’re last year’s revenue of ~6bil. The market cap is almost 9x the revenue. Domino’s market cap is ~19bil and they made ~4.1bil revenue in 2020. That’s almost 4x. Krispy Kreme will make at least ~1.3bil for fiscal 2020, and it’s trading at 1.6x, not even double. Hell, even shake shack is worth ~3.6bil and they only made ~594mil in 2019, that’s almost 6x. Let’s even compare their closet competitor in the market, Starbucks. They made est. 19bil in 2020, with est. market cap 136bil. That’s ~7x. 

The reason why they missed eps by .01 was because the cost of the ipo price was costing them(according to a market watch article that I can’t post because it will automatically remove my post)

This is obviously naked shorted af and undervalued. The market cap should be valued AT LEAST 3x it’s revenue. Hell, it’s even doing better than most tech companies.

In my humble opinion as an ape, this is the market being retarded.

Some of the gloom stems from the EPS miss this past quarter. But the reason for that EPS miss is the best reason you could ever have: they had more revenue.

You see, most of their costs are upfront, and incurred when they install the solar panels. Once a solar panel is installed, they continue to recognize the revenue without much more costs. As the CEO said in their conference call, the surge in costs was one-time.

Perusing through the earnings transcript (  ), the executives basically told Julien Smith, the BoA analyst, that they will have “significant” free cash flow generation in the coming quarters.


There is no reason not to buy:
- technicals support a bounce up
- every analyst on the street has a PT of $56 or more.
- executives are hyping their performance a lot
- lots of upsell opportunities with their Ford F150 partnership
- major hedge funds are taking unusually large positions in this (see Viking and Jericho)

They have higher revenue than $uber $snap $rblx and many more, on top of that $COIN is also profitable while most other growing tech companies still are not profitable! Remember profits? It used to be something business actually started for: ""to make money, i. e profit. 

The mind blowing thing is that $COIN growth is much more than other tech companies that have two or three times its valuation (triple digit growth y/y)

Why? Why is it that other tech companies are valued so much more than an actual business that makes money. The answer is a bit long. 

First, it's the way $COIN went public. Institutions weren't able to steal a big portion of the stock. Only 25% of their stock is held by institutions, compared to 60%+ of other big IPOs in tech. The banks aren't kin on $COIN by misrepresenting their business model and valuating it based on price of the coin that shall remain unnamed. That's a sham they are using to discredit an industry that is threatening their existence. I hate this comparison, but banks are taxi companies claiming Uber drivers will get lost and how much better and more convenient it's to take a taxi. $UBER had to fight municipal governments at time cause they were lobbied by taxi companies, and $COIN has a bigger and tougher battle since banks have the FED and federal government in their pockets, but winning this battle will be more rewarding. Digital currency, and I don't mean unofficial government coins, any form of it that's even generated by government, is coming and no one is better positioned to take advantage of that than $COIN. 

$COIN real business is digital transfer of currency for big institution and corporation and they are growing their client in that regards. They are the only licensed company that can do that in most country (like Germany). They are also building a huge ecosystem on top of DeFi. They are not the simple exchange for retail investors at banks would like to present them. 

I think a few factor for their price being low is that institutions will like to keep gobbling more while ppl let go at loss. Banks have higher margin for them than most other tech companies with riskier position ($COIN profit and cash in hand is enough to start paying dividend and be operational for a decade). Also the high price of stock isn't attracting a lot of retail investors cause they like more unit rather than more value, which is a misconception in investment and a lot of ppl made that mistake with $AMZN.

I can go on, but I rather what other retards here think.

Viacom CBS is one of the biggest mass media conglomerates in the world. It was formed after the merger of CBS and Viacom in 2019. It owns Paramount pictures, manages over 170 networks, such as Nickelodeon and Comedy Central and has begun a move towards online streaming with youtube channels and its Paramount Plus streaming service.

**Why $VIAC's price is so low right now**
In the recent weeks, $VIAC price crashed over 56.33%. For those who aren’t aware, this decrease was caused by 3 factors :

* Viacom announced a 3 billion dollar stock sale causing a 23.2% crash
* Investors downgraded Viacom’s stock
* Archegos Capital Management was forced to liquidate its position in Viacom CBS, causing an additional 27% plunge in the price of viac shares

It is certain that the crash is now over, as the price has retested support at the 38.5 price level over 4 times, indicating that on technicals the price is highly unlikely to go down

There are several reasons why Viacom CBS is a good long term buy
* The P/E ratio of $VIAC is incredibly low at 7.85
* The company is cutting cables and moving towards streaming, and its growth in subscribers has been consistently surpassing estimates (in their latest earnings, it gained nearly double what even the circlejerk people on r/viac estimated)
* Viacom CBS’s earnings have experienced steady growth in 2020, from $516M in Q1 to $810M in Q4
* Viacom CBS increased operating cash flow from $1171M in 2019 to $2215M in 2020
* In a digital era, Viacom CBS has also been moving in the right direction with its online streaming services, it gained 30M new global streaming subscribers last year and Global streaming &amp; digital video revenue increased 71% year-over-year to $888M
* In Q4, CBS was the most-watched network in Daytime and Late Night and claimed the quarter’s top drama, news magazine and 4 of the top 5 comedies, as well as the top new comedy series

Why buy now?
$VIAC is a phenomenal company for long term aspects, however without catalysts the price was pinned by market makers at max pain. Now however, two catalyst events have happened which have both caused 6% increases on the days they occured. Firstly, their most recent earnings had a phemomenal number of new subscribers, secondly they just announced a crazy deal: comcast and viac are making a streaming service for europe with 50-50 investment in the project. With the shared marketing of these two media giants and their large volume of content, this will absolutely explode  revenues, and as a second major catalyst with a confirmed reaction, this is gonna create a breakout.

TLDR :

$VIAC is a strong company at a crazy discount which has just experienced the mother of all catalysts. 🦧🚀🚀🚀

As today Nvidia will present their fundamentals for Q2 2021, we expect a significantly grow in earnings, most likely the expectations will be crushed, as AMD did 3 weeks ago.

Corona\`s main economic impact is the increased need of electronic chips especially high computing power like GPU.

For those who don\`t know, there is an absolute chip shortage in the market right now. Auto chips, to new consoles, and any kind of electronics.

Nvidia as the current market leader in the area of GPU is expanding in all diffrent kinds of business not only gaming but as artificial intelligence, machine learning, cloud computing, big data and/or the greater use of data through 5G, which is probably leading to exponential growth in those young markets.

Nvidia spent 3.92 billion U.S. dollars on research and development in their 2021 fiscal year, an increase from the 2.83 billion U.S. dollars that was spent  on R&amp;D in 2020.

Nvidia is not only a good bet in going short, but will probably going upwards in mid and especially in long term.

**Valuation: Undervalued**

**Investment Thesis:**

· With more and more states passing legislation, and making sports betting legal, there is a big opportunity for sports betting and gambling stocks to take advantage of.

   o The companies who move the quickest will enjoy a first mover advantage and capture large  
amounts of market share.

· With a large variety of sports betting and gambling stocks in the market, which one is best positioned for large growth, and to become a leader in the National market?

   o I believe that this is Penn for many reasons, which will be discussed throughout this analysis.

· $PENN – Penn National Gaming is expanding rapidly and has plans to continue their expansion in the American gaming space. Furthermore, they have numerous macroeconomic factors that they can take advantage of to accelerate their growth.

**Company Overview:**

[Penn National Gamming ($PENN)]( owns and manages several gaming and racing properties, retail sports betting operations, online sports betting operations, and video gaming terminal (VGT) operations.

In February of 2020, Penn National purchased a 36% equity interest in “Barstool Sports Inc.” which is a leading digital sports, entertainment, media, and lifestyle brand. Barstool sports is very popular among the younger demographics and expands Penn’s total market and target demographics. Barstool and Penn entered into an agreement where Barstool will promote Penn’s sportsbook, and iGaming products through the “Barstool Sportsbook” mobile app.

Penn National Gaming looks to continue expanding and evolving their operations in order to become an omni-channel provider of retail/online gaming, and sports betting.

**Investment Information:**

*Macroeconomic Outlook:*

*Sports Betting:*

Since 1992, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) made competitive sports betting illegal in most states. However, in 2018, the PASPA was overturned by the Supreme Court and all states are now allowed to legalize sports betting.

Some states have already passed legislation and have made sports betting egal (and live). These states include Oregon, Nevada, North Dakota, Montana, Colorado, New Mexico, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, North Carolina, West Virginia, Virginia, New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire.

Additionally, there are some states that have made sports betting legal, however, sports betting operations are not yet live in their state. These states include Washington, Arizona, Wyoming, South Dakota, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Louisiana, Florida, Maryland, and Connecticut.

Lastly, there are some stated that are in the legislative process of making sports betting legal. These states include Ohio, and Massachusetts.

All of the other states are yet to make a move to legalize sports betting.

The full legalization of sports betting in the 22 aforementioned states have opened new business and expansion opportunities for companies that operate in the gaming space. The companies who integrate into these states, and has the best User Experience, Customer Service, and reach, will be able to take over these states and enjoy a first mover advantage that could benefit them for years, decades, or even centuries.

Furthermore, the state who have legalized sports betting, but are yet to have active sports betting operations also represent a large business/expansion opportunity. These states will not have as much competition out of the gate (as the states that have already fully legalized sports betting). This should help sports betting companies to gain market share quickly and enjoy the first mover advantage.

As a result of the large interest/legalization of sports betting, a research study conducted by Gabelli Securities (in partnership with the US Census Bureau) estimated that the US sports betting industry will grow to $10.1B by 2028, which assumes a CAGR of over 25% (currently the sports betting industry is valued at $2.1B).

The Barstool Sportsbook was created to take advantage of the legalization of sports betting and the large business opportunity that comes with it. Currently, the Barstool Sportsbook is available in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Colorado, and Indiana.

Furthermore, the Barstool sportsbook is looking to launch in Virginia (in the next couple of weeks), Arizona (Fall 2021), Maryland (Fall 2021), and maybe even Canada (in 2022, which will be talked about later).

*Retail/Online Gaming:*

The COVID-19 pandemic had two large impacts on the US gambling market. Firstly, the retail gambling market in America suffered due to the pandemic, as many states restricted the use of casino’s due to the lockdown measured that they put in place to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. This was catastrophic to many retail casinos and unfortunately caused some of them to close their doors permanently. Conversely, the COVID-19 pandemic helped out the online gaming industry greatly. This was due to people converting from retail casinos to online casinos due to the closure of the retail casinos.

However, with many lockdown measures being lifted and many retail casinos re-opening their doors, how will the US retail and online gaming industry perform over the next couple of years?

Some reports are estimating the industry to grow at a CAGR of 17.3% over the next 5 years. This is due to their belief that people will go back to the casinos and revive the retail industry, while the online gaming industry continues to grow.

*Acquisitions:*

*Barstool Sports:*

In February of 2020, Penn National Gaming closed their acquisition of “Barstool Sports”. Penn initially acquired 36% of Barstool for $161.2M and has committed to purchasing an additional 14% of their business for $62M over the next 3 years. The deal would conclude with Penn National Gaming owning 50% of Barstool in Feb 2023 for the purchase price of $223.2M, valuing Barstool at $446.4M.

Part of this acquisition included an exclusive partnership between Barstool Sports and Penn National gaming for up to 40 years. This partnership also allows Penn National to use the Barstool Sports brand to promote their online and retail sports betting, and iGaming products.

In September of 2020 (7 months after the acquisitions) Penn National, in partnership with Barstool Sports, launched the “Barstool Sportsbook” which is a sports betting app that uses the Barstool Sports name, and targets their demographic. The Barstool Sportsbook launched in Pennsylvania in Sept 2021 and has expanded to Michigan in January 2021.

Penn National Gaming believes that their partnership/acquisition of Barstool Sports reflects their strategy of evolution/expansions, to help them meet their goal of becoming the Nations largest gaming operator and omni-channel gaming and betting provider.

*The Score:*

Recently (Aug 5th 2021), Penn National Gaming acquired “Score Media and Gaming”, which is a leading digital media and sports betting technology company. Penn National Gaming acquired 100% of Score, In return for $2B.

This acquisition proves Penn National Gaming’s desire to become the largest player in the industry in a big way, as they have set their sights on an international expansion into Canada. Penn has noted the significant opportunity that Ontario brings to the table and believes that their acquisition can help them to penetrate the Ontarian gaming industry. Ontario would be the 5th largest jurisdiction for gaming in all of North America and contributes largely to the $4+B opportunity that Canada has to offer.

Penn National highlights the ability for Score to seamlessly connect Penn’s sports content and betting operations and help to monetize their highly engaged user base. Penn believes that integrating the Score’s data, analytics, tracking, odds, betting, and content will help them to improve margins. Lastly, Penn National Gaming has an optimistic long-term outlook on the impact that the Score will bring, estimating long-term revenues from this acquisition to reach $900M annually.

Many people have also speculated that the Barstool Sportsbook will be able to integrate into Canadian provinces and territories through this acquisition. If this is Penn’s plan, it shows their level of thought behind their acquisitions, and their exceptional talent for finding synergetic acquisitions.

*Financial Information:*

· **Financial Performance (Good):** Penn received a tax benefit of $165M, they experienced a $29.2M gain on disposing their assets, their depreciation expense fell by 11.5%, and they increased their cash position by 323.8%.

· **Financial Performance (Bad):** Over the course of 2020, Penn’s total revenues fell by 32.5%, they experienced a net loss of $670M, their adjusted EBITDA fell by 45.5%, and their operating expenses only decreased by 15.6% (far less than the decrease in revenues).

· **Stock-Based Compensation Arrangements:** In 2020, Penn National issued 4,475,908 common shares as part of their compensation plans. These shares had a dilutionary effect of 3.86% on the previously existing shares.

· **Common Stock Offerings:** In 2020, Penn National offered 35,266,667 common shares to the market as a common stock offering. These shares were offered in order to help Penn National to grow and launch their “Barstool Sportsbook” sports betting application. These shares had a dilutionary effect of 30.4%.

· **Barstool Sports Preferred Stock:** In 2020, Penn National gave Barstool 883 preferred shares, which had a value of $23.1M at the time of the offering. Each of the Series D preferred stocks that Barstool received is redeemable for 1,000 common shares. These preferred shares are convertible according to a 4-year conversion plan. In total, Barstool will be receiving 883,000 shares over 4 years, equalling 220,750 common shares/year. This would have a yearly dilutionary effect of roughly 0.2%.

*Valuation Information:*

*WACC:*

I was able to find Penn’s WACC through my own WACC models. By inputting the necessary information, I found Penn’s WACC to be 8.87%.

*CAGR (2021-2025):*

I was able to find the forecasted CAGR over the next 5 years to be 29%. I did this through looking Penn’s forecasted financial performances from analysts, and by looking at Penn’s previous financial performances.

*CAGR (2030):*

Penn simply cannot grow by 29% yearly forever as a result I estimated their CAGR in 2030 to be 5% (which is rather low). I then tapered Penn’s growth by deducting 5 percentage points off of the CAGR yearly until 2029.

*Perpetual Growth (Risk Free Rate):*

I was able to find Penn’s Risk-Free Rate in their SEC 10-K filing, in which they estimated this figure to be 1.55%. This 1.55% was used to forecast their yearly growth after 2030.

*Operating Expense Increase Rate:*

I was able to find Penn’s operating expense increase rate to be 20% through taking the average growth rate of their operating expense over the past 5 years.

*Interest Expense Increase Rate:*

I was able to find Penn’s interest expense increase rate to be 4.5% by taking their average growth rate over the past 5 years.

*Depreciation and Amortization Increase Rate:*

I was able to find Penn’s depreciation and amortization increase rate to be 6.5% by taking their average growth rate over the past 5 years.

*Tax Rate:*

I was able to find Penn’s 2020 effective tax rate in their SEC 10-K filing. In 2020, Penn’s tax rate was 19.8%, I used this 19.8% for their tax rate through 2030.

*Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) Growth Rate:*

I was able to find the CAPEX increase rate to be 9% through taking Penn’s CAPEX growth rate over the past 5 years.

**Investment Valuation:**

*DCF:*

I was able to undergo my DCF model by using the information found above in the “valuation information” section of this report. By incorporating this information, I was able to find Penn’s fair value to be $199/share, which implies an upside to this investment of 190%. This valuation is rather high, so I decided to also undergo 3 comparable analyses to see if this valuation persisted.

*Comparable Analyses:*

*P/B:*

By comparing Penn’s P/B ratio to their competitors (found above in the “competition” section of this report), I found Penn’s fair value to be $134/share, which implies an upside of 95%. This valuation is not quite as high, but still indicates that Penn is very undervalued.

*EV/Revenue:*

By comparing Penn’s EV/Revenue multiple to their competitors, I found Penn’s fair value to be $83.06/share, which implies an upside of 21%. This estimate is by far the lowest that I have had thus far, however it still indicates that Penn is undervalued.

*EV/EBITDA:*

By comparing Penn’s EV/EBITDA multiple to that of their competitors, I found Penn’s fair value to be $90/share, which implies an upside of 32%. This valuation also indicates that Penn is undervalued.

Average Comparable:

I took the average result from the 3 comparable analyses that I underwent. I did this because the results were scattered, and I wanted one clear valuation based off of the comparable analyses. I took a weighted average weighing the P/B comparable at 20% weight, and the EV/Revenue &amp; EV/EBITDA comparable analyses at 40% weight. By doing this I arrived at a final comparable valuation of $96/share, which implies an upside of 40%.

**Plan:**

My plan for an investment into $PENN – Penn National Gaming, would look something like this.

· Enter into a position into Penn below $70/share

· Sell 50% of my position when $PENN hits $96/share (comparable valuation)

· Sell the remaining 50% when $PENN reaches $148/share (average total valuation)

**Risks:**

· **Financial Performance:** In 2020, Penn did not have a good financial performance. Tis is de in large part to the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic had on their retail operations. Furthermore, during this time they also acquired Barstool, which also had a negative impact on their overall financial performance. If Penn is not able to bounce back in 2021, despite states re-opening, then investors may start to get worried and liquidate their positions.

· **Share Dilution:** In 2020, Penn suffered from a large amount of share dilution. This was due to their Barstool acquisition, and their share offerings so that they could launch products under the Barstool brand. This dilution is not worrying, as long as this level of dilution is a one-time occurrence, this is because they were using the funds received from the offering to fund projects that would help them to expand and generate more revenues in the future. However, if this level of dilution continues, I would be very worried for the future of their stock price.

**Catalysts:**

· **Financial Performance:** Penn’s 202 financial performance was very poor. However, if they are able to bounce back in 2021, they will be able to spark a new sense of hope/optimism in their investors and prove to investors that they are financially healthy. Their earnings report this year are very important to their share price and are something to keep an eye on as an investor.

· **Acquisitions:** Historically, when Penn has acquired companies, their stock price has benefited from the news of the acquisition breaking. This is true when Penn acquired the score, as their share price went up 10% the following trading day. This was also true when Penn acquired Barstool Sports, as their stock price increased by over 10% the following trading day. Penn has stated that they are committed to continuing their growth, so future acquisition may be on the cards, and should help boost the Penn stock.

· **Legalization of Sports Betting:** As more states break the news that they are fully legalizing sports betting and starting operations, or if they are passing legislation to make sports betting legal, Penn will benefit from this news. This is especially true if they announce that they will be expanding their operations to that/those state(s).",Sell me this $PENN (Penn National Gaming Analysis),43,7

Many of you are familiar with US cannabis legalization process. You probably bought into companies, enjoyed some crazy rides or left hanging the bag.

The **prospect for US legalization is uncertain** but I want to point your attention to **one big and seemingly unrelated event: what's happening in Afghanistan**.   


**FACT: Afghanistan is the global top supplier of drugs (incl. cannabis)**  
Afghanistan is the top producer of heroin. More importantly for this DD, Afghanistan is also likely the top producer of illegal cannabis. Picture below (source: UN) ranks it as #2 but is likely an underestimation: much of the illegal cannabis reportedly sourced from Pakistan/Lebanon/Spain/other is actually coming from Afghanistan.



**THESIS: The US will rather legalize than increase import of illegal cannabis from Talibans**  
With the NATO leaving Afghanistan, drug production is likely going to increase. If the US government takes no action, some of it is likely to flow to the US. This will inevitably put pressure on legalization. **Would the US government prefer its citizens to buy homegrown (and taxed) cannabis, or finance the Taliban regime by buying its cannabis?**

# TLDR: Great time to buy cannabis stocks

What exactly? Up to you, this DD is not about individual companies. For transparency I personally like and own positions in ETFs (MSO) and selected US players both small (e.g. CHALF) and large (e.g. CRLBF). Given this DD, I am now going to increase my positions.

Obviously, no financial advise, just my thoughts, let me know yours!

Keeping in mind that a lower percentage change and lower deviation from the estimation is better in this context, the following are the YoY CPI data + the estimations:

USD: 5.4% (Est: 5.3%)
CAD: 3.7% (Est: 3.4%)
GBP: 3.8% (Est: 3.6%)

Now here is the Eurozone and AUD

EUR: 0.7% (Est: 0.7%)
AUD: 0.5% (Est: 0.5%)

Not only is the inflation rate far lower, but the estimations are accurate, meaning all the CPI were expected and indicative of stability. Last week when the US CPI data listed above was released, it caused a sharp rise in EUR/USD as the USD value keeps getting lower.



As of now, the USD is inflating at a rate comparable to 2008, which explains the record high cost of living and booming house prices. To add to this, the US government is spending like crazy and not making up for it in taxes, meaning they’re spending money they don’t have (printing money). It was just yesterday that an extra US$500m was authorised for Afghan refugee relocation funding, and the recent house infrastructure and public service spending has been through the roof, causing the US debt to vertically flatline. There is no such spending in the Eurozone or Australia. Could these (especially the Euro) be potential hedges against the USD within the next few years if spending continues at the same rate?

In the scheme of things, the sell-off is to be expected after the recent streak of relentless rises. There was general unease due to the panicky scenes of evacuation in Afghanistan but then news of continued crackdowns on online companies by China to ensure fair competition and a case of Covid found in supposedly Covid-free New Zealand set off the sudden risk aversion selling. 

With the harsh and immediate response from the NZ government to put the whole country into a lockdown upon discovery of just one case, the NZ Dollar sold off hard (more than 1%) and stock futures started to trade lower. To put things in perspective, sure, a lockdown in NZ will affect the NZ economy, but it’s not really going to have that big of an impact on the global economy. 

Though it’s unfortunate that no country seems to be safe from the delta strain, the major economies (US, China, Europe) are already facing the harsh realities of delta strain. Should the major stock markets be affected by yet another confirmation that it is more infectious and that we are not out of the woods? 

As we have always said, bull markets are made when they are walls of worries to climb. For a while there, it seemed that it was getting a bit too smooth-sailing and there was nothing for the bears to harp on about. 

So, a minor correction, a welcome bump in volatility, and a few more worries to add to the wall. Big picture, nothing changes and if, at all, this would likely make the Federal Reserve think twice about starting their tapering soon.",Why is the market suddenly jittery?,103,8

# **The Dao of Capital**

- &amp;quot;The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy.&amp;quot; Hazlet
- &amp;quot;You have to love to lose money and hate to make money to be successful&amp;quot; Klopp
- Far better to avoid direct, head-on competition and instead, pursue the roundabout path toward an intermediate step that leads to an eventual position of advantage
- Natural systems – from forests to markets – continuously seek balance.
- Austrian investing takes a roundabout path to market success by pursuing immediate loss during the investment process so you can gain more advantageously in the future.
- If investors could use history to predict market movements, they&amp;#39;d never be surprised by them or lose huge amounts of money.
- The market cannot be understood as predictable and law-abiding since it&amp;#39;s unpredictable and chaotic at its core.
- The roundabout – the pain of positioning and paying now for the advantage and payoff later – only works when we remove our temporal blinders that keep us hyper focused in the moment. Then, and only then, can we pursue those proximal aims intended to give us an intermediate advantage from which the distal ends are more easily and effectively achieved. To say this is extremely challenging is an understatement.
- To succeed with the strategy of Austrian Investing, you must be able to tolerate initial setbacks.
- A system should naturally achieve balance through internal guidance. Attempts to intervene in the system will usually cause more problems than they solve. The Austrian School of Economics believes this about markets: government intervention doesn&amp;#39;t help balance markets, it distorts them.
- We can only succeed with Austrian investing if we can stop focusing on the short term. This is extremely difficult, but it&amp;#39;s also critical to our success in the long run. It&amp;#39;s hard because humans are designed to prefer things that benefit them now rather than later.
  - This is part of our evolution as humans; we had to focus on immediate threats in order to survive and thrive as a species. Our culture also teaches us that the moment is all that matters—we live in an instant gratification society where people want everything right now without having to work hard for it or wait long periods of time (such as saving money).
- Patience is the most precious treasure
  - Most people are unable to take the roundabout route because our evolution and desire for the here and now (Like the children in the marshmallow study, 1 now or 2 later). Therein lies an edge to the Austrian investor who can take the roundabout approach
  - The reason for this difficulty can be found in our wiring, those genetic tracings of our evolutionary journey rooted in survival, when overlooking immediate needs was reckless and life-threatening.
- Without a functioning feedback loop, the system goes haywire like a faulty thermostat
- The Federal Reserves attempts at &amp;quot;Fire Suppression&amp;quot; leads inevitably to bigger and more deadly &amp;quot;Forest Fires&amp;quot;
- Austrians believe in the &amp;quot;boom and bust cycle&amp;quot; where artificially low interest rates foster an unsustainable boom (characterized by overleveraged borrowers investing in operating capital that will be unproductive at natural interest rates) and the inevitable bust.
- Markets tend to experience infrequent, large moves or &amp;quot;fat tails&amp;quot;
- Wall Street&amp;#39;s problem is one of lost opportunity; you MUST go for it now or you won&amp;#39;t have a chance tomorrow. This causes Wall Street traders to focus on the now

- You can&amp;#39;t time the market. IE – Pick tops and bottoms.
- Short term doesn&amp;#39;t matter
- When interest rates are low, bonds are not as negative correlated as you would like with equities and not as much of a safe haven. Do not chase yields
- The federal reserve will have difficulty &amp;quot;normalizing rates&amp;quot;
- Alpha (inefficiencies) is difficult to capture for investors
  - The question you have to ask yourself is &amp;quot;Can you be more efficient than the market?&amp;quot; NO
- We don&amp;#39;t know how the next recession will play out ahead of time. Cover your contingencies. Don&amp;#39;t just plan for one.
- Don&amp;#39;t fight the fed. IE – Shorting risk assets
- In a crash, almost all asset correlation goes to 1
  - Diversification in that scenario won&amp;#39;t protect your portfolio
- If you are in the derivatives market (IE – ETNs), you are taking credit risk from the issuer
- 2 types of safe havens. Nothing else is a safe haven.
  - Insurance (Left tail way OTM 30% puts)
    - Does very well in a crash
    - small loss during up market
    - has a high degree of confidence (not a lot of &amp;quot;noise&amp;quot;)
  - Store of Value (Gold)
    - does ok in a crash
    - up/down during an up market
    - has a high degree of confidence
    - No counter party risk
- Safe Haven imposters - vulnerable in a crash, needs a lot of luck for that safe haven to pay off in a crash. Have a low degree of confidence it will pay off during a crash
  - Unsafe Haven
    - Hedge funds
    - long/short equity fund (can&amp;#39;t time correctly)
    - High dividend stocks
    - REITs
    - Commodity index
  - Hopeful Haven
    - Value stocks
    - 10 - year bonds
    - VIX (difficult to time and it will punish you severely during a up market)
    - Silver
- The federal reserve low interest rates are causing investors to chase yield and creating distortions in the market
- You want to have money for when the liquidation of this malinvestment occurs so you can buy cheap equities
- Precious Metals/Gold are a great store of value
- Focus on your &amp;quot;dry powder&amp;quot;

- Investing in the stock market is a good idea, but you have to be careful. When interest rates are too low and there&amp;#39;s too much money being printed by central banks, it can lead to malinvestment. Malinvestment is when people invest in things that aren&amp;#39;t useful or valuable for society. That leads to crashes in the market.
  - Distorted markets are prone to crashes
  - So, stay out of them and wait for the distortions to pass before investing again.
- Tobin&amp;#39;s Q (Misesian Stationary index) is a good measure of stock valuations. Market is fair valued at 1
  - It is the ratio of the market value of the companies/replacement cost of those business or total US corporate equity/total US corporate net worth. Lower number is better. High was 2.15 in 2000. 2021 is 2.75
- Tobin&amp;#39;s Q has a direct inverse correlation with future stock returns. Higher number = lower returns. When financial markets are distorted, they carry the seeds of their own destruction. The inevitable bust that follows the boom is not an unexpected event.
- Basic premise is to stay out of the market for long periods of time when distortions are running high and wait for the inevitable collapse to purchase cheap equities. The objective of roundabout investing is not to make money now, but to position ourselves for better investment opportunities later
- The challenge to the Misesian strategy is that it requires contrarian thinking, to &amp;quot;zig&amp;quot; when the rest of the world is &amp;quot;zagging&amp;quot;. You have to step back when the MS Index is high so you can act like a corporate raider when it is low
- Explosive Left Tail risk hedging (what Mark does) is very difficult for the average investor or even professional. Don&amp;#39;t try it
- For the average retail investor, Cash is good when Tobins Q is high so you have &amp;quot;dry powder&amp;quot; for the inevitable collapse. You don&amp;#39;t want to be shorting the market or in risk assets. This is difficult because you will watch the market go up while you are setting on the sidelines
- Benjamin Graham – &amp;quot;Many shall be restored that now are fallen and many shall fall that now are in honor.&amp;quot;



# **Nassim Taleb**

# **Fooled by Randomness**

- Survivorship Bias means you don&amp;#39;t hear from the losers on a topic, you only hear from the winners.
  - Watch out judging a person by their results because history will only show you the winners. You won&amp;#39;t hear the stories of the losers
- Over short terms, you see variance, not returns. Don&amp;#39;t monitor your portfolio on a daily basis
- AFTER an event has occurred, it is easy to make a story as to why it happened and why people should have seen it. But it is difficult to see in advance BEFORE it happens
  - Events are more random than we think
- Negative pangs cause a 2.5x more emotional response than a positive one
- It is not how likely an event is to happen that matters, it is how much is made or lost when it happens that should be the consideration
  - Maximize your profit expectancy, not probability
- I try to benefit from &amp;quot;rare events&amp;quot;, events that do not tend to repeat themselves frequently
- I believe that rare events are not fairly valued, and that the rarer the event, the more undervalued it will be in price
- Investors for pure emotional reasons, will be drawn into strategies that experience rare but large variations.
- Pascal&amp;#39;s Wager – The optimal strategy for humans is to believe in God because if God does exist the believer will be rewarded and if he doesn&amp;#39;t exist, the believer has nothing to lose.
  - IE - Inequality of outcomes, don&amp;#39;t try to pick up nickels in front of a train
- There is no point in searching for patterns that are available to everyone; once detected, they would be self-canceling
- &amp;quot;One cannot judge a performance in any given field by the results, but by the costs of the alternative (i.e. if history played out in a different way). Such substitutes courses of events are called alternative histories. Cleary the quality of a decision cannot be solely judged based on its outcome.
- Past events will always look less random than they were (hindsight bias)
- Probability almost never presents itself as a mathematical problem or brain teaser
- No one accepts randomness in their success, only in their failure
- Take into account the costs of mistakes
- Bad information is worse than no information at all
- 5 traits of a Market Fool
  - Overestimating accuracy of data or overconfidence
  - Getting married to positions
  - Changing story

# **The Black Swan**

- 3 attributes for a black swan
  - A black swan is an outlier, as in outside the realm of regular expectations
  - Carries extreme impact
  - Human nature makes us concoct explanations for its occurrence _ **after** _ the fact
    - Rare, Extreme Impact and Retrospective predictability
- There are great problems with trying to forecast the future, given limited knowledge of the past
- Black swans being unpredictable, we need to adjust to their existence rather than naively try to predict them
- The human mind suffers from 3 ailments as it comes into contact with history
  - The illusion of understanding or how everyone thinks they know what is going on in a world that is more complicated (or random) than they realize
  - Retrospective distortion or how we assess matter only after the fact (history seems clearer and more organized in books than in empirical reality)
  - Overvaluation of factual information
- Taleb realized that he was totally incapable of predicting market prices, but that others were just as incapable as him but did not know it or did not know that they were taking massive risks. Most traders were just picking up pennies in front of a steamroller
- 2 types of randomness analogy
  - Mediocristan – land of average
  - Extremistan – land of black swans
    - Mediocristan - When your sample is large; no single instance will significantly change the aggregate or total. The largest observation will remain impressive, but insignificant to the sum. IE – Human weights, Human heights, car accidents, IQ
      - Black swans don&amp;#39;t occur here. Once you collect enough data should reveal all you need to know and if you do have a surprise, it won&amp;#39;t be consequential. Collecting data here is ok. What you can learn from data in Mediocristan augments very rapidly with the supply of information. You can predict here.
    - Extemistan – inequalities are such that one single observation can disproportionately impact the aggregate or the total. IE – wealth, income, book sales per author, financial markets, commodity prices, inflation rates, economic data
      - Black swans do occur here. You will have trouble figuring out the average from any sample since it can depend so much on one single observation. Be suspicious of the knowledge of the data you collect here. Knowledge here grows slowly and erratically with the addition of data. Difficult or even impossible to predict.
- Black Swan Example – Consider a turkey that is fed every day. Every single feeding will firm up the bird&amp;#39;s belief that it is the general rule of life to be fed every day by friendly humans &amp;quot;looking out for my best interests&amp;quot;. But the Wednesday before Thanksgiving something unexpected will happen to the turkey. It will occur a revision of belief. Ironically, the turkeys feeling of safety had reached a maximum when the risk was the highest.
  - The turkey had &amp;quot;learned backwards&amp;quot; from observation
  - oHow can we know the future, given finite knowledge of the past?
  - Something may have worked in the past until, well it doesn&amp;#39;t. You don&amp;#39;t drive your car looking in the rear-view mirror.
    - Before 1987, the biggest single day drop in the Dow was 13% so some people incorrectly concluded from the past that they most the Dow could drop in a day was 13%. It dropped 22% on &amp;quot;Black Monday&amp;quot;
- Positive Black Swans take time to show their effects while negative black swans happen very quickly
- Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence
- Naïve Empiricism – We tend to have a tendency to look for instances that confirm our story and our vision of the world and these instances are easy to find. You take past instances that corroborate your theories and treat them as evidence.
- Negative Empiricism - The way to counter your Naïve Empiricism is to understand that a series of corroborative facts is not _Necessarily_ evidence. Seeing White Swans does not confirm the nonexistence of Black Swans.
- The error of confirmation - We are quick to draw conclusions from what we have seen to what is unseen.
- Confirmation Bias – our natural tendency to look only for corroboration of our ideas.
  - To counter this George Soros was known when taking a financial bet to keep looking for evidence or instances to prove his initial theory wrong
- Narrative Fallacy – this is associated with our vulnerability to overinterpretation and our predilection for compact stories over raw truths. It severely distorts our mental representation of the world, especially rare events
  - We tend to look at sequences of facts and weave them into an explanation. Explanations bind these facts together. Making them easy to remember. They help us make more sense of the facts. Because our brains can&amp;#39;t store all that information. Stories stick, statistics don&amp;#39;t
    - The more you summarize, the more order you put in, the less randomness. The same condition that makes us simplify pushes us to think that the world is less random that it actually is.
- In some strategies, you gamble dollars to win a succession of pennies while appearing to be winning all the time. In other strategies, you risk a succession of pennies to win dollars. In other words, you bet either that the black swan will or won&amp;#39;t happen. These require completely different mind sets.
  - Most people have a preference for number 1
  - Some bets in which one wins big but infrequently, yet loses small but frequently, are worth making if others are suckers for them and if you have the personal and intellectual stamina
- We favor the narrated. We are not manufactured to understand abstract matters, we need context. Randomness and uncertainty are abstractions. We respect what has happened, ignoring what could have happened.
- Our ideas are sticky: once we produce a theory, we are not likely to change our minds. When you develop your opinions on the basis of weak evidence, you will have difficulty interpreting subsequent information that contradicts these opinions. So those who delay developing their theories are better off
- We humans are the victims of an asymmetry in the perception of random events. We attribute our success to our skills, and our failures to external events outside our control, namely to randomness. We feel responsible for the good, but not for the bad.
- Taleb&amp;#39;s Perfect World – &amp;quot;Think of someone heavily introspective, tortured by the awareness of his own ignorance. He lacks the courage of the idiot, yet has the rare guts to say &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know.&amp;quot; He does not mind looking like a fool. He hesitates, he will not commit, and he agonizes over the consequences of being wrong. He introspects, introspects, and introspects until he reaches physical and mental exhaustion. This does not mean he lacks confidence, only that he holds his own knowledge to be suspect.
- Louis Pasteur – &amp;quot;Luck favors the prepared&amp;quot;
- The black swan asymmetry allows you to be confident about what is wrong, not about what you believe is right
- So, what to do if you can&amp;#39;t predict in a world with Black Swans??
  - Avoid unnecessary dependence on large scale harmful predictions. Be fooled in small matters, not large. Example – don&amp;#39;t accept the government forecast for SS payments 50 years from now.
  - Do not listen to economic forecasters or to predictions
  - Be prepared! Be prepared for all relevant eventualities
  - People are often ashamed of losses, so they engage in strategies that produce very little volatility but contain the risk of large loss.
  - Barbell Strategy
    - Be as hyper-conservative and hyper-aggressive and you can instead of being mildly aggressive or conservative
    - Put 80-90% in extremely safe investments – (Example – T-Bills)
    - Put the other 10-20% in extremely speculative investments (Example – VC)
    - You have no risk on one side and high risk on the other, which equals out to medium risk. This minimizes your risk of negative black swans and exposures you to positive black swans
    - Put yourself in situations where favorable consequences are much larger than unfavorable ones
    - I am very aggressive when I can gain exposure to positive Black Swans and very conservative when I am under threat from a negative Black Swan","Mark Spitznagel/Nassim Taleb Book Summaries. The Dao of Capital, Fooled by Randomness, The Black Swan",72,2

# **Jason Zweig Your Money and Your Brain**

- Neuroeconomics
  - A monetary loss or gain causes a biological change that has profound physical effects on the body
  - Neural activity of someone making money in investments are indistinguishable from someone high on cocaine
  - After 2 repetitions of a stimulus, the human brain automatically, unconsciously, and uncontrollably expects a 3 repetition
  - Once people conclude that an investment return is predictable, their brains respond with alarm if the pattern is broken
  - Financial loss is processed in the same areas where we respond to mortal danger
  - Anticipating a gain and actually receiving it are expressed in different areas. Helps explain why money does not buy happiness
  - Expecting both good and bad events is often more intense than experiencing them
- Greed
  - There is only one sure thing on Wall Street. And this is there are NO sure things
  - Lightning seldom strikes twice
  - Lock up your &amp;quot;Mad Money&amp;quot; and throw away the key. If you can&amp;#39;t stop yourself from gambling in the market, then limit the amount
  - Control your cues. Turn off CNBC
  - Think twice before making any decisions. Calm yourself down
- Prediction
  - Our incorrigible search for patterns leads us to assume that order exists where there is non
  - Whenever you are confronted with anything random, you WILL search for patterns in it
  - People hate randomness
  - If a reward is big enough, it will carry a long-lasting memory that is difficult to break. This is why chart analysts get into trouble because they think they &amp;quot;got it&amp;quot;
  - Investors have a recency bias – what has happened they think will continue to happen, even if it is unpredictable. This causes investors to think that a bull market will continue and a bear market will also. This also causes them to buy the hottest mutual funds
  - Control what you can in the market – don&amp;#39;t look for the next Google
    - Expectations – set realistic goals
    - Risk – ask not how much you can gain, but also how much you can lose
    - Readiness – think twice
    - Expenses – keep them low
    - Commissions – keep them low too
    - Taxes – don&amp;#39;t day trade, you get hit with short term taxes
    - Yourself – don&amp;#39;t try to predict
  - Don&amp;#39;t try to predict the market – DCA is a good strategy to prevent this
  - Most mutual fund managers fail to beat the market. Answer to this is to DCA into index mutual funds
  - Correlation is not causation
  - Take a break – if you take a break, it resets your &amp;quot;gamblers fallacy&amp;quot; IE – a coin is flipped 7 times and comes up heads 7 times in a row, the next flip is &amp;quot;due&amp;quot; for a tail.
  - Don&amp;#39;t obsess – if owning stocks is a long-term project for you, then following changes constantly is a very, very bad idea.
- Confidence
  - Create a &amp;quot;too hard&amp;quot; pile. Know what you don&amp;#39;t know.
  - Measure 2x cut 1x. Have an overconfidence discount of 25% so if a stock according to your valuation is worth between $40-60. Make it $30-45.
  - Don&amp;#39;t get stuck on your own companies&amp;#39; stock
  - Diversification is the best defense
- Risk
  - Take a time out. Do not buy or sell an investment on the spur of the moment
  - When the price drops, so does risk.
  - Try to prove yourself wrong. Listen to another person&amp;#39;s opinion
  - Know yourself and your risk tolerance
- Surprise
  - If everyone knows something. It is already embedded in the price of the stock
  - High hopes can cause big trouble
- Regret
  - Expecting regret often hurts worse than experiencing it
  - The more you can automate your investing, the better
  - Face your loss.
  - If you have a truly diversified portfolio, then you will guarantee yourself, by definition, that some of your assets will do well while some will do badly. You have to look at the whole portfolio
  - Don&amp;#39;t chase hot sectors or stocks. The cure for chasing is to rebalance. Decide on a number and stick with it
  - Rebalancing over the long-term increases returns and lowers risks. It is buying low and selling high
- Happiness
  - If you earn enough cash to live on. Then more money won&amp;#39;t make you happier
  - Know that money is a means, not an end in itself
- Summary
  - Take a global view. Look at total net worth, not changes in each holding
  - Hope for the best but expect the worst. Diversifying can keep you from panicking during bad times which will occur
  - Investigate before you invest. A stock isn&amp;#39;t just a price. It is a company
  - Never say always. Never put more than 10% of your investments into a single stock
  - Know what you don&amp;#39;t know.
  - The past is not the prologue. What goes up must come down and what goes way up usually comes down with a crunch. Never buy an investment because it is going up. Smart investors buy low and sell high
  - If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Anyone who offers a high return at low risk is probably a fraud
  - Costs are killers. Trading costs eat up your profits
  - Don&amp;#39;t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread out between US, foreign, bonds, and cash. It is not a good idea to invest heavily in industries that your job is tied too. If you lose your job, your stock would be likely to fall also.

# **Edward Chancellor Devil Take the Hindmost A History of Financial Speculation**

- After fiat money was introduced in Rome during the 3rd century A.D, currency crises became common
- Journalist Mike Royko described the market as manic-depressive. All you have to do is listen to the daily broadcasts and you think you are hearing the latest medical report on someone who ought to be in therapy or tied to a bed.
- Bull phase – market is frenetic and expectations become unrealistic
- Bear phase – market is depressed, activity is slow and universal pessimism replaces universal optimism
- Ben Graham – In the short term, the market is a voting machine, in the long term, a weighing machine
  - **Dutch Tulip Crisis**
- During Tulipomania there was little attempt to justify the prices paid for tulips, most speculators entered into contracts with the intention of quickly selling at a higher price
- The Tulip market crashed on February 3, 1637. There was no clear reason for the panic
- In the aftermath of the tulip crisis, tulipomania gave way to tulip phobia – a revulsion analogous to the public distaste for common stocks after the crash of 1929 and Japan after 1989
- The course of the tulip mania was similar to many later crashes. Initially started with a rise in prices for the precious Semper Augustus bulbs which attracted new entrants into the market, so stock market booms are commonly triggered by a sharp climb in the share prices of a particular sector.
- As a bull market mania progresses, the quality of the stocks (or tulips) that attract speculation declines – a rising tide floats all ships, even those unseaworthy. Rumors fuel the boom, rapid growth of leverage through the use of futures and credit, sharply rising prices followed by sudden panic without cause and initial government passivity followed by intervention
- Austrian economist J.A Schumpeter observed that speculative manias commonly occur at the inception of a new industry or technology when people overestimate the potential gains and too much capital is attracted to new ventures
- John Stewart Mill said the seeds of each boom are sown during the preceding crisis, when the liquidation of credit causes asset prices to decline so severely that they become genuine bargains. Their subsequent sharp rise from a low-level lead to a revival of speculation. Unable to remember the past, investors are doomed to repeat it
  - **Stockjobbing in Change Alley London**
- Charles Kindleberger suggests that speculative manias typically commence with a displacement which excites speculative interest. The displacement may come either from an entirely new object of investment or from the increased profitability of established investments. It is followed by a positive feedback loop as rising share prices induce inexperienced investors to enter the market, and results in euphoria. Speculation becomes more diffuse and spreads to different classes of assets. New companies are floated, investors leverage their gains, credit becomes overextended, swindling and fraud are common, then the economy enters a period of financial distress which is the prelude to the onset of a crisis
- The success of legitimate Captain Philips diving expedition and the East India Company caused promotors to cash in on investor euphoria to float new ventures which were fraudulent
- The mania played out as a series of mini-bubbles. Shares were driven above their intrinsic values by speculators using financial derivatives (futures, options, credit). The boom lost momentum after expectations were disappointing and business failed.
- An impatience to be rich, a contempt for those slow but sure gains which are proper reward of industry, patience and thrift, spread though society
  - **South Sea Scheme**
- Sir Isaac Newton – &amp;quot;I can calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies, but not the madness of men.&amp;quot;
- There was a company stock floated (IPO) during the bubble which said &amp;quot;For carrying on an undertaking of great advantage but no one to know what it is.&amp;quot;
- Only 4 of 190 bubble companies founded in 1720 survived
- Speculators did not buy bubble companies shares as long-term investments, they bought them with the intention of selling them on to greater fools
- Many buyers of the stock knew they were purchasing at absurd prices and that the long-term prospects of the company were hopeless; however, they all believed or hoped that they would be able to sell before the price plummeted
- Joseph Schumpeter – &amp;quot;The mania of 1720 was exactly as were later manias of this kind, induced by a preceding period of innovation which transformed the economic structure and upset the preexisting state of things.&amp;quot;
- The South Sea Company bribed both the Court and Parliament.
  - **Fool&amp;#39;s Gold**
- The most common practice of projectors seeking to promote their companies was to employ members of Parliament and their peers as directors
- Emerging market speculation tends to appear at a juncture in the economic cycle when declining yields on domestic bonds combine with an excess of capital to make foreign investments particularly attractive.
- The boom of 1822-1825 can be understood as the product of easy credit conditions
- During the boom, the unrestricted growth of credit caused asset prices to rise, stimulating further credit creation. The situation reached a turning point in the spring of 1825, after which declining asset prices undermined confidence, caused a contraction of credit, and eventually brought on a crisis.
- When owners of savings are not finding their usual kind of investments, they rush into anything that promises speciously, and when they find that these specious investments can be disposed of at a high profit, the rush into them more and more.
- During the upturn in the cycle, people become convinced the prosperity will last forever.
- After 1825, there was a succession of booms and crises at roughly 10-year intervals
  - **England Railway Mania**
- Joseph Schumpeter, Speculators are in the vanguard of capitalist process. Once an innovation has been established and produces steady returns, speculation gives way to investment, which is more concerned with safety of principal and regularity of income than with capital gains. &amp;quot;Unlike the speculator, the investor is primarily interested in the current state of affairs; insofar as he anticipates the future at all, he hopes that it will be a seamless continuation of the present.&amp;quot;
- Innovations and novelties have always excited speculators.
- The railway journals were enthusiastic and uncritical supporters of railway schemes. They &amp;quot;puffed&amp;quot; new offerings and in return got hundreds of thousands of pounds spent on weekly advertisements
- There was an abundant of oversupply in terms of proposals for the very same rail-lines; each of these stock companies would all trade a premium even though it was known that only one of them would succeed and actually be allowed to build
- Economist article &amp;quot;There is not a single dabbler in scrip who does not steadfastly believe-first, that a crash sooner or later, in inevitable; and, secondly, that he himself will escape it. When the luck turns, and the crack play devil take the hindmost, no one fancies that the last mail train from PANIC station will leave him behind. In this &amp;#39;Men deem all men mortal but themselves.&amp;#39;&amp;quot;
- There was an &amp;quot;extraordinary diversion of capital from traditional purposes to the construction of railways.&amp;quot; It took nearly 2 years for the full impact of the reckless railway speculation to be felt in the economy at large.
  - **The Gilded Age**
- The aim of the corner was to acquire a sufficient number of shares to force up the price and catch out the bears who had sold short
  - He who sells what isn&amp;#39;t his&amp;#39;n, must buy it back or go to pris&amp;#39;n
- Corners were normally undertaken by informal speculative partnerships and accompanied by market manipulation. It is a tense game that often fails.
- &amp;quot;Call&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Margin&amp;quot; loans became common and increased volatility in the market
- During a market crisis, call rates rose sharply and loans were withdrawn, but because liquidity in the stock market dried up and borrowers were unable to sell securities, banks often experienced difficulty in retrieving their loans. This makes banks vulnerable to panics
- Congress passed a law outlawing trading in gold futures, but this only caused panic and gold shot up by 33%
- Some speculators, known as &amp;quot;panic birds&amp;quot; came to the market only once prices had crashed and money was scarce; the bought carefully, locked up their investments, and kept away from Wall Street until the next calamity stuck.
- But most speculators got caught up in the carnival atmosphere and remained until they lost everything
- Although the market is better regulated today, the speculators propensity for manipulation has not diminished with time
  - **The Crash of 1929**
- &amp;quot;Stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau.&amp;quot; Yale economist Irving Fisher a few weeks before the crash
  - He believed that America had entered a &amp;quot;new era&amp;quot; of limitless prosperity
- People tend to &amp;quot;fancy the prosperity they see will always last, that it is only the beginning of a greater prosperity.&amp;quot;
- People believe we are living in a &amp;quot;new era&amp;quot; and that old rules and principles and precedents of finance were obsolete. That things could safely be done today which had been dangerous and impossible in the past
- Some time passes and people forget the past lessons and the same arguments come back and the same lessons must be relearned
- The rich became richer during the 1920&amp;#39;s, but the workers were unable to enjoy the benefits of their improved productivity.
  - Unable to maintain their share of the economic surplus, workers experienced a decline in real wages during the decade as corporate profits rose
  - Capitalism, however, requires consumers as much as savers. But the demand was maintained by a massive expansion of consumer credit
  - Consumers, in their appetite for immediate gratification, were devouring their future. And when that future finally arrived, the cupboard was bare.
- Margin loans were being used to invest in the stock market, further pushing up asset prices. This created a vicious circle
- The federal reserve ignited a bubble by lowering interest rates to help the bank of England stop the flow of Gold
  - Once the fed realized they created a bubble, they increased rates from an all-time low of 3.5% back to 6%. But this interest was too low to reduce speculation while also being too high for the economy as a whole
- Lots of new brokerage houses opened at the peak. Usually, to sell to retail investors who were not as financially literate
- Charles Mitchell became the most prominent cheerleader of the bull market and &amp;quot;new era&amp;quot; investing. He stated stocks were as safe as bonds. He went bankrupt after the crash
- The most striking thing about the stock market boom of the 1920&amp;#39;s was how speculation became central to the culture
- A dominate feature of the 1920&amp;#39;s stock market was the use of debt to pyramid investments and enhance gains.
- Groucho Marx &amp;quot;No need to employ a financial advisor to select your stocks. You can close your eyes, stick your finger any place on the big board and the stock you bought would start rising.&amp;quot;
- Leverage was not confined to individuals&amp;#39; speculators margin holdings; it became built into the financial structure of corporate America
- History, which has a painful way of repeating itself, has taught mankind that speculative overexpansion invariably ends in over contraction and distress…. If orgies of speculation are permitted to spread too far, however, the ultimate collapse is certain not only to affect the speculators themselves, but also to bring about a general depression involving the entire country.
- Shares were trading at 30 P/E&amp;#39;s
- Crowds and bull markets are inherently unstable; it has no stasis, no point of equilibrium, and is driven by the dynamic either to grow or shrink. At the moment of its dispersal, a crowd frequently succumbs to panic, often at the most minor things.
- The intellectual inferiority of the crowd is a sign that people are filtering and manipulating information to make it agree with their existing beliefs. This is known as &amp;quot;Cognitive Dissonance&amp;quot; and dissonant information, which contradicts the collective fantasy, is uncomfortable and people seek to avoid it.
  - A group will maintain a state of cognitive dissonance until the pain exceeds the rewards. Or in stock market terms, the fear of loss outweighs the greed for gains
- Roger Babson forecast an imminent stock market crash and was met with a savage response from the new era speculators
- The panic before the 1929 stock market crash had no palpable cause. It was not proceeded by tightness in the money market. No banking brokerage, or industrial failure served to trigger
- The glamour stocks (High P/E) of the bull market suffered the worst damage
- 1920&amp;#39;s similar to 1990&amp;#39;s
- The rise in speculation was initially stimulated by low interest rates
- The belief that the stock market would invariably produce the greatest returns led investors to purchase shares regardless of price even though P/E&amp;#39;s were at historic highs
- Investors saw each market decline as an opportunity to &amp;quot;buy into the dip&amp;quot; and as a result, every downturn was quickly reversed
- The rising stock market inflated investors expectations to irrational levels
- In the short run, the rising stock market serves to cover up weakness in the economy. Consumers spend their stock market gains and ignore rising debts, companies issue new shares or bonds, and governments enjoy rising tax receipts
  - **Cowboy Capitalism**
- When governments find their formal currency arrangements disintegrating, the speculator becomes a convenient scapegoat
- Nixon suspended the convertibility of the dollar to gold on August 15, 1971
- Whenever speculation got out of hand and a financial crisis appeared, everyone seeks refuge in the precious metal Gold. Gold represents the antithesis of speculative values
- Warren Buffett &amp;quot;Observing correctly that the market was _frequently_ efficient, they (the EMH people) went on to conclude incorrectly that it was _always_ efficient.&amp;quot; As a result, people were encouraged to bid up prices to unsustainable levels
- The &amp;quot;nifty-fifty&amp;quot; boom of 1972, during which it was stated that no price is too high to pay for America&amp;#39;s leading companies, was followed by a steep market decline
- The best hedge against the chronic inflation of the period could be found in commodities and precious metals
- Mike Milken of Drexel Burnham Lambert pushed junk bonds as the new asset class investors had to be involved in; he claimed that the companies behind these bonds were not nearly as speculative and risky as credit rating agencies claimed they were
  - Once the figures could be examined, it became clear that junk bonds considerably underperformed investment grade bonds
- Popular lessons from the Great Depression began to be discarded and views towards business and debt shifted to being positive once more
  - **Japan Capitalism**
- Japanese share prices increased 3x faster than corporate earnings. 100x-400x P/E were not uncommon on Japanese stocks. There were all sorts of reasons for justifying this valuation (Japanese accounting understated real earnings, japan was becoming the world economic growth engine, a boom in consumer demand was around the corner, interest rates were low and there were no other alternatives, etc.).
- This speculation created a feedback loop: speculation manufactured profits, causing share prices to rise, which further increased speculation profits and ability of companies to raise money abroad to speculate more
- At the end of the bubble, the P/E of the Japanese market topped 80. Dividend yields were under 0.5% and stocks were selling for 6x book value. Margin was extensively used to buy stocks.
- Governor Mieno mission was to prick the bubble, he subsequently raised interest rates which pricked the bubble. The Japanese stock market did not collapse with a sudden jolt. Instead, it gently went down
- Even thought the Ministry of Finance had manipulated the market on the way up (through various means), the attempts to control its decent was less successful. In total it went down by more than 60%
  - Japanese authorities refused to allow prices of stock and property to sink low enough to find their clearing level (the price at which buyers = sellers)
    - Instead of alleviating the problems, the authority&amp;#39;s mismanagement succeeded only in drawing out the painful aftermath of the bubble
- Consumer spending, the other great prop of the bubble economy, declined as the &amp;quot;wealth effect&amp;quot; reversed direction
- The government announced a series of fiscal boosts to stimulate the economy and revive the stock market. Foreign banks even offered negative yields on Yen deposits (Japanese depositors paid the privilege of lending their money to overseas banks, which they considered safer than Japanese banks)
- By 1998, the post-bubble revulsion against stocks was so severe that over 60% of Japanese personal assets were committed to cash earning less than 0.5%
- Economies in the process of liberalization appear to be especially susceptible to outbreaks of speculation
- The bubble economy illustrates the danger that arises when investors believe that market risk is shouldered by the government rather than themselves (moral hazard). Throughout the 1980&amp;#39;s, the sceptics were told that the Japanese government would not allow share prices to fall and the Japanese banks and brokerages were &amp;quot;too big to fail&amp;quot;
  - **Hedge Funds or Rogue Economists**
- Even George Soros did not invest in derivative products because he could not understand them
- The flaw in LTCM (Long-Term Capital Management) trading strategies was to assume that the historical relationship between various asset could be depended upon for future speculation.

# **William Bernstein The Delusions of Crowds: Why People Go Mad in Groups**

4 Signs of a bubble

1. Everyone around you is talking about it. And you should start worrying when people talking about getting rich in certain areas of the market don&amp;#39;t have a background in finance
2. When people begin to quit their jobs to speculate in the markets
3. When someone exhibits skepticism about the prospects and people don&amp;#39;t just disagree with them, but they do so vehemently. They usually say &amp;quot;You just don&amp;#39;t get it.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;New Era&amp;quot; &amp;quot;It is different this time&amp;quot;
4. When you start to see extreme predictions.

- Human beings intuitively seek out outcomes with very high but very rare payoffs, such as lottery tickets, that on average lose money but tantalize their buyers with the chimera of unimaginable wealth
- Researchers have found that our brains fire not only with reward, but even more intensely with its anticipation.
  - There is nothing so disturbing to one&amp;#39;s well-being and judgement as to see a friend get rich
- When presented with facts and data that contradict our deeply held beliefs, we generally do not reconsider and alter those beliefs appropriately. More often, we avoid contrary facts and data, and when we cannot avoid them, our erroneous assessments will even harden and make us more likely to proselytize them.
- People respond more to narratives than to facts and data. And the more compelling the story, the more it erodes our critical thinking skills
- We have 2 different types of thought process
  - System 1 or &amp;quot;reptilian brain&amp;quot; that is fast moving emotional response
  - System 2 or &amp;quot;evolutionary brain&amp;quot; that is much slower conscious reasoning
    - Our faster emotional machinery leads, and our slower &amp;quot;reason&amp;quot; follows
    - In a state of nature, the advantages of system 1 are obvious (IE - hissing snake at your feet). But in a relatively safe post-industrial world where dangers have a longer time horizon, system 1 dominance often occurs at great costs
- Bank supplied leverage is the fuel that powers modern financial manias and it has brought with it a roller coaster of bubbles and busts
  - Over the last 4 centuries, financial innovation has yielded a dizzying variety of investment vehicles: each, in its turn, was often simply leverage in a slightly different disguise and would prove the tinder that would set alight successive waves of speculative excess
- Bubbles typically end with a seemingly small disturbance, followed by a swift collapse
- Throughout history, property prices have ranged between five and twenty times annual rental values.
- When investors are unhappy with ultra-low interest rates offered on safe assets, they bid up the prices of risk assets with rosier potential income.
  - The allure of the hypnotic new technology (early 1800&amp;#39;s railroads) was amplified, as is almost always the case with bubbles, by falling interest rates, which makes investment capital more plentiful
- Every bubble carry within it the seeds of its own destruction
- When compelling narrative and objective fact collide, the former often survives.
- Human beings suffer from confirmation bias, in which once they have settled on a hypothesis or belief system, pay attention only to data that supports their beliefs and avoid data that contradicts it.
- Hyman Minsky thought bubbles needed 2 conditions
  - Easy credit via low interest rates
  - Advent of new technology
- Investors excited about new technologies, or financial products, etc. begin to pour money into them. Since these assets can also be used as collateral for loans, rising prices mean that speculators can borrow even more to pour into these assets. A self-reinforcing cycle develops. But only on the way up
- Minsky developed the &amp;quot;instability hypothesis&amp;quot; which states that in a safe and stable financial environment, money inevitably migrates away from safe borrowers and toward risky ones. Eventually, things get out of hand, resulting in a blowup, which makes lenders and investors more prudent, and the cycle begins anew. Usually about once per decade
  - Amnesia is implicit in the instability hypothesis. After a crisis, investors shy away from risk. As markets recover and the unpleasant memories fade, participants become more open to risk and the instability cycle begins anew.
  - We all like a good story; in the grip of a bubble, when faced with the unpleasant or difficult calculation, a compelling narrative provides easy escape from the effort of rigorous analysis.
- Abandonment of hardheaded financial calculations in favor of compelling narratives is another factor that precipitates financial manias
  - Rather than attempt the nearly impossible estimation of the value of a stock with high projected future earnings (South Sea in 1720, RCA in 1928, Pets.com in 1999, or Tesla today) investors default back to the simple heuristic: &amp;quot;X is a great company and it is going to change the world, and its worth paying almost any price for it.&amp;quot;
- Humans have a recency bias: If stock prices have been rising for the past several years, they will come to believe that equity levels will continue to do so forever; as prices climb, shares become more attractive, which drives up prices even more. The reverse also happens during bear markets
- John Templeton &amp;quot;The four most expensive words in the English language are &amp;#39;This time it&amp;#39;s different.&amp;#39;&amp;quot;
- Max Winkler observed after the 1920 crash and discovery of the Dividend Discount Model that the market discounted not only the future, but the hereafter as well
- Debt can grow faster than the rest of the economy for so long before they implode
  - This is particularly true of private debt
- During bubbles, people become intoxicated by the pursuit of effortless wealth
- Even if we can&amp;#39;t model bubbles, we know what they look like
- Minsky&amp;#39;s amnesia requirement usually reveals a generational divide during bubbles; only participants old enough to recall the last boom and bust are likely to be skeptical. Their younger and more enthusiastic colleagues will deride them as old fogies
  - Bubbles are the province of young people with short memories
- Market Bubbles require 4 necessary conditions
  - Technological and financial displacement
  - Credit loosening
  - Amnesia of the past
  - Abandonment of time-honored valuation principles
- Under most circumstances, the Federal Reserve cares about 2 things
  - Overall state of the economy (as measured by GDP growth and unemployment)
  - Keeping inflation under control
    - Stock prices are of lesser concern and often wind up a bystander of the other 2 policies
- The Fed primary operates via the federal funds rate (interest rate at which member banks lend to each other overnight)
  - When interest rates on these are high, they attract investors. Which pulls investment from risk assets (stocks) and lowers their prices. The opposite is true
- We are apes who tell stories. When our remote ancestors needed to communicate with each other to survive, they did not do so with syllogisms, numerical data, or mathematics. The primary mode of that communication was and still is narration.
- Humans are narrative animals, no matter how misleading the narrative, if it is compelling enough it will nearly always trump the facts, at least until those facts cause great pain.
  - The more compelling the narrative, the more it erodes are analytical thinking
  - We also mold the facts to fit our preexisting opinion
    - We cling to facts that fit our narrative and ignore those that disconfirm them
    - We intentionally avoid exposing ourselves to contrary data
  - A compelling narrative can spread through a population just like a virus would and can even acquire critical mass
    - As more and more people share the same delusion, the more likely we are to believe in it, and so the more likely those around us will do so as well, a vicious cycle ensues, gaining more and more momentum until they finally smash into the brick wall of reality.

# **Fred Schwed Where are the Customers Yachts?**

- Once in the dear dead days beyond recall, an out-of-town visitor was being shown the wonders of the New York financial district. When the party arrived at the battery, one of his guides indicated some handsome ships riding at anchor. He said, &amp;quot;Look, those are the bankers and brokers yachts.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Where are the customers yachts?&amp;quot; asked the naïve visitor.
- One can&amp;#39;t say figures lie. But figures, as used in financial arguments, seem to have the bad habit of expressing a small part of the truth forcibly, and neglecting the other part, as do some people we know
- Customers have the unfortunate habit of asking about the financial future. Now if you do someone the signal honor of asking him a difficult question, you may be assured that you will get a detailed answer. Rarely will it be the most difficult of all answers---&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know.&amp;quot;
- Those classes of investment considered &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; change from period to period. The pathetic fallacy is that what are thought to be the best are in truth only the most popular – the most active, the most talked of, the most boosted, and consequently, the highest in price at the time.
- You can&amp;#39;t ask an experienced Wall Street man to buy stocks when they have just hit a new low and unemployment is at a peak. Unfortunately for everyone concerned, these are the only time when stocks are down. When &amp;quot;conditions are good, the forward-looking investor buys. But when &amp;quot;conditions&amp;quot; are good, stocks are high. Then without anyone having the courtesy to ring a warning bell, &amp;quot;conditions&amp;quot; get bad.
- Some people believe in charts implicitly, and many more take a peculiar half and half position. Major Angas in describing several chart systems, concludes &amp;quot;All of these theories are true part of the time, none of them all the time. They are, therefore, dangerous, though sometimes useful.&amp;quot; The same could be said of the practice of flipping a coin to determine weather one should buy or sell.
- When a student peers, however closely, at a graph of the Dow-Jones averages, for instance, all he sees for certain is a history of past performance clearly and conveniently depicted. That one can, by examining a line already drawn, make a useful guess at the line not yet drawn, must be predicated on the hypothesis that &amp;quot;history repeats itself.&amp;quot; History does in a vague way repeat itself, but it does it slowly and ponderously, and with an infinite number of surprising variations.
- There have always been a considerable number of pathetic people who busy themselves examining the last 1000 numbers which have appeared on the roulette wheel in search of some repeating pattern. Sadly enough, they have usually found it.
- The full flavor of losing money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey to an inexperienced girl what it is truly like to be a wife and mother. There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin either by words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it feels like to lose a real chunk of money that you used to own.
- Speculation is an effort, probably unsuccessful, to turn a little money into a lot.
- Investment is an effort, which should be successful, to prevent a lot of money from becoming a little.

There might also be a strong ""return to work"" boost in sales because enterprise's have been using services like Teams and Zoom while WFH, but as employees return to the office they will need to adopt a digital device rather than the traditional desktop anal log phone.

The ticket used to be called PLT and I bought it cause I thought it was Palantir. I actually made quite a bit of money (\~$200 / 25% return) So I decided to up the ante and try and play earnings and got completely slaughtered.

I've already lost the money, so this post isn't about trying to salvage those 8/20 calls I'm down 98% on. I just want to try and put my reasons for investing in this company out here for you wise men and retards at WSB to try and ask you, where did I go wrong?

&amp;#x200B;



Neil Armstrong said the first words on the Moon with a Plantronics headset. So when we Moon, I recommend POLY. I use them at work, they are great quality, (but expensive). POLY's main source of revenue is enterprise communications device sales.

I'm thinking that POLY will see a Return To Work boost. I don't think companies will go back to using analog devices. Many companies have been using Teams, Zoom, etc. to accommodate people working from home. Back in the early days, people just went on Amazon and bought whatever cheap USB / Bluetooth mic they could. POLY does not focus on the consumer device level, so unfortunately they did not profit from WFH. But when people start to come back to the office they will find themselves needing a new headset so they can communicate on Teams or Zoom. I guess they could dial in with their traditional office phone, but I don't think people will want to go back to doing that. As enterprises place orders for new Bluetooth and digital devices I envision they will stick with Plantronics.

After the Q1 22' earnings and subsequent guidance for Q2, the stock is currently down about 14%. Even though the guidance was not really bad news with both revenue and EPS forecast to increase.

I think there is room for a lot of room for upside with this company. They are making inroads into enterprise video devices (94% increase yoy). The chip shortage is improving, so Plantronics' gross margins will improve significantly. Finally, they have a new CEO who seems like a cool guy.

End of July I posted a DD about what I was going to be looking for in $RKT's Q2 earnings report in order to stay bullish. Below I will highlight some key points from Q2 that not only affirm my bullishness on $RKT but show proof $RKT is beginning to break away from the industry competition towards a fintech valuation. 

Jay finally realized he needs to be a better promoter of his company and not let the results solely speak for themselves and he delivered on the earnings call. 

Rocket Homes and Rocket Auto saw explosive growth! 

**Rocket Homes** increase ""*six-fold in Q2 '21 as compared to Q2 '20*"" and had 2 million average unique monthly visitors. For comparison Zillow has approximately 36 million unique monthly visitors showing the room for this revenue stream to continue to grow. Additionally, ""*approximately 70% of Rocket Homes closings involve both an agent in the Rocket Homes real estate agent network and Rocket Mortgage*"" allowing Rocket horizontal and vertical integration of the loan buying expirence as they lock in clients for all of their mortgage/financing seeking services. The Rocket Homes app is now available in all 50 states and it is clear this sector will continue to explode with growth. The new announcement into solar will further promote the growth of Rocket Homes putting them ahead of Zillow in terms of innovation in my opinion.

**Rocket Autos** This sector of the business saw a jump in auto units sold *""143%, as compared to Q2'20""* and they have not even launched the app yet for this sector! Rocket Auto gets it's auto sales by third party referrals per the quote from the earnings report ""*In Q2'21, one of the largest online sellers of used cars joined Rocket Auto's partnership network, giving Rocket Auto access to tens of thousands of additional used cars to sell through its constantly expanding platform*"". 

It is worth noting that Jay mentioned in his earnings call that inventory constraints in housing and autos played a role in limiting the amount of transactions in Rocket Homes and Rocket Autos and that volume in Q2 would have been even higher if not for supply chain issues.  ""*we believe both record purchase volume and record auto results would have been even higher if not for inventory challenges*""

**Gain on Sale** This is a very popular area all of the analysts like to focus their attention. The FUD was that RKT was in a price war with UWMC and that they will both have lower earnings due to the price war. RKT being the market leader was viewed as having the most to lose since they would have to cut pricing the most. To my surprise RKT gain on sale came in at  2.7% for the quarter, down from 3.74% in the first quarter as compared to UWMC which was 0.81% from 2.19% in the previous quarter. In addition to higher gain on sale margin than competitors RKT is forecasting a range of 2.7%-3.0% for Q3 and is forecasting a record closed volume year for 2021 despite the unusual large pull forward of loans processed in 2020. This reaffirms Rocket is able to become the largest mortgage lender by 2023 while maintaining gain margin % higher than the competition.

**Share buy back** This is something that really drove it all home to me was that the CFO and RKT team is committed to their investors and began their share buyback program in Q2 when the stock fell into the $16 range (screenshot below from their 10Q)

&amp;#x200B;



  The CFO also made the following remarks on the call reaffirming RKT commitment to shareholders and proving they will not let this stock continue to get manipulated and undervalued. 

 *""we need less than $1 billion of cash on hand to properly operate our business. With $7.8 billion in available liquidity, the $4.4 billion in total cash is largely held for investments, dividends, and share buybacks""*  

*""At current price levels, we believe our stock is undervalued. Over the past 24 months, we have generated $16.3 billion in adjusted EBITDA.*

*Our MSR portfolio has a fair value of $4.6 billion, and our balance sheet has total equity of $8.2 billion. With our current levels of capital, we have the opportunity to repurchase shares and return capital to shareholders via dividends as we've done in the past, while still being able to invest in the business and consider acquisition opportunities. We will deploy our capital in a strategic and disciplined manner to generate long-term shareholder value. With that, we are ready to turn it back to the operator for questions.""*

**Hedge against FUD and higher interest rates** Rocket is proving that they are a company that is not solely based on refinance volume with their integrated client service network to serve their clients across their innovative mortgage technology platform with a 60% returning client across their ecosystem of services. I personally think Rocket proved this quarter that they will continue to deliver great earnings and protect shareholders despite higher rates. As a hedge against wall street thinking a higher 10 year yield curve will sink this company stock I recommend buying puts on the IEF ETF which tracks the 10 year treasury. Particularly I recommend the 2023 puts which I also own listed below.

BLND is one of the fastest-growing fintech SaaS companies, which can trade at 30-40-50x+ NTM revenue. They will report their first ER on 8/19. 

Now $18.40, PT $30+ 

Background:
BLND is a fintech saas for banks, focused on consumer credit. They help financial institutions better compete with companies like RKT, and focus on providing a frictionless experience for consumers. 

CEO and co-founder, Nima Ghamsari, started the company in 2012 with the vision of bringing “simplicity and transparency to financial services” by making the process of applying for a mortgage or opening an account as easy as buying something online.

Products:
Today, BLND offers a suite of products for their financial services customers to modernize the consumer banking journeys for mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, vehicle loans, personal loans, credit cards, and deposit accounts. This list showcases their successful track record of applying their technology to multiple use cases and speed of GTM. The company started with mortgages and was able to GTM for home equity loans in 2018, for vehicle loans and deposit accounts in 2019, credit cards and personal loans in 2020, and already has set its heights on other areas that it can use their technology.

Additionally, BLND now has over 45 direct technology integrations, and that includes with customer relationship management platforms, loan origination platforms, banking products, pricing engines, product engines, as well as there's actually more than 1,200 realtors, 24 insurance agents, 900 settlement agents, and 29 data providers that are all providing information back to Blend Labs. They believe that those numbers are going to continue to grow, and if so, that can create a virtuous cycle that really builds this company's competitive advantage (flywheel effect).

Customers and Performance:
They are used by 31 of the top 100 U.S. financial firms, 24 of the top 100 non-mortgage bank lenders, and overall, they have 291 customers, including the likes of Opendoor. 
1. Process more than $5B in loan volume per day on average
2. Ended 2020 with 291 total customers, used by 31 of the top 100 U.S. financial firms and 24 of the top 100 non-mortgage bank lenders
3. Saw banking transaction volume growth of 190% YoY% with 2020 dollar-based net revenue retention rate of 162%. (This DBNRR is Twilio, Snowflake, Zoom levels)
4. Saw revenue growth of 90% YoY, $50.7M -&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; 96M
5. Non-GAAP gross margin was 66% last quarter and non-GAAP operating margin was (73)% last quarter, up from (127)% in Q1’20.
6. 18 customers paid more than $1M a year, comprising 53% of 2020 revenue ($50.1M). By dividing the $50.1M of 2020 revenue attributable to those customers by 18, it shows those customers pay $2.8M annually on average.
7. Revenue from their largest customer, which they disclose as “Customer A”, was $12.5M or 13% of total revenue in 2020. By subtracting that $12.5M of revenue from the $50.1M of revenue mentioned above and dividing that figure by 17, it shows that customers paying over $1M, excluding the single largest customer, pay ~$2.3M annually on average.
8. As of March 31, 2021, Blend’s product portfolio consisted of 7 primary software products, and 61% of customers were using two or more products or marketplaces.

Acquisition: 
Blend made a large acquisition of a company called Title365, a title insurance agency, in March-2021 for $422.1M. Title365 did $212.1M of revenue in 2020. Title365 will be integrated with our software platform, which enables financial services firms to automate title commitments and streamline communication with consumers and settlement teams. The transaction is expected to close in the second or third quarter of this year. 

Competitors:
Include Black Knight, Ice Mortgage Technology, nCino, Qualia

Additional info:
BLND IPO'd on 7/15 at $18 per share, raising $335 million after subtracting fees. They will report their first ER on 8/19. 
Their lockup expires 1/12/22 (so no unexpected dumping in the next couple months at minimum).

Not financial advice.

EDIT:

My ER projection, price closes above $20 on Thursday and shoots up to $25+ AH.

EDIT 2:

Mute response to ER numbers so far, dropped from $19.79 to $17.95. Maybe we’ll have to wait for another ER. Let’s see how the call goes. 

Added 1,000 more shares at $18.15 to make my new total position 2,000 shares at $18.12 average cost.

EDIT 3:

Wrong on market reaction to ER. Very disappointed in the executive team as it seemed that they either did not prep enough or the call was not a priority for them. Also the decisions to not disclose and breakdown certain data around revenue, pipeline, gross profit is concerning…in addition to not offering any closing remarks 🤨.

I still remain bullish on the market, products, and customers, but have tempered expectations on timing. Thought this would receive much more love from the markets but the CC did not particularly instill confidence. 

Holding long, waiting for the next ER. Will cut under $16 if it gets there.

EDIT 4:

Glad to see this recover next day. $18 seems to be a magnet. If this was truly bad then it’d be dumping even more but it’s getting bought up as of 7 am PT. Holding long!

EDIT 5:

Was wrong on this. Cut at $16 for loss. Will be looking for the next play. Flat QoQ on mortgages indicating softening in the market to me.","Meet the next Upstart -&gt; Blend Labs, Inc. (BLND)",64,7

Have anyone of you bought any carbon credits via an exchange? specifically CCU on futures contracts or long calls on them?

Would you guys have any ideas where to go for these contracts?

I know there are 2 ETF's which have some exposure for them namely –  ICLN (0.42% MER) &amp; First Trust Carbon Impact – managed (1.02% ++).

Better get it at the dip since they just had a fire few months ago which affected the stock, It is also newly traded company.

## Key Points

* Coupang posted its 15th straight quarter of more than 50% year-over-year sales growth.

## Coupang's core business is still growing

Coupang's revenue rose 71% year over year (57% on a constant currency basis) to $4.48 billion, beating estimates by $50 million and marking its 15th consecutive quarter of more than 50% year-over-year constant currency sales growth.

analysts expect its revenue to rise 62% for the full year and for its bottom line to remain in the red. Coupang trades at just three times this year's sales, which is comparable to **Amazon**'s ([NASDAQ:AMZN]( [price-to-sales]( ratio.

Firstly, HIMS is a telehealth company. Yes, I know, there's a million of them and most of them are pissing money away like a firehose, hiring doctor's with fisher-price degrees, and treating their patients to a user experience not dissimilar to a chainsaw circumcision. Thankfully, HIMS is different.

HIMS targets only a handful of very widespread conditions that can be easily diagnosed and prescribed for without a physical examination. Balding, erectile dysfunction, and depression don't require a physician fondling you, a quick questionnaire is more than enough. This focus has allowed HIMS to streamline it's operation and utterly Bill Cosby the competition despite the telehealth industry being ""competitive and oversaturated"" with earnings beats nearly every quarter and an almost unbelievable gross margin of 78% .

Users love hims. Sales are up, the amount purchased per sale is up, return customers are up

HIMS has recently moved into the telehealth therapy and anti-depressant prescription market. This is HUGE. This represents their first business segment that offers prescriptions that are covered by insurance.

Why does this matter? With insurance, the cheap prices HIMS users pay will be even cheaper. Demand will rocket even higher, and pull potential users away from their brick-and-mortar providers.

&amp;#x200B;

""BUT... BUT... WHAT IF INSURANCE COMPANIES DON'T WANT TO COVER HIMS?""

This is the best part. In many states, they won't have the choice. HIMS has their little greedy balls in a vice grip thanks to covid-related legislation that FORCES insurance companies to cover telehealth visits and prescriptions. If HIMS asks, these companies won't have any choice to comply. Home. Fucking. Run.

First and foremost, trend:

We are currently in the midst of a automation revolution, one that’s only beginning to pick up steam. With the passing of the infrastructure bill eminent, there’s going to be a lot of money pushed into shoring up the US supply chain and manufacturing. If you think these big companies are going to spend all that money just to build the exact same human run factories you’ve got another thing coming. Just look at Sony’s latest factory for PlayStation - which pumps out one unit every 30 seconds and is manned by only 4 people (

Furthermore, with threats of unionization in warehouses and points of distribution (a specialty for BGRY) there’s a big push toward efficiency creation via automation. More jobs for robots, less for people. This combined with an unending and only growing surge in online ordering speaks volumes for the potential of the sector. 

Next, some fundamentals:

BGRY is run by the former CTO of iRobot - Tom Wagner. Under his engineering mind, the company has built a patent portfolio over 300 deep. This has helped the company not only establish itself quickly with a list of blue chip clients such as Walmart, FedEx, Target and TJX. Many of whom are expanding the partnership, like FedEx last week. 

The company expects to have $1.3bn in the order pipeline by 2025 and should exceed that. They also have a ton of cash on hand now ($500m) for expansion.

[ \\""Boats 'n Hoes, Boats 'n Hoes, I gotta have me more boats 'n hoes\\""](

 

Sup retards, today I have a play for you that is not only \*Risk Free\* but a guaranteed 20-50 bagger, with the potential to be a 100 bagger. JPOW continues his reign of printing and the FED is ded. SPY will reach 600 this year and this guy’s (I can't find said user lol) calls will go ITM. Everyone wants a correction, so naturally, it will never happen (at least in the near future). 

You may have heard of theta gang before, but the lesser-known Vega Gang is not only more cost-effective, less time-consuming, but works perfectly in the current low volatility, ultra degenerate economy we have today.

If you don’t already know, the vega value on your options shows how much your call or put increases in value for every 1% increase in IV. High Vega in an option means when volatility jumps (like during a crash) in the overall market (see VIX) and IV jumps massively across the board, your option will increase MASSIVELY in price regardless of the direction it moves in. 

Now, what options generally have the highest vega? Far dated ones, specifically LEAPS. Now, if we are using this to hedge a crash, we expect a sudden and large movement, so going FAR OTM is the big brain play. Basically, we want **cheap, Far OTM LEAPS**, to hedge our portfolios. 

Upon running all the calculations, I have concluded that I have ***no money at risk***. These puts are already **worthless (20 cents)** and it is **unlikely they can become even more worthless**.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Just like our autistic savant Michael Burry once said, “Thou puts are risk free, eventually.” ](

\---

For those of you who don’t know how to read and only trade SPY calls:

**WHY SPY JUNE 17 2022 100 PUTS is the ULTIMATE 100 bagger trade:**

* You have an **entire year** for this trade to work out (although move to 2023 ones by January).
* Delta is almost 0 so price movement barely effects the currently worthless puts
* **Vega is juicy** and the puts are **dirt cheap**. 
* **Options calculator is showing some massive theoretical returns that may even be an underestimate.**
* **Over the next year you just need one spike in IV for MASSIVE TENDIES. I know you’re terrible at timing the market, but this gives you a chance to be a ️‍🌈🐻 without actually needing the market to tank immediately. You just need IV to increase and that can happen if SPY goes up faster as well, to 690.**

Based on options calculator, **and a 50% IV increase** (during the corona crash it hit nearly 150% to 200% on some SPY options), this is the profit chart over the next **5 months**: 

[You can go to optionsprofitcalculator to see the rest of the dates.](

**With a 100% IV increase**, this is the profit chart if there is a correciton in the next **5 months**: 

[You can go to optionsprofitcalculator to see the rest of the dates.](

Currently these are worth around 20 cents and a 20% correction (SPY $360) with 50% IV increase would mean these would each be worth $5.05 even if said correction happened by end of year, or about a **25 bagger**. With a 100% IV increase, these would be worth about $20.00, or a **100 bagger**. Even if the correction took a year, or SPY goes to 600 by the beginning of next year, this would be a multi bagger play. The only way you lose is if SPY stays flat for half a year, which we all know is not happening.

Basically, unless SPY reaches 600 by next year and IV never increases or it stays flat, these puts will at a minimum keep the same value. Which is why I consider this a **risk free hedge**. Having 2% of the port in these puts acts as free insurance against the rest of your money. 

**I am also doing the same thing with TSLA 50P JAN 2023. However, I only have a few of these and because it’s not as liquid, this is a pretty retarded play that nobody should be doing. However, I am sure almost all of you will be doing this exact same play. My reasoning behind this is that if there were a crash, TSLA would tank the most due to having an extremely inflated stock price with numbers that don’t justify its current market cap.** 

Also, **this does not mean I think SPY will go to $100 or TSLA will go to $50 lol**, FAR OTM just maximizes profit. If these puts went ITM, we all have far bigger issues to worry about. 

**# I’M AN IDIOT, WHAT’S THE PLAY?**

**SPY JUNE 17 2022 100P**

**TSLA JAN 2023 50P (please don’t do this🤡)**

 **I plan to hold these puts until they print. Not financial advice.**  I will be listening to [this]( on repeat until then. I would also like to credit u/Duke_Shambles for the original idea. I was in TSLA 50P before his callout**🤡.**",$SPY JUNE 2022 100P Play: The Ultimate 100 Bagger,492,7

Pfizer has struggled to match Moderna in price due to their amount of outstanding shares, lack of pipe projects, and a bit of activity on the shorting end.

Call options for this thing are CHEAP. Like let me buy 100+ realistically-profitable contracts for the price of a fancy steak dinner cheap.

So the float is already all tied up.

And the board are buying back more of its shares:



And now look to see who is still reporting some shorting...

[Ignore the volume reported, but those names look familiar](

And then you notice that there might be a nice pull up from the options to $230 by the end of the week (which only have 0.65 bid price at present):

I am jumping to the safe side of the fence and selling all stocks I have gains on down to the ones with moderate losses.

Look at what happened in March 2020.  The pandemic became a world threat, and the stock market tanked as soon as the world started reacting to it.

Now we have China reporting worse than expected economy growth and shutting down one of their 3 largest ports because of COVID.  Inflation on the rise, gas prices on the rise, all ports are backed up with companies experiencing months of delays, Afganistan being taken over by the Taliban,  US Gulf Coast COVID-19 cases on the rise daily and predicted to move north as temperatures cool, and being reported the Fed will announce the tapering of asset purchases starting in September (which is predicted to start a 'Taper Tantrum' of selling).

The world is trying to play it cool dealing with all of this, but it is only a matter of time where the world cant turn a blind anymore and will have to react.

The fatal crash of a NIO ES8 sport-utility vehicle took place last week in China. The SUV is equipped with several driver assistance functions, including features enabled by Intel (ticker: INTC) division Mobileye, that enable some forms of autonomous driving. NIO’s driver assistance functions are called NIO Pilot and employ cameras as the so-called eyes of the car.

NIO has other autonomous-driving technology, referred to as NAD, such as radar, lidar—a laser-based radar—and camera vision, as well as computing power provided partly by Nvidia (NVDA) to process all the data points coming at the car.

The NAD features don’t appear to be available on all NIO vehicles, including the ES8. All autonomous driving systems require the driver to pay attention to the road at all times.

NIO responded to a request for comment with a Weibo post in Chinese. The post indicates the company is cooperating with police regarding the investigation.

The global automotive industry is still wrestling with regulatory and branding issues surrounding autonomous technology. Self-driving features, such as adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assistance, make driving safer as long as systems are used as intended. But drivers might rely too much on the features when systems are dubbed pilot or autopilot. Government safety regulators, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, are still drafting plans to prepare for the introduction of more advanced self-driving features.

Coloring books....

Coloring is something everyone can do....A few of you probably did it on the walls this morning. This is a key factor in emphasizing my rock solid DD on the validity of Coloring Books as a safe bet for seeing returns in the futures market, because this is a time of less than great market stability with some accompanying viral and missiles loads: It's like this section of history has a big collective cold. Well what do you do when you have a cold? Yes, Dilbert....You fucking color.

Look I'm trying to protect your trusty portfolio that you probably keep in a zip-up binder. Coloring books are also recession-proof..... Coloring relieves stress, and all you paper hands Peter's might find the investment better as a commodity rather than a future. For those that wanna get rich and get their colored page put up on the fridgerator at the NYSE, keep reading:

According to research, coloring books are an all-encompassing market that shows promising rise in quarterly reports. Just kidding about doing research, I didn't do the research, but man coloring book futures just feels so good in my brain when I use blood and electricity to make it think that. It has to be right, feels too good... No need to research when it feels this good up there. Mmmm...

Y'all, I feel like I shouldn't have to explain why investing in coloring book futures is a golden ticket idea, but I wish to be thorough here: Even with all the global wildfires, trees are still everywhere. Paper is literally fucking everywhere. We can make some coloring books with that paper. Ngl, it might be stressful to explain to your wife, your wife's bf, your therapist, the broker you stopped paying 7 weeks ago......Not everyone is going to be able to color between the lines on your genius. It will be stressful explaining to them how you are making the biggest 500 IQ move ever by dumping a few of the kids' college funds into an investment in the magic of colorful creativity and futures made out of paper products.

But do not worry, autist...Because the real magic happens when the stress of everyone who unwittingly participated in your Coloring Book futures investment reaches the fever pitch:That's when you get to pitch them a coloring book. Problem solved.

Hey. Look at me.When it comes to coloring outside the lines, stonks only color above.... Better make sure your portfolio in the zip-up binder is nice and secure, because your about to put a coloring book in there, homie. Time to get rich.

Ocugen is a clinical stage gene therapy biotechnology company that has recently gotten a lot of attention because it is partners with Bharat Biotech, a pharmaceutical company based in India, which manufactures Covaxin, a differentiated vaccine. It is currently being used in over 100 countries, and the news that comes out with regards to Covaxin will directly affect the stock price of OCGN. Currently, I am waiting on the WHO approval for this vaccine because if this happens, OCGN’s stock price will probably soar past the recent high of $18.77. 

Unfortunately, there has been quite a few delays on US FDA approval for this vaccine. However, it has had some bullish news recently regarding large institutional buys from Vanguard and even some retirement funds. All signs point towards an inevitable WHO approval. Below is the daily chart of OCGN from VIG.IO. As you can see, there is a cup and handle forming, which is very bullish from a technical standpoint.

If so, $NVDA, $AMZN, $GOOG and the like would soar to infinity beyond every earnings report but often go down after record breaking earnings. Why? Because of buying the rumor and selling the news and forward projections.

These companies are established and have to work hard to establish how they are going to continue growing at that pace, but for newer companies earnings miss are not only expected but a shakeout of weak paper hands. Remember $TSLA anyone?

So let's talk about $RBLX, who just post earnings announcement.

Here is the TLDR;

Q2 was less growth than Q1 compared to last year 🤦- well duh!?!?

Last Q2 was Apr 2020 - June 2020 which encompassed a rapid growth period for Roblox during the lockdowns.

Here's the incredibly bullish thing though - **there was growth** 🚀🚀🚀.  The bears against this suggest that it was just a pandemic play and that it faced strong headwinds because of that. Yet, despite the economy vast re-opening and $DIS exploding it's park attendance with blowout earnings, $RBLX still experienced vast growth YoY in the headwind environment. I think this will only continue to curve upwards as pandemic surge data moves out of focus. For the short-term and my tendies, the earnings call tomorrow will make a big impact whether this will print or not. The Delta variant is growing lockdown concerns again too. Either way, more lockdowns or not, $RBLX is a strong play with lots of insider buying too. There has to be something that Nancy and Cathie know. $85+ let's go 🚀🚀🚀!

I've been following HOOD pretty closely since their IPO, and it looks like their short-seller's are about to hit a giant brick wall that is their wives' boyfriends.

If you've never heard of it, HOOD is the stock ticker for company named Robinhood. They're a small, undiscovered micro-cap stock in the fintech space, specializing in a mobile-first brokerage/trading platform experience.

Last February, a retarded group of traders got really angry with them because of a situation with another relatively unknown micro-cap, GameStop. Never heard of these up-and-comers? Google it, we don't have the time a deep-dive here. If there's one thing I know though, this big beautiful group of retards absolutely hates money. So when HOOD IPOd a couple of weeks back, I expected these retards (they call themselves apes) to be spitefully short, no matter the cost. And you know what? They're even shorter than I could have imagined - this greasy bag of shit looks like it could blow up right in these crayon-eater's faces.

This is in no shape or form financial advice, I literally have no clue what the fuck I'm doing. Got it? Cool. Let's roll that beautiful bean footage.

According to Ortex, shorts are currently only able to borrow around 17.5 million total shares. The shorts have been at 100% utilization for the last 6 days. Is that a lot? I don't know. I know they only IPOd with 55 million shares. I have no clue if that's how many shares are currently in the public float. If it is, that's a lot (31.8%), and on par with several other current meme stonks like AMC. That said, I don't really think float matters in this case.



Ortex TLDR: All 17.5 million shares available for short-selling look to be already shorted.

Cross-referencing this info with Fintel, it seems to align.



As far as I can tell, HOOD is becoming harder and harder to short making it incredibly hard to artificially deflate the price.

The other thing giant red baboon butt stat in the bunch is the Cost To Borrow Rate. Ortex has this anywhere between 46.97 and 86.47%, with an average of 66.93%



66.93%...

Your mom said that's really expensive. She said, ""At a 67% borrow rate, @ a $49 share price, the stock would have to drop to $16.17 per share just for these shorts to break even"". I don't know her that math works out, but if does, you probably have better odds at breeding miniature horse ducks.

That's a lot of bleeding, I'd think that means these shorts need to make their money quick.

Not necessarily believing either of these garbage platforms, I decided to try and short a HOOD share myself, just to see what E-Trade told me. Here's what I got.





An estimated borrow rate of 48%. While that's not the 67% Ortex is touting, that's wayyyyy more than the standard 0.2 to 1% you'll find on other stocks like APPL, Z or SFIX.

Another point is the short-shares changing of hands seems to be slowing. I don't know how these crayon eaters have managed to swap out 4 - 8 million short-shares while keeping utilization at 100%, but good golly they've done been doing it. Ortex and Fintel give you different numbers, but either way you cut the baby it looks like the swapping is slowing down today.

&amp;#x200B;





Now what does all this mean? No fuckin idea. My best guess, I'd think volatility will increase going into earnings, and at that high of a borrow rate with that few of shares to short available, I wouldn't think the share price needs much movement to the upside to really start squeezing some balls.

I've noticed over the past year squeezes seem to happen on the Wednesday of the third week of the month. If you go back and look at GME and AMC, you'll see what I mean. I've been told this is because monthlies, weeklies and futures are expire on this date? So that's when most margins are called? Well guess what this week is. It's the third week of the month and that Wednesday is two days away. Making things even more interesting, HOOD, a fresh and highly-volatile IPO is set to report their first ever earnings after-hours on that fine day this third week of the month.

TLDR: Am retarded. Help. Not in any way financial advice.

I'm sure every one has been robbed by Theta Gang once or twice whilst YOLOing on FDs. There is nothing worst than death by a thousand cuts chopfest bringing your option to zero even though the stock hasn't moved. This post is going to show you how to identify that BEFORE you enter a trade - and how to get AROUND it altogether.

Markets only do two things: **they consolidate - or chop within a defined range gathering energy for the next move, and they trend - or break a defined range, moving in a straight line towards a new one.** This is the basis of most technical analysis and technical patterns.

Markets **consolidate about 70% of the time** and **trend about 30% of the time** \- but **most people only know how to trade the 30%!** This is why many fail - it's important to understand both scenarios.

# II. Rangebound Markets

This is when a market is chopping within a clearly defined range. Price will sell at the highs - and rise at the lows - constantly reverting to the ""mean"". The mean in this case is usually the center of the range. Price is chopping because it wants to see what buyers and sellers think of this range. Also, key players are building new positions here.

Basically - you are going to see a lot of chop with no clear direction - and long options holders of both varieties will get brutally fucked. IWM is a great example. It's been rangebound for 6 months.

# III. Trending Markets

This is when a market is moving in one direction - breaking into a new range. Price is ready to go; subsequently, buyers and sellers have finished adjusting their positions for the next move. The amount of time we spent rangebound determines the length of the trending move. The longer the better - and the wider the range, the better.

This is when you want to buy long options. Price will move perfectly for them to profit - and theta gang usually won't be an issue.

# IV. Practical Applications

* **Rangebound Markets**

In a market like this, the best strategies are mean reversion strategies. This means to buy the dip and sell the rip. You generally want to **stay away from short dated long options altogether** and play **with theta gang.** This means put credit spreads at the lows, call credit spreads at the highs. You could also use calendar spreads, or any other theta positive play. You want time and chop to be **working for you not against you.**

First though - you need to **identify the range.** You can do this through **technical patterns - or key levels.** Technical patterns are simply lines that define the range the price is consolidating - and when price is no longer consolidating. They are your roadmap for avoiding the chop, and playing the eventual breakout.

Put credits and call credits will work the best when price is near extremes and implied volatility is high. Calendar spreads will work best when implied volatility is low.

Let's take a look at an example to reinforce our understanding:

[RTY \(IWM\) 1 Year 1 Day Chart](

If you read my previous post you know that IWM is the small cap index - or **the index all your favorite meme stocks are in.**

Look at what it's been doing for 6+ months. Its literally in the same spot! All it's done is chop back in forth in this defined range. You can identify said range by drawing a line connecting the highs and the lows - and you will see it forms a **symmetrical triangle.** This is a common technical pattern. When coming from upside the **end result is biased bullish -** but in the mean time price is going to chop sideways, fucking your options.

In this situation, you either want to buy the low of the triangle and sell the top - or you want to buy the breakout (a daily close above or below). This is massive pattern, so the breakout will likely bring a massive move.

* **Trending Markets**

Here - you want to play on the momentum side. This means playing options where volatility works in your favor, like **regular old calls, puts - even straddles/strangles. You can get away with short dated options here.** If these are your primary method of making money - stay out of rangebound markets and only play trending ones! You have to know when it's time to sit out - **cash is a position too.**

When the market is trending is when retail is printing and social media is ripe with meme stock gains - because the vast majority of retail only knows about momentum trading and doesn't know another way exists. This is how big players like it, so they can steal your money the other 70% of the time.

Here's an example of a trending market:

[ES \(SPY\) 1 Year 1 Day Chart](

Price makes new all time highs every couple weeks ever since it broke that range that lasted from last September to last November. Until we break some of those trendlines down - you can expect it to continue - and you can ride the wave. Since it's a bullish trend - in this market you want to **buy the dip** and look for smaller technical patterns to **buy breakouts.**

However - for the best play on a trending market - you usually want to enter the moment the technical pattern that creates the trend breaks. For instance, when that IWM triangle finally breaks. This gives you the best risk rewards, since you can stop loss just below the breakout. In this case, you wanted to enter calls in November and buy the dip every drop since.

# V. TL;DR

Markets only do two things: **they consolidate - or chop within a defined range gathering energy for the next move, and they trend - or break a defined range, moving in a straight line towards a new one.** This is the basis of most technical analysis and technical patterns.

* **Rangebound Markets**

This is when a market is chopping within a clearly defined range.

In a market like this, the best strategies are mean reversion strategies. This means to buy the dip and sell the rip.

* **Trending Markets**

This is when a market is moving in one direction - breaking into a new range.

This is also when you want to buy long options. Price will move perfectly for them to profit - and theta gang usually won't be an issue.

Paysafe is the number 1 digital wallet in Igaming and is used by the top sports gambling company Draftkings. As all SPACs do now, it sold off big today with the ticker change so there has never been a better time to buy than now!

&amp;#x200B;

Essential DD on PSFE:

Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing. “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.”

Partnered with Coinbase, Roblox, Draftkings, Spotify, Fortnight, Amazon, Twitch, Microsoft/Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, Amelco, and Pointsbet among many others.

Voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method”

Paysafe has the #2 digital wallet globally with a presence in 120 countries. They own Skrill, which is enabled for CTC trading.

In Europe, where Paysafe is more known, Trustpilot rates Paysafe as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars) with over 29,000 reviews, and Skrill as “great” (4.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews, while PayPal is rated ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews. They are currently laying the groundwork for their US expansion.

Unlike any other payment processor, Paysafecard enables those without bank accounts or credit cards (the over 1.7 billion “unbanked”) to engage in online commerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.

Paysafe’s industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are slow to enter. CEO Philip McHugh: “When we talk about a deep and a wide moat, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.”

In Q1 Paysafe had $90 million in one-time expenses associated with merger and paying down $1.2 billion in debt. This means without those expenses they would have beat analysts estimates and, going forward, they are well positioned to beat analysts EPS estimates for the rest of the year.

Recent debt management, saving around $92 million annually, secures higher margins and higher profits which will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts.

Paysafe confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 growth projection which doesn’t include planned inorganic M&amp;A growth pipeline and iGaming expansion (55% CAGR).

From 2017 to 2019, under Blackstone/CVC stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion. (28% CAGR) 2020 saw revenue stagnate due to Covid-related business closures and high-risk channel exits but, even so, if you add 2020’s performance, 2017-2020 still amounts to a respectable 18% CAGR, roughly the same as PayPal’s current projected growth.

Buy rating from all seven analysts covering Paysafe, with 50-70% upside from current price but, with everything noted above, it’s clear that Paysafe would still be significantly undervalued when compared to a basket of comps (PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign) with a collective growth rate of \~12.5% (in Paysafe’s 10-13% range):

Paysafe's price based on sector peer multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75

EV/Rev ratio : $44.64

EV/FCF ratio : $44.18

Average :$46.52

Valuation Notes:

* Removed all high outliers in each category putting PSFE at $100+
* Unlike Paysafe's reported $362 million in free cash flow (on track to increase 29%) and 30%+ EBITDA margin, half of peers report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow.
* Paysafe has better EPS than over half of the peer group
* Paysafe has better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them

Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, Bill Foley, has a proven track record in generating value for his investors through rapid synergistic inorganic growth. This is a key strategic pillar for Paysafe. Over the last five years Foley has grown Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X). He says, “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.”

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: No reason for the price drop besides increasing short interest on the stock. Highly undervalued and should easily be 3x the current price minimum. It will weather the pandemic as shown with an earnings beat. High potential for short squeeze however great value/growth stock.

At the end of the day Corsair is definitely a solid long term buy, especially at these price levels but it could end up being a very good short term purchase as well if some momentum is generated behind it.

For those who know nothing about this company its basically the Chinese version of Uber

**IPO:**

Didi was one of the most overhyped IPOs advertised as ""the biggest IPO of the year"" on 30th June the day of the IPO when market opened Didi was at $14.14 it then sky rocketed to as high as $18 on the 1st of July but has been declining ever since and also took a hit with the rest of the Chinese stocks that crashed.

**Share Statistics:**

Current float: 224.66 million shares

Shares Sold Short: 59.54million

% held by institutions: **3.92%**

**Comparison to Uber:**

Ubers IPO was also a car crash trading around the $40 region on day of IPO it then dropped by 40% 10 months after IPO date and then rebounded from there after consecutive quarterly earnings reports beating expectations.  The main difference however, is that Ubers float is 1.65billion shares and ubers price is currently 5x the value of Didi globals. Didi also doesn't have a load of law suits they have to constantly fight because Chinese people dont have rights. So didis float is 7x smaller and price is 5x cheaper and Didi actually makes money. 

Whenever Uber smashed quarterly EPS we saw a surge in price, Didi has 7x less float and is 5x cheaper meaning the sentiment could surpass Ubers sentiment causing magnified effects of these price surges after earnings. Didis price is also supressed by the short shellers where as ubers is a lot more inflated.

**Will Chinese Stocks rebound?**

short answer is yes I believe they will as the market always corrects after a crash we saw this at the start of the pandemic when the entire market crashed. **Many Chinese stocks are currently undervalued** following the recent crash and its only a matter of time until they rebound just ask the retards who yolod into alibaba. 

&amp;#x200B;

**tldr**: Stonks only go up especially IPOs something about an IPO bubble. Buying after market crash = good. Current price is around $8 only $0.80  more than the all time low meaning it literally cant go tits up.

This will be a great opportunity for us outsiders to see the progress the company has made and what secrets that Elon has planned for the future. Many of us will remember Battery day, Elon promised that he would reveal a lot of the battery progress (which he did) but no one was expecting him to focus primarily on manufacturing developments. The lack of anything revolutionary caused a very disappointing near-term stock performance. AI day has the potential for $TSLA to break out of a major rut.

**Current State of Tesla AI**

Note: This is what everyone is expecting Elon to focus on and why no one is excited. All of this info is boring and no one gives a shit.

Tesla has recently launched FSD Beta V9 (Full-Self Driving), their first attempt at a vision-only self-driving software. It's got promise, but in its current state, it's not a visible improvement. Elon will claim vision + radar is a local maximum and vision only is so revolutionary... Yeah, no one cares. Reasons why this is good for the stock: you don't have to pay for that radar sensor so increase to automotive gross margin. Also, with this chip shortage, it's one less thing to worry about.

FSD Hardware v4: There's been a lot of talk recently about Tesla upgrading their latest Autopilot hardware. Many people worry that Tesla will force previous owners to pay for upgrades as recently people who lease FSD have had to pay for upgrades. None of this is that important in the long term. Expect significant hardware improvements but no one to care.

""The Button"": Tesla's latest beta is currently only available to a couple thousand drivers that have been approved. Elon has been saying for quite a while that a button will appear soon that will allow FSD buyers to finally download their software and begin testing the latest FSD. Expect a timeline update on when this button will appear that no one will believe. Elon has been promising it's right around the corner for months. If we're lucky, analysts will put some weight on this date in the short term. This button will be great for two reasons:

1. Will 10-100x the number of miles driven per day on the FSD software, vastly increasing the training data that's available to Telsa. This will increase the rate of improvement right as their vision-only system begins to plateau.
2. Will allow Tesla to recognize more revenue that they have received for FSD. Companies are not allowed to recognize revenue until they actually deliver the product or service so this button should unlock hundreds of millions in revenue with insanely high gross margin numbers.

So to conclude, this is what most people are expecting for Tesla AI day. If this is the extent of what they cover, then AI day will be a failure. Elon has stated that AI day is designed for recruitment purposes, meaning they need to unveil some exciting shit. That's why I think that there's potential for some major announcements.

**Potential Mentions that would be Major Catalysts**

* Crash Safety Improvements: It's possible to use Autopilot to avoid accidents, but it's also possible to improve the safety of accidents when they do happen. With FSD enabled, Tesla could talk about the ability to orient the car in safer positions if avoiding an accident is impossible. Without FSD, it would still be possible to notify occupants of a potential crash risk or even use the Autopilot cameras to improve airbag deployment. Tesla is known for it's crash safety and this would only help improve their brand. Most importantly, if Tesla talks about these things, it represents an increase in confidence in FSD from their engineers (not Elon) which would be major.
* Autobidder: This is their AI-driven energy trading software that's not talked about too frequently. Autobidder is for grid-scale energy storage systems to maximize the efficiency of Megapack. A big mention could be the rollout of Autobidder to Powerwall to increase income of their residential storage systems. Another important mention could be Tesla planning out their own Megapack installations and relying on Autobidder to compete in energy markets to produce revenue. Both of these would go a long way to allowing Tesla Energy to gain significant market share.
* RoboTaxi Network: Most people have heard Elon talk about self-driving cars, but so far the details of how they will actually implement a RoboTaxi Network have been sparse. Will Tesla operate their own vehicles or will they only sell the software to consumers? Is Tesla designing their own robotaxi or planning on using 25k car? There are a lot of unknowns here and clarification on some of these points can cause major changes to valuation.

**I have a full write up broken into multiple parts and I’m spending quite a bit of time on this, I hope you find it useful! If there is any organizational changes I can make to allow reading it easier, please let me know. If you find any piece of information wrong, please point it out but also explain.

Lost money, made money, but am overall better for the education! I don’t know everything and I am open to counter arguments and more details where I may have missed some. Thanks!**

***The brief summary of data:*** *CLOV option open interest on 8/20 (the number of contracts open for calls/puts) is absolutely enormous. For perspective, this Friday has a typical number of contracts for the stock. We see 77,006 calls and 31,986 puts (0.42 ratio) expiring, 8/13.*

*FRIDAY 08/20 HOWEVER, we have jaw dropping 306,424 calls, and 72,752 puts (0.24 ratio). This puts us right on track for a GAMMA SQUEEZE (details further down).*

*Earnings report showed a surprise beat on revenue (+100%), critical for growth stocks. We are at a local minimum value on the stock, so with a great earnings report, investors are eager to buy the stock. We saw this on 08/12 after earnings with the insane amount of volume (147.4million, vs the avg. of 29.22 million) fighting for the price around $9 a share.*

*These factors, plus 25% short interest (who doesn't love hearing that), mean that CLOV is ripe for a major mind melting squeeze beginning the week of the Futures contract rollover dates beginning on the Futures First Notice Day, August 26. The futures contracts are a key piece of this meme stock puzzle that many have been trying to solve.*

*This will likely peak before Sept. 9 due to futures rollover dates. Unless we see insane price action reaching margin call levels, which considering the DTCC's updated Uncleared Margin Rules (phase 5) going into effect on Sept 1st. is expected to cause a spike in margin calls.*

***TLDR: CLOV go moon before Sept 9, buy shares. Buy calls 09/03 @ $10 and 9/10 @ whatever strike suits you.***

***What the hell is a gamma squeeze and how do you predict one is going to happen?***

A gamma squeeze is a product of the derivatives (calls/puts) market. Usually this is a rare event, but with growing accessibility to the markets by retail investors, it is becoming more common. (*Tin foil hat*: this will not last forever, they will nerf this feature at some point).

***What causes the gamma squeeze?*** Unusually high call option open interest + Rise in share price + Market Maker Delta hedging.

Delta hedging is when market makers buy and sell shares in a stock to remain delta neutral. See, a Hedge fund (market maker) is intended to provide liquidity, and help you buy and sell shares. But they don't want to be on the bad side of a trade, so they remain delta neutral.

Delta is a value that affects the option price on calls and puts. It is directly related to the rate of change in stock price. So if you have a call option with a delta of 0.1, a market maker needs to buy 10 shares to hedge. A delta of 0.5 would be 50 shares, and the max delta is 1.0 or 100 shares (this would be deep in the money) The more call options open (open interest), the more market makers have to do this.

As you might be figuring out, if the market makers have to buy shares to delta hedge, and there are an immense amount of call options open, then the buying action from market makers to delta hedge can and WILL drive up the price. As retail investors continue to buy shares and the price climbs, market makers must also buy shares to delta hedge. This causes a snowballing effect called the gamma squeeze. We saw this happen with so many stocks now (AMC in June, CLOV in June).

Gamma is the value that measures the rate of change in delta. So the faster the price changes, the higher the delta, and gamma runs higher as delta changes faster. Hence why it is termed a gamma squeeze.

***How will we recognize a gamma squeeze happening? How long can it take to play out?***

The timeline for a gamma squeeze can be longer than you think. It is driven by multiple factors, and the intensity of each of these factors adds pressure to the overall squeeze. It can be broken into a few parts:

***Share buying***

As shares are bought causing a rise in the stock price, market makers must hedge by buying shares as delta rises. The faster the rise in stock price due to buying pressure, the faster delta increases and the more shares need to be purchased by market makers. This is due to the need to deliver these shares the following week as more calls become in the money. More on this below.

***Call Buying***

The more calls bought, the more shares must be purchased to delta hedge. If I purchase the $8 strike for 08/20 expiration, that call has a delta right now of 0.6. This means the market maker will purchase 60 shares to hedge against this.

In one respect, I think you can view buying calls as a way to effectively move the market as though you purchased that many shares, for a fraction of the price – hence the fact it is a leveraged bet. The current value of the call option is $59, however it would cost you $492.6 to buy $60 shares to have the same effect. (That said, please do not just YOLO call options, I’m doing a mix of calls and shares).

***Call Options Expiring ITM and their delivery***

The more calls that expire ITM on Friday, the more this impacts the price of the stock the following week. If you weren’t aware, options expiring ITM must have their shares delivered to the exerciser of the contract by T+2. If the call writer is short the stock, they must buy the stock on the market. As a result, we usually see a surge in stock price following options expiration if a large number of calls expire ITM. This surge in stock price causes a surge in delta, which further compounds the rise in price as market makers buy shares to hedge delta. It’s this T+2 option delivery, combined with futures rollover dates, that I believe is going to help catalyze the next run.

In the case of CLOV, there are absolutely staggering numbers of calls at various strikes on 08/20. See the following table from Barchart to see the numbers yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

[Open Interest on 08\/20 for CLOV strikes $1-$17.50](

***Closing Short Sales***

As share price increases and borrowable shares dwindle, the borrow fee for short positions rises. Eventually this becomes untenable for short sellers and they must purchase shares to close their positions. We’ve beaten the short squeeze scenario to death in this subreddit, so I won’t go into more details. Just for data, the most recently reported (08/10) short interest on fintel shows 22.48% of the float is short, though Ortex estimates this has increased as of Friday 08/13 to 25.58% (go figure after that price action we saw on Friday). Short sales have likely been used to suppress price prior to the massive buy up necessary due to futures contracts (see below).

***FTDS – Failures-to-deliver***

CLOV shares that failed to deliver in the first two weeks of July is a staggering number. There were 46 million shares that failed to deliver. Compare to the 22million in June, vs the 6 million in May. These shares must be delivered. FTD data for the second half of July should be available on 08/16.

46 million shares out of the public float of 133.76 million = 34.3% of the entire stocks’ float failed to deliver in the first two weeks of July.

&amp;#x200B;

[FTDs for CLOV. Massive Spike in early July during the consistent drop in stock value](

High number of shares that fail to deliver usually indicates high amounts of short selling. Additionally, after the 30th of June, it appears that skyrocketing FTDs is correlated to a consistently falling share price that sees no Tuesday recovery due to options delivery. You can see a spike each Tuesday in June due to this, followed by a drop in share value.

***READ! Futures Contracts Rollover – THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL!***

For me, this was the last piece of the puzzle on figuring out what is going on with the meme stocks. The Triple Witching day is well known, and happens when futures expiration meets quarterly option expirations, but the timeframe for equity rollover was completely unknown to me.

On 9/9 the next futures contract rollover date happens. There is evidence that much of the meme stock activity is due to someone on the bad end of a futures basket that included many of the ""meme"" stocks we love so much today.

Each major run up has been just before the futures rollover date on many more stocks than CLOV. Some of those companies show movies, other sell stuff to gamers. I don’t want to name them and get flagged for removal.

The last futures rollover date was 6/10, the week that was the peak of our last meme circus. CLOV’s peak was seen on 6/9, and the futures rollover happened the following day. CLOV stock never recovered.

Furthermore, if you look at the following table I stole from /u/criand without permission (the futures info is his DD, thanks dude, you’re a fucking hero)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;



&amp;#x200B;

[Critical dates in the June 2nd - June 9th Squeeze](

We can see that the beginning of rollovers started on May 25th, the same day we started to see CLOV climb up from $7.01/share. The following week it closed on Friday, 6/4 at $9.12/share

The next Monday 06/7, it rips up to $11.92 by close, followed by a run to a close of $22.15 on Tuesday the 06/08. Wednesday 06/09 saw a high of $28.85 and a close of $16.92, ending the squeeze. You may ask yourself why it took so long for it to run up like this? The objective is to cover at the very last minute and avoid retail traders piling on to make the problem worse. If retail traders were to push the value of the stock higher each week allowing more calls to end ITM, through the buying of shares and ITM and ATM call options, then this run will end up moving sooner and moving higher. This is the exact scenario they want to avoid, and why you have never heard this information until now.

**What to look for in confirmation?**

Market maker algorithms generally move prices to max-pain. This is where option writers are hurt the most and the least impact is placed on the market maker. When we end above the max pain level (which for 08/20 is $9.00) it puts more calls ITM, which usually leads to increased price action the following week as shares are bought to deliver for options contracts.

If it closes over $9 a share this Friday, that puts an additional 20,952 call options ITM. If we go over $10, this adds another 32,382 calls ITM. The more shares purchased this week by retail, plus the more AT THE MONEY AND IN THE MONEY CALLS will put pressure on this gamma squeeze to get started. The higher the price ends this Friday, the higher this event goes.

**How to cause the most impact on the stock price:**

If you plan to participate, I suggest buying shares and ITM or ATM call options. One method of acquiring shares is buying a call option. If you by a call option for 8/20, the $8 strike is $59. The current share price is $8.21. If you purchase the option and choose to exercise it, you can have the effect of the call’s delta forcing market makers to buy shares to hedge, plus when you exercise you can acquire 100 shares and force a higher price on Tuesday during options delivery.

My strategy involves deep ITM calls this week which I will exercise on Friday. I have the $6 strike call which will allow me to call away 100 shares for $6 each. I chose this as the shares did manage to reach $7.01 in May before the run, and I want to make sure I don’t end up OTM. I also have the 09/03 call for the $10 strike, and the 09/10 call for the $11 strike. I do not plan to exercise these calls, and instead sell them during a bullish run up during their week of expiration.

Good luck, have fun, and set yourself up to get out of this 9-5 bullshit, we deserve better!

I'll leave you with one last bullish bit of sentiment, straight from the DTCC:

* Revenue beat analyst consensus
* Reported positive earnings
* Revenue grew in all segments
* 41% Volume growth
* US volume up 68%

* Expecting Q4 ramp up - seeing strong pipeline growth in international E-commerce
* New $1 Billion sports betting market opening in Canada where Paysafe is market leader
* Acquiring  two companies SafetyPay and PagoEfectivo to establish strategic  foothold in Latin America.
* These two new acquisitions represent a smart synergistic play to expand their eCash business and create new cross selling opportunities for their other products. It also directly connects them with 90% of the banks in Latin America which is critical as a global payment processor. This way they are simultaneously expanding into North and South America.
* People seem to think Paysafe revised Q3 guidance downwards. Not so. They reaffirmed full year guidance.  Analysts set Q3 estimates too high because they assumed linear revenue progression rather than taking into account the seasonality of sports betting and Europeans going on vacation. Who would've thought sports have seasons??

Edit based on today's price action:  Criminally undervalued

* According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt).
* Based on today’s share price, its current enterprise value is only $8.1B (inclusive of debt).

Therefore:

* Since taken private, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR and its value is up only 75%.
* By comparison, in that same time, PayPal grew revenue 17.8% CAGR and its value is up 460%.

Since 90%+ of my portfolio is tied up in another play, I didn’t plan on posting anything until after. However, some [SKIN calls recently paid off]( so now I have enough for a pretty large side bet. So I’m going to introduce a stock that caught my eye. But, before I begin I want you all to watch this educational video on how Hedge’s take your money:

[The Barclays Trading Strategy that Outperforms the Market](

Since I didn’t release anything on NEGG until the [last second]( and didn’t have the time to write up a DD on SKIN before [the moon]( I wanted to change it up and inject some new blood into the pool. I have a theory that a lot of stocks on this sub are built on the backs of bagholders, so anytime I post a DD I want to make sure the setup is especially juicy and the calls cheap. Loss porn is cool and all, but it's depressing - I’m looking at you [UPST bro]( [I warned your ass to chill](

This isn’t RIDE, WKHS, WISH, CLNE — **this is PAYA** a stock with juicy profit margins, crazy revenue growth, and an asymmetric gain opportunity in the short term because calls are cheap, with whales already jumping in slapping big dick energy down on OTM calls.

Eerily, this stock has not been mentioned on reddit or any of the regular places I check for mentions, even though they 1) [murked earnings and raised guidance]( 2) [analysts keep upgrading their PTs]( 3) [announced on Friday a cashless redemption catalyst on Sep 10]( and 4) institutions are loaded to the tits with shares **(118%+)**

&amp;#x200B;



**This institutional share anomaly** will be deep dived later - but surprise surprise, since the institutions who **own all the shares are investment management firms who generally** buy and hold, the float is illiquid; since, without an actively traded float there is essentially no float. Lastly, as always there is a short angle for extra salt.

When you read this DD remember the video I posted; people are watching  [👀]( so take profits this time and cut your losses if you FOMO in at the last second. I wouldn’t be posting or throwing money down on calls unless I had a good amount of conviction that this pays out.

**Here’s the tldr summary for what’s up**

* **Solid financials.** Ex: 52% gross profit margins (Square is 28%)
* **Near-100% institutional holdings** (equals highly restricted float)
* **Major warrant dilution cancellation** catalyst (Sep 10)
* **Multiple** **major valuations** at a 60% upside.
* **IV is dirt poor** at 40% .

&amp;#x200B;



# Part 1: About + Financials

PAYA is a payment processor that has done close to $35bn in payments in 2020, projected $40bn in 2021 and is growing at a fast pace. They work through vendors, resellers, independent sales organizations, developers, etc, etc, etc., and have a bunch of different offerings depending on the sector of business, while their projected upward revenue is intense.

&amp;#x200B;



Paya has the lowest price per sales of all its competitors at 5.0 (SHOP is at 48.67 and INTU at 16.51). Gross profit margins are insane at 50.9%, compared to 23.2% for Square (SQ), and 48.4% of Paypal (PYPL). In fact, PAYA has the highest Institutional ownership of all competitors and the highest short interest.

&amp;#x200B;

[competitors: SQ, PYPL, INTU, SHOP, FISV, PSFE](

*EDIT: btw PFSE one of PAYA’s closest competitors got totally fucked on ER today*

There’s a lot to deep dive into, but it’s solid company. So solid that institutions are picking up as many shares of PAYA as possible. [Their recent Q2 ER presentation]( showed off their stellar earnings growth. It’s hard to name other companies with permanent relevancy that have **over a 50% gross profit margin**.

Couple highlights

* $135mil of cash on hand
* $244mil revenue expected in 2021
* 25% revenue growth year-over-year realized and projected
* 42% gross profit margin growth year-over-year realized and projected

&amp;#x200B;



Since the economy has reopened, PAYA’s profit margins have only been growing. Unlike most tech companies, they are not a one-and-done situation but will have permanent relevancy in the post-Covid world. In fact, they are a top-20 payment provider in the US.

[BTIG]( [Truist]( [Cannacord]( and [Credit Suisse]( have all given PAYA bullish targets with an average 56% upside. Meanwhile, institutions have just been pouring into this stock and buying more while increasing price targets.

# Part 2: Institutional Holdings: +128%

&amp;#x200B;



Okay, so this is getting good. So institutions obviously can’t hold more than 100% of shares - this is probably a small error in delayed reporting and maybe some brokers miscounting a handful of tranche locked up shares.

**However** **it is very likely that institutions hold near-100% of all shares**. The entire volume over the last 6 weeks since Q2 reporting was only 28 million shares. The largest holder, GTCR didn’t sell a share, Blackrock bought 150% more, and every single other major institution holder that reported for Q2 so far **increased** their positions.

&amp;#x200B;



What does this mean? It means that institutions and funds think this is a valuable AF company and they are holding nearly all outstanding shares. They are jacked. **And remember: if nearly all outstanding shares are being held by institutions**, **that means the effective float is tiny**. This is very important in relation to short interest\*\*.\*\*

Figuring out just how small the float is relevant to figuring out what kind of corner shorts have put themselves in. Luckily we have some good pieces of info to guide us-

* [PAYA tells us]( there are 121mil shares outstanding in their recent ER.
* [13Fs/Ds tell us]( that most institutions are holding and only small funds are trading in and out.
* [FINRA tells us]( that ***there are 7.2mil outstanding S***I.
* [Price tells us]( that only 28mil shares were traded in the last 6 weeks since June 30 Q2 reports have been filed with only a net 2.1mil share sell.

**If nearly all shares are held by institutions,** then obviously the float is highly restricted. Since we know the exact number of shorts via FINRA, we can figure out real short interest in relation to the float at different institutional holding levels.

&amp;#x200B;



After all my time in highly illiquid stocks like NEGG and others that can’t be named, it’s obvious PAYA’s float is super tight, and it seems pretty plausible institutional holdings are likely around the 90% range, if not higher. **This would correlate to a 60%-118% short percentage of the effective float.**

Additionally, from the FTD viewpoint you see a spike in [FTDs with the price bleeding up]( To me this indicates tight short constraints, and combining with what we already know leads me to the belief that there may be a supply issue. SI doesn’t have to be balls to the wall for it to matter, sometimes supply-side issues are there but not reflected in the raw SI data (e.g. NEGG, AMC). I believe that this is why it is labeled as ""Hard-to-Borrow"" on TdAmeritrade and Charles Schwab rn.

These shorts don’t realize that their positions are ticking time bombs due to the illiquid nature of the stock. They probably don’t even have a fundamentally negative view of the company and are just actively trading in and out of the stock. Spoiler: it won’t end well

# Part 3: Canceled. Warrant dilution

A lot of negative price sentiment came from market pricing in an 18mil eventual share dilution via warrant exercises. This would have been a -**15% share dilution** of current shareholders.

[Surprise](

Turns out PAYA is doing well enough that they are **forgoing $200 million** to protect share value by buying back their warrants. This is pending a vote due on Sep 10 where they already have 63.5% of “yes” votes.

For those unfamiliar with the process here, I’ll explain. Since PAYA was originally a SPAC, it has warrants. A warrant is basically a call option with a strike price of $11.50 and a 5 year term. [As stated in their S1]( PAYA originally issued 17.7mil warrants (which would eventually dilute into the stock), however last week [they dropped the news]( that they would be calling for a “cashless redemption” of the warrants at a ratio of .26 shares per warrant, and changing the dilution from the long established 17.7mil to 4.6mil.

This is bullish because

1. PAYA is saying they don’t need the cash (the 17.7mil warrants exercised would have brought them $204mil)
2. Instead of the float being diluted by 17.7mil shares, there will now be only 4.6mil shares issued. **This is a positive change of +11% which the market has not priced in.**
3. The warrants don’t have an upward cap, and can be bought as high as wanted in relation to the stock.

&amp;#x200B;



# Part 4: The Short and Long Play

**Fair value is** **at least $16.65** based on analyst coverage, warrant cashless redemption, and fundamental growth profit margins [growing at 42% YoY]( They provide services that are growing exponentially and will remain in high demand for decades + their stock has received a ridiculous number of valuations all 46% higher than current valuation **before the warrant redemption news hit**.

There is still an immediate need for the market to react to the warrant redemption. Upside is at least 11% - from current $10.21 to $11.33 just on the news Friday alone (PSA - the options market has not priced this in at all yet) not even factoring in their massive revenue guidance, short coverings, or other catalysts they have lined up.

**9/20 10c @ .60 = 733% returns at $11.33 by Sep 10**

**9/20 12.5c @ .10 = 2400% returns at $15 by Sep 10**

**11/15 15c @ .15 = 1800% returns at $17.5 in October**

&amp;#x200B;



# Part 5: TA

[The arrows are a RSI oversold indicator, and it looks like earnings FUD is over -- repeating the pattern of a rebound it showed in the last earnings. Actually, if you expand to the March 8th earnings you will see the same pattern.](

# Part 6: Option Flow

Below is a graphic from an external site that summarizes option flow. It's filtered on the last 50k orders with premium greater than or equal to 1k.  Just based on the flow and ignoring everything else we have extremely bullish premiums,  the ask side is outperforming the bid side,  with the stock showing an overall bullish sentiment going forward.

&amp;#x200B;

[Flow as of Aug 13, 2021](

I also looked back in time at historical option flow to see when  10k OI for the Aug 10p was opened, since someone pointed out to me that this OI looked suspect af. So, i found that the Aug 10p  were opened  on March 8th and 9th, and they were met with 10k calls for the Aug 15c at the same time. It seems this action corresponds to a  spread trade that was opened after PAYA's March 8th earnings.

There were also 1k Nov 12.5c  calls bought on Friday at the ask (not by me) at a price of 0.45. This explains my position, I just followed the dude/dude'et into the November's after seeing the price was in a tight consolidation intra-day.

Looking back in history:

* 850 Nov 12.5c calls bought on Aug 9th price between {0.37, 0.5}
* 1.3k Nov 12.5c calls bought Aug 3rd price between {0.45, 0.9}
* 5.4k  Nov 12.5c calls bought Aug 2nd price between {0.75, .8}

These large purchases typically account for most of the option volume for the entire day across all strikes and maturities, and you can see that a good chunk of OI was opened up in the most recent weeks. So, unless it one of you fucks, I'm thinking someone is playing on some inside information or is simply a degenerate (like me). Hence, big dick energy.

Edit: Here is a summary of the flow today

Pubmatic is an amazingly well run, undervalued company with the second highest short interest of any stock!

I am so confident this will work that I have refused to sell any of my positions for at least 2 weeks! (besides positions that expire before then obviously)

&amp;#x200B;

**Table of Contents**

1. Intro
2. About the Company
3. Short Sellers
4. Options
5. Technical Analysis
6. Conclusion

&amp;#x200B;

**About the company:**

Pubmatic (PUBM) is a digital advertising company primarily focused on ‘programmable advertising’. They are essentially the middle-man between sellers of ad space, advertisers, and consumers. Traditional digital advertising has generally been done by teams of people on either end buying and selling ad space which is super slow and costly.

What makes programmable advertising different (particularly Pubmatic) is the speed and efficiency it gets by having ad spaces grouped together into ‘nodes’ of similar content and having an algorithm decide which node an individual ad should run on.

This approach makes it so much simpler for people to sell ad space and for advertisers to reach consumers. With the vast amounts of data these algorithms get each day, they are becoming more and more effective over time at matching ads to nodes. The process of grouping ad space to nodes gives smaller advertisers a way to reach people and small creators a way to sell ad space effectively.

What generally happens is publishers will use multiple of these platforms to buy/sell ad space so they can reach as many people as possible. Because of this, there is room for multiple companies to succeed and little risk that PUBM will fail

This area is poised for MASSIVE growth in the future as the internet grows and more advertising becomes digital and programmable. Programmable advertising spending has been rapidly increasing and is now over $155B per year!



PUBM is also perfectly positioned for the whole individual creator and contractor movement as their platform gives creators a way to monetize their websites

Pubmatic’s approach has been yielding results with them garnering over 211 BILLION daily ad impressions and over 2 PETABYTES of data PER DAY! For context, that’s 2,000,000 gigabytes of data processed daily

&amp;#x200B;

**Financial Statements (based on Q2 data):**

* $49.7M revenue (just in Q2)
* 88% y/y revenue growth
* $9.9M net income
* Net income up %1419 y/y
* Adjusted EBITDA of 18.6M
* Ebitda up 278% y/y
* Gross margin of 74%
* 63 P/E
* 0 debt

This is a company who is growing rapidly and, even at this rate of growth (88%), is profitable. Once most of the infrastructure is finished and algorithm processes are streamlined, this company will be even more profitable.

PUBM has a 63 P/E, which for that rate of growth is outrageously low. A company growing at this rate should not be priced this low

PUBM literally has ZERO debt and is taking market share away from competitors, while still trading at way lower multiples than most, if not all, of them

[This was made before Q2 earnings, now it is even more grossly undervalued](

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to this, Wall Street has underestimated this company by only assuming they will make around 38 cents/share this year.

Pubmatic has literally done half of that in the second quarter alone and beat estimates by 100%! Q4 has historically been much better for them then Q2 anyways so they should  reach at least 85 cents/share or so for 2021.

This leaves the stock room for growth as they consistently beat estimates causing analysts to  raise price targets

The only reason I could see why the stock is this low is shorts over shorting and causing FUD.

&amp;#x200B;

**Data Centers:**

Pubmatic has a global network of 8 data centers allowing it to give better transfer speeds, gather higher amounts of data, and be more secure



While many of its competitors have data centers and/or offices in China, PUBM doesn’t. This means the Chinese tech crackdown will not affect Pubmatic in any way, while it may to their competitors

All of their data centers and most of their offices are in politically stable countries with a strong rule of law and a wide international reach

&amp;#x200B;

**Impacts of Covid:**

Covid has transformed how both businesses and consumers produce and consume. It has forced all of us to change how we work and shop to be more online. By most estimates, covid transformed this space by over 5 YEARS

People and businesses have found the internet to be much more convenient and productive in many situations. Online advertising will continue to grow as e-commerce and the internet in general grows too.

Pubmatic is benefiting heavily from this digital transformation in our economy

Independent work has also seen massive growth due to covid induced layoffs, unemployment checks, and improved technology. Pubmatic allows independent creators to monetize their work, so they will benefit from this movement too

&amp;#x200B;

**Management:**



The management team is solid and is boosted by their board members. Ashish Gupta is the person who really sticks out to me as he was key to Amazon’s early-mid growth. From the interviews I have seen, Rajeev Goel seems smart and invested in the success of the company

With this kind of leadership, Pubmatic is positioned to secure more and more of this growing market

Pubmatic has a bright future ahead with some analysts predicting Y/Y growth above 35% up until 2025. They are in the right place at the right time

&amp;#x200B;

**Short Sellers:**

Despite this company doing so well, short sellers have taken onto the stock and made it the second most shorted stock on the ENTIRE MARKET. The current short interest sits at around 37%, increasing M/M by 0.77% despite great Q2 earnings. Shorts haven't sold, they have doubled down!

What makes this company especially primed for a short squeeze is the low liquidity due to the voting structure of shares

There are around 11M class A shares and 38M class B shares

[

Shares issued to investors pre-ipo are class B shares and get 10X the voting power of class A shares. The thing is that if an investor or institution sells their class B share and re-buys it, it instantly turns into a class A share which gives them way less power over the company

This voting structure incentivizes anyone holding a class B share to not sell, which leads to a lower liquidity in the stock. This causes buying and selling shares to have a higher impact on the stock's price, which means a bunch of retards buying in will send the price to the MOON!

If we take away the 77.5% of shares that are basically locked away, the short interest rises to around 177.5%! Realistically some of that 77.5% will still sell, but the point still holds.

Shorts are so fucked because of this, most insiders will NOT sell. That's why most of the shorts haven’t covered even when the stock dipped into the $20s, because they physically can’t without sending the stock to the MOOON!

&amp;#x200B;

**Options:**

Since options are a derivative of the underlying stock, they are generally forward looking.

Looking at option markets is a great way to see market expectations on which way a stock will move. Market sentiment drives stocks, so a bullish options market goes a long way.

Enough call options can also trigger a gamma squeeze. Market Makers are forced to purchase shares when calls they sold become closer to being ITM, which leads to a feedback loop further increasing the stock price

PUBM has one of the most bullish options markets I have ever seen



The call/put ratio is about 3, which is insanely bullish

If the stock price manages to get close to 40$, MM’s will be forced to purchase up to 450,000 shares! On a low liquidity stock, that type of purchasing will send the stock to the MOON

The 35$ C options have high open interest and could end up pushing us up close enough to reach the 40$ option chain

This is before WSB has even gotten their grubby hands on it, I can imagine even more call options will be purchased

With the power of one options contract being worth 100 shares, I bet that WSB can manage to make this thing moon and force short sellers to cover

&amp;#x200B;

**Technical Analysis:**

I am still new to TA’s so take what I say with a grain of salt

The three key indicators I normally look at are the RSI, MACD, and the Aroon indicator

The RSI (AKA Relative Strength Index) tracks current vs historical strength or weakness of a stock based on closing prices. It is generally used to track the momentum of a stock. It also helps us know if a stock is overbought or oversold.

It is measured from 0 to 100. Generally overbought is any number above 70 and oversold is any number below 30

How it is calculated is average gains/average losses over a specific period of time. I normally use a 1 month time period to track this.

The MACD (AKA Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is based on the behavior of moving averages. The MACD indicator is great to track bullish/bearish trends

The Short term MACD line is generally calculated by subtracting a 26 period EMA (exponential moving average) from a 12 period EMA

The long term MACD line (aka the signal line) takes a 9 period EMA of the MACD line itself. The signal line is a more smoothed out version of the MACD line which allows people to see medium to long term trends easier. When the short term moving average is above the long term one, this signals an uptrend

The Aroon Indicator identifies trends in asset prices and the strength of that trend. It essentially measures the time between the highs and lows of an asset.

A score above 50 indicates a bull trend and below 50 signifies bearish trends

It is calculated by tracking the past 25 market days and finding the number of days since the last high and low

This is then plugged into the Aroon formula:

For Aroon up

(Number of periods - number of periods since highest high) / (number of periods) \*100

For Aroon down

(Number of periods - number of periods since lowest low) / (number of periods) \*100

Now that you understand the indicators, here is the chart of PUBM over the past 3 months:



The RSI is 46.47, which is a little below average, meaning that according to the RSI, the stock is slightly oversold

The short term MACD line has crossed the long term MACD line signaling a slightly bullish momentum. The MACD has been measured in 12, 26, and 9 days

The Aroon indicator sits at around 30 but has had slight upward momentum recently. This signals a slight up-trend but still bearish sentiment

This TA shows a slightly oversold stock which is beginning to have upward momentum.  I am sure that with the right catalyst and/or a bunch of retards buying in, we can set new all time highs!

Eventually short sellers will be forced to close their positions

&amp;#x200B;

**How to Profit:**

Personally I would recommend buying a mix of 25% 8/20, 50% 9/17, and 25% 10/15 call options all around $30-40 strike prices. Picking up some October calls also wouldn’t hurt. 8/20’s will be affected by theta decay a lot more than 9/17s, but they are cheaper so you can get better returns.

If you want to be safer, you could also pick up some shares

&amp;#x200B;

**My Positions:**

2 8/20 $30C, 9 8/20 $35C, 1 9/17 $30C, 5 9/17 $35C, 5 9/17 40$ C

Degenerates! Let me introduce you to a company with a cute animal as their mascot. This stock has been shorted so much in the past 2 weeks, and I want to bring some apes or in this case some hippos along for the ride. Full disclosure: I own 2000 shares and am willing to buy more tomorrow before their earnings call on Monday during AHs.

What does the company do? Hippo is a transformative homeowner's insurance company well-positioned to disrupt a $108 billion industry. Legacy insurers will be caught flat-footed in the same way Tesla disrupted the auto industry and Sofi is expected to disrupt the personal finance industry.

The spac was valued at over $6B when it was merged but has been shorted all the way down to $2.95B and the price is now at $5.27 per share as of August 15, 2021. There was zero news for the stock to go down except for being ""overvalued"". This company is now around half of the market cap since the merger and 50% less than LMND's market cap (Their biggest competitor) but yet HIPO still makes more money. This should be shown in the earnings calling happening on Monday (August 16) during after-hours. On August 13, 2021, the stock was shorted at a 78% volume ratio.

SPAC founders (RTPZ), HIPO exces are not allowed to sell for 2 years unless the price vesting is triggered which are $12.50, $15, and $20. This means if the CEO wants to sell his shares within the next 2 years this stock needs go up 137%. Also the PIPE investors bought in at $10 per share which means they are less likely to sell at almost a 50% loss. I don't know about you guys but less insider selling is good enough for me!

Also every time the stock goes up 50 cents, since the price as of market close on Friday, August 13 ($5.27). I promise I will donate $100 to the Save The Hippo fund. (link not included due to content guidelines)",$HIPO - HIPPO HOLDINGS,40,8

**Charting-** I’ll start off with the pictures because I know half of you retards can’t read. Beating Q2 earnings on July 21 caused the stock to bleed through the bottom of the channel. 

•$1.40 in earnings per share (EPS); adjusted EPS, excluding special items, of $1.37.

•Operating revenue of $33.8 billion, a result of strong sequential wireless revenue growth.

•Net income of $5.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $12.2 billion.

The stock bounced off support at 55.10 and has since begun the recovery, closing above the 20 day moving average on Friday. This presents a great buying opportunity for us, and once back inside the channel she’s got a lot of room to run.

**Buffett Likes It-** In the first quarter of 2021 Berkshire Hathaway opened a position of 146,716,496 shares in Verizon. It’s in every boomer’s dividend portfolio and now can become the right YOLO options play for degenerate gamblers like you. 

**The Infrastructure Bill-** Includes $65 billion for improving the nation’s broadband infrastructure. Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg has promised 100 million Americans will have access to speeds up to 1 Gigabit per second by March 2022, and Verizon already offers 5G Home that runs on millimeter wave technology to parts of 47 U.S. cities. When it comes to 5G, Verizon beats its competitors in games/voice/video. 

&amp;#x200B;



**Speaking of 5G-** Bidding in the next US Auction (Auction 110) for mid-band spectrum in the 3.45GHz band starts October 5. “This is a critical step toward delivering on the promise of 5G,” said FCC Acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel in a statement. “This auction will bring us closer to 5G service that is fast, secure, resilient, and most importantly, available across the country.” Mid-band spectrum is largely viewed as key for 5G services – offering more capacity for speeds than lower bands, but better propagation for distance and coverage than high-band millimeter wave. This auction has a big fat red Verizon check mark written all over it. 

**Tracfone Merger-** Last September, Verizon announced its plan to purchase Tracfone in a deal valued at more than $6 billion. The acquisition would give Verizon over 20 million new subscribers and a tighter grasp on the low-income wireless and value phone market. Verizon plans to close the deal before the end of the year, which was reiterated by Vestberg on the Q2 earnings call. The CWA, Public Knowledge, and the Benton Institute for Broadband and Society had initially criticized Verizon’s proposed purchase of Tracfone, but the groups announced last Thursday that they would be withdrawing their opposition in response to new concessions. This is a big win for Verizon in the FCC’s review of the acquisition. 

Don’t forget Verizon is the official wireless carrier of the NFL. Now that football is back, we can enjoy six Verizon commercials during every break. BULLISH.",Verizon ($VZ) – Boomer’s Dividends Are Degenerate’s Tendies,44,7

First, What the ER has shown, Then my Hopium for the week ahead.

With the latest ER showing healthy, strong growth, especially in the new markets they have entered. Its revealing that RKT will continue to grow and be profitable with any new market they enter.

One of the many FUD campaigns against RKT was that they wouldn't be able to maintain profitability, growth, and Market share attacking, because of the low margin price wars with UWMC. That seems to have proven an annoyance but that RKT would continue to build and make shitpots of money nonetheless. RKT is continuing to show the negative Nancys of the world that it can and will run cheap to gobble up market share if they need to. Run Cheap, Steal Customers, Step 3 Profit.  I've said before that when RKT receives the valuation it deserves and when the FUD is proved wrong it will be too late to join the fun. I believe this Earnings showed the BS these hedgies and banks have been spouting is wrong.

1 Billion in profit this quarter, 83.8 Billion in Closed Loan Origination Volume. That is up more than 11 Billion from Q2 2020.  With 162% growth in 2 yrs. Q2 2019 - Q2 2021



RKT Homes is GROWING. Its becoming a power house in RKTs Arsenal with 2 Billion in revenue, and 1.8 million unique monthly viewers. around 70% of transactions on this site involve a Rocket Homes agent or Rocket mortgages. One business feeding the other.

&amp;#x200B;



RKT AUTO made roughly 480 million and its not even fully released yet. I cant wait to see the kind of numbers this beast puts up in a couple quarters.

Alrighty now that all the Q2 numbers, Revenues, and boring craps out the way, on to the HOPIUM, Options Data, and important events.

I believe RKT will continue its upward momentum into the 20s this week at a minimum. Solid ER, Multiple raises in PT from different ANALysts, FUD arguments are showing less influential.

Here is the current Option Data for 8/20 according to MarketChameleon

&amp;#x200B;



Decent volume between the 18.50-19.50 range(ITM or Slightly OTM) at 22,737 with large volume on the 20-21c with 27,543. The largest strike volume being the 20c with 19,251. IV crush on the ER was not fun is definitely better than the stock was trading at pre ER.

Things that I'm excited to see play out this week.

Share Repurchase Program, Its real, its active and its been used once already(minimally but still used).



The Buyback has been a weapon flexed by RKT for a whole quarter now, but one that many Share holders has assumed was just BS. With the 10Q filed on friday evening, We can see that RKT Has 1 billion already approved for their SRP, and has already Repurchased 496k Shares between 5/1/21 and 5/31/21 with at least 991.7 million still available. This was around the time of RKT low of 16.55.

This tells me 2 things. RKT will step in to FukShorty, and that RKT has a price point they will step in at. This is no longer a ride to the ground stock for the shorts because the company can and will step in at any time.

CFO Julie Both said during the ER CC, That She believes the stock is Massively undervalued and that they have 4 billion capital on hand for Buybacks and Special Dividends to force the stock in the correct direction. This was repeated a couple times.

I believe there will be an announcement this week about those weapons at their disposal.(UPDATE** Jay Farner will be live on TechCrunch at 11:40ET 8/16/21)

And the final news to keep an eye out on is the UWMC Earnings Report. This reporting should be a win win for RKT. I for one want UWMC to have a great earnings. If they show good earnings RKT will continue upward based on the industry. And in the event of bad earnings it will only prove whose winning the Mortgage war.

That's all I got for now, It aint much but its honest....

Anyways, Yall do what you want. I know where my Calls are.

**Updated Positions** 
95 19.50c 8/20, and 58 30c 8/20, 30 23c 8/20.

No, this has nothing to do with the college sorority, so if that’s why you clicked this link you can stop reading. This stock could easily double by end of year, and I want to bring some apes along for the ride. Full disclosure I’m long 5K shares and am adding to my position. I have no affiliation with the company, I just like the stock.
 
What does the company do? Basically, they sell your data to companies so they can target marketing ads to you. Notice how every website these days asks you if they can use your data or if you agree to tracking cookies? If you click yes, odds are it goes into ZETA’s proprietary database of “opted in” individuals. ZETA advertises that they have a database of 225 million US consumers that have opted in to targeted marketing… think about that, 70% of the entire country is in ZETA’s database – so yes, that means that you personally are likely in ZETA’s database for digital marketing as an “opted in” person. They have about half a billion people if you include non US consumers. 
 
ZETA makes money by selling access to their database to companies who want you to buy something, so basically ZETA is making money by selling access to you. You can get upset by this business model, or you can just invest in them and make some money off it too. ZETA has over 300 customers that spend $1M per year on access to this database, and their average customer spends $300K per year… because of these strong metrics, ZETA’s top line is growing 39% quarter over quarter. Since they have the largest database of opted in consumers, they are just printing money by selling access to your eyeballs. 
 
Here’s some more reasons to like them
1) Recent IPO / small cap: The IPO didn’t make headlines because their market cap is barely over $1B. That means that if you get on board before this hits the radar of bigger investors, you can ride the wave up
2) Low Valuation: Enterprise Value / Revenue is 2.4x, while the rest of the software industry is around 9x. Lots of room to run 
3) Great Q2 results: the company reported a strong quarter last week as the first quarter as a public company; growing 39% revenue and was way ahead of analyst estimates. Guidance for the remainder of the year was raised
4) Analyst Price Targets: average price target is $12.60… current price is under $6
5) Company history: It’s been around for over 10 years with a strong management team.
 
TL/DR – ZETA is a cheap stock you can pick up for $6 that actually has a business plan, growing like crazy, and a proprietary database that is their competitive differentiator, and could easily be $12-$15 by year end. I like the stock and am long 5k shares",ZETA global holdings… DD,7,13

Around here we usually post a guide every few months and thought I would take the honor of writing the guide for the last few months.

This is your opportunity to get better at trading and understanding what we are talking about. 

**WSB lingo:**

GUH: An acronym meaning Good Under Heat. When someone says this about someone, it means they are really good at picking stocks during volatile times. If someone replies this to a post (even if the post is negative), go through their history and buy whatever they have posted about as it is almost always a great pick.

Yacht Club: Some sort of group of special retards that get their own private group thread. Make sure to downvote this thread whenever you see it. They are awful traders.

DD: Don't do it. This post is advice from someone to NOT buy whatever stock they mention. They attempt to play devil's advocate within their post. This is just bad takes from other people in the sub that they make fun of in their post.

8/24: The date the stock market will crash.

$SEARS: A stock that is so good its like buying Sears in the 60s.

**Options terms:**

Call: Associate this with margin call, aka when your account goes into debt. When you buy a call, you're agreeing to pay the price of the contract x 100 every day until expiry, unless the company goes bankrupt.

Put: Associate this with putting money in your account. It's the opposite of a call. When you buy a put, you're agreeing for the price of the contract x 100 to be deposited into your account every day until expiry unless the company goes bankrupt.

Theta: A multiplier on how much money you will get by buying a contract. Contracts with really high theta are sought after as they multiply your money much more than a contact with low theta.

Delta: How likely you will be to get a margin call. Contracts with high delta are bad because you have a very high risk of getting a margin call.


IV: Think of this as getting an IV of cash right into your account (bloodstream). It slowly trickles in, but the higher the IV, the faster it'll go in.",A guide to options/WSB lingo for new members,339,0

They have been scaling without competition by acquiring the largest hydroponic stores in each legalized state and driving up margins by selling private label products.

1. Stifel pointed to the conservative management guidance (CEO Darren Lampert has always guided conservatively to later destroy);
2. China port shut-down (I drove 3 states down to see wtf I was buying - all their products have USA labels etc. but all made in China, so this made sense).

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**]( Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&amp;nbsp;

- **This week is an awful week to play earnings.** Most companies are low quality, and don’t have historically big moves. Options are also priced properly in most cases, meaning there isn’t much edge to be gained on the buy side or the sell side. It’s literally all just gambling, and as a result I’m probably gonna sit this week out entirely. Pay little attention to the sample plays below, as I’ve only included them for inspiration, and in case anyone sees something I may have missed.

&amp;nbsp;

- **Selling $DNUT puts may prove to be profitable.** Although justified, Krispy Kreme has been on a downtrend since its IPO. $DNUT is literally hemorrhaging money and fundamentally the company is a terrible investment. A couple of years ago they actually went private after defrauding investors, doing shady audit practices, and literally using company money to buy back stores owned by family members of the executive board for FIVE TIMES what they were worth. More info on that [here.]( Nowadays, the stock is priced as what it is - a fraudulent, cash burning business. Earnings is priced to fail, and as a result, any semblance of positive news will likely send us going upwards. If you have the balls, selling puts may prove to be profitable. The 15P is going for $0.80 giving you a breakeven of around 5.5%. You can even pickup pennies in front of the steamroller and sell the 12.5P for $0.05, giving you a breakeven of 17%. Everyone is expecting $DNUT to fail, so if we get even a smidge of positive news, we’re going up.

&amp;nbsp;

- **$CSCO options are inefficiently priced.** This is literally the only pricing inefficiency at the time of writing. Options are pricing a 2% move, while historically Cisco moves around 5%. Given that prices remain the same or get cheaper by earnings, a strangle should net you some nice profits. If you’re poor or want a binary directional play, I’d look to buy puts. $CSCO is at ATHs so we’re probably gonna do the classic “dump after earnings regardless of the outcome“ thing that everyone seems to get tricked by. Regardless, at the time of writing, $CSCO strangles give us nice edge.

&amp;nbsp;

All that being said, there aren’t many trades to run this time round! If I notice anything extra during this week, I’ll look to keep you guys posted on my socials. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.

#Summary and Conclusion

All in all, pretty awful week for trading. Most tickers are complete garbage, and there’s little edge to be gained among those that aren’t. No shame in sitting this one out! That being said, if you see any appealing plays I’ve missed, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet]( to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment! If you want access to more trading tools, or have any specific questions or observations you’d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links within the spreadsheet or on my profile. **Happy Trading! :)**","Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation and Analysis (Q2 Week 6) - $RBLX, $NVDA, $WMT, $HD, $CSCO, $TGT, $LOW and More",84,11

SelectQuote is the pioneer of the direct-to-consumer model for various types of policies in the insurance space. The company has three primary business segments: SelectQuote Senior, SelectQuote Life and SelectQuote Auto &amp; Home.

Before we start, a few key facts:

* By 2030, all baby boomers will be 65 or older (source: the goddamn US Census)
   * 73 million boomers out in the wild…10K a day.
* Consumer buying will continue to shift away from the traditional face-to-face format as the population continues to have ever increasing access to technology (source: common sense).
   * HOW MANY FACEBOOK POSTS HAVE YOUR BOOMER PARENTS OR GRANDPARENTS POSTED IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS? That’s proof.

[Cool colors with dates. Basically, more boomers.](

Why now:

The first thing you probably did was Google who the hell SelectQuote is as you slowly rolled your eyes… all while mouthing the words “boomer” and “value investing” to yourself. Not so fast… Well, the stock is DOWN and DOWN BAD the past week. One of SelectQuotes biggest competitor’s (GoHealth: GOCO) had a less than stellar earnings report, which (in my opinion) falsely tanked the entire market segment, which has presented a great buying opportunity. I actually bought some of them too, but that's not important. That said, when a company loses 50-60% overnight, it kinda makes me want to buy it.

Anyway...

Financial points about SLQT and their previous earnings (source: few various websites that a quick google search of the below will show!)

* Q3 results: +80% revenue growth (SOLID)
   * Senior aspects up 101% YoY (SOLID)

   * EBITDA up 63% YoY (SOLID)

The ONLY aspect of SLQT’s business that I see as being “BAD” is their auto insurance segment, which dropped 33%. Good, because Boomers shouldn’t drive anyway. Safety first.

Well, what happened? Completely unrelated to last week’s decrease, when the previous totals were announced for the company’s Q3 growth, the company tanked before as well. This company spends money to make money. They also rely almost entirely on the boomers. All other areas of the business are nice, but it’s just noise. Medicare makes the world go round.

To me, the company was a “buy” even back it initially dipped. Now, my interest is absolutely peaked. 

Once the GoHealth debacle went down last week, this company (SLQT) announced earnings will be released on August 25th for Q4 and the cumulative FY.

Note: SelectQuote is trading at just 2.8x EV to Sales and 11.5x FY 2022 adjusted EBITDA. (source: Google). 

I SEE OPPORTUNITY.

Positions: 400 $22.50 calls ; also around 450 shares or something like that across a few different areas. Not important... Not really a high dollar position by me (can see my other failures that I have posted), but I think it could be a good (relatively) low risk play.

I think this goes up off earnings and retraces previous support ranges. From there, you make your own decisions.

In it he mentions that UWM's gain on sale margins were in the **""mid-to-low 80s."" Meaning** **0.80-0.85%**. They dropped margins because they can still be profitable at those levels and it would SQUEEZE THE SHIT out of all other lenders in the wholesale channel. Picture a shaved headed Tom Hanks with an earring, squeezing oranges.

Remember Mat said on the Q1 ER Call: ""*And so we think 75 to 110 this quarter -- part of that is even tied to some of the acquisition concept that we discussed or I talked about, which was understanding that we could acquire someone and spend money or we can organically do it by lowering price a little bit and acquiring their clients, their brokers.*

*But my point is 75 to 110 is what I'm guiding towards, and I feel confident about that number. And I also feel confident that we're going to grow our market share. And if we decide to ease off on the margins, everyone else will as well, and we will continue to succeed and grow. We can acquire companies with cash and stock, or we can acquire companies and acquire business with margin compression.*

*But remember, our cost to originate is substantially lower than everybody else's, and it gives us a major competitive advantage. And as I said earlier, I feel really good about where we sit right now in this quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter and a lot of opportunity to grow at UWM. And then when we're as large as we are and we take the time to take more margin, then the profits come flowing through, as you saw in the third, fourth quarter and even in the first quarter.""*

Then Tim Forrester drop the big bomb: ""*When I look at first quarter results, 53 basis points is what we calculate as our expense all in. 33 basis points was fixed. 20 was variable*.""

**UWM CAN BE PROFITABLE AT ANY MARGIN ABOVE 53 BPS. 0.53%! HOLY F\*CK!**

In response to UWM's lowered margins, the other lenders (LoanDepot, Rocket etc.) had to drop their margins in order to compete. Notice that LDI only could go as low as 1.32% whereas RKT went down to 1.16%. They could only go that low because their bloated costs make those price points the lowest they are able to go before they lose money. **UWM FINDS THEIR MAX PAIN**. HOWEVER, with the lowest cost to originate UWM is still profitable enough to MAKE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, CAPTURE MARKETSHARE.

When WS realizes that the company that is in charge of how much margin ALL MORTGAGE LENDERS can make is UWM and that other companies all have to follow UWM's lead, big things will happen.

As Mat said: ""*Yes, we are the leader, without question. People will follow us up or down the price ladder, if you think of it that way*.""

I call right here and right now that when UWMC reports and the Street sees their volume and the lengths to which UWMC will go to get that volume (slashing their margins) while still being profitable, the question of ""Where did LDI and RKT's volume go?"" will be answered and RKT AND LDI'S stocks will drop.

On August 12th, something very strange happened. The url amazon.com/affirm no longer led to an error message. In fact, it redirects to a link that says ""Pay over time with Affirm"" in the tab title, and, if you're on the app it says ""Search in Pay over time with Affirm"" in the search bar. ipad view: 

If you do a ""view page source"" you can ctrl+F and see the ""08-12"" that verifies that this url was set up on 8/12.

Now let's explore the url it redirects to. It has a specific ""node ID"" in it. 

Upon reviewing what this means, a node ID is set up for a specific category of product. For instance, this is what the url for their Kindle overview page looks like:  An identical URL with a different node ID.

It seems very unlikely they set up a specific node ID url if something wasn't brewing.

Now lets look at other evidence. A few months ago, someone noticed during checkout the word ""option"" that had not been there before, yet there was only one pay over time option. See the third line down: 

Someone also noticed that when you used to search for ""Amazon Affirm"" on google it used to come up with a robo-generated search result mentioning Affirm. They do this with basically anything you search to generate clicks. But, a couple months ago, this robo-generated search result removed as if they were trying to hide something. Here is what used to come up: 

So what could all this mean? It could be something as simple as Amazon will promote Affirm's upcoming debit card on their website, but why would they promote a competing card? At the moment Amazon only offers their own cards. Or.. it could be a full-blown partnership or buyout. We don't know, but something is going on.

Also, don't question why I was routinely visiting error message URLs. I have no life and was hoping one day I'd find something and I did.",$AMZN is up to something with $AFRM - Obsessive DD,243,13

Other than the ridiculous spike at the beginning of 2021, Baidu has traded down over 5 years. The 1 year is skewed, but if we look back at day for day, it was about $120 against current day $150. So if I had bought and held through the spike I would have still been up a very decent 25% in 1yr.

Now, Baidu has a P/E of about 7. Compare to Baba at about 23, Tencent about 21.5, JD is at 14. Stateside, mega giants Google is at 30 and Amazon is running a 57 P/E. 

Financials: assets have climbed steadily every year. They’re cash positive with money in the bank. Net Income in 2020 was about 22.5B. 

Almost every analyst I’ve read says this stock is undervalued. $200 seems assured, and long term… who knows? 33% ROI is great, but 100% if it gets anywhere near ATH would be fantastic. 

The big audacious goal he is their AI. They are the leader in China here, and I believe this will allow them some explosive growth in the future as autonomous driving becomes a reality, online search becomes increasingly driven by AI, and cloud business. This should allow it to rise above the competition from Bytedance, Tencent, Alibaba, and others for search revenue. 

The obvious elephant in the room is the Chinese government crackdown on… everything. Short term, makes this very volatile. Long term, I think things stabilize and Baidu will be well positioned when it does. 

If I did try and jump into options, I’m not sure how I would approach it. Would love to hear your thoughts (obviously not financial advice). 

Position: 30 shares at $192.

TL:DR - Baidu is undervalued with a P/E half or better than competitors. China be crazy but I believe their net cash, growing revenue, and AI research will position them for 100% growth in 12-24 months.

Two legions of believers destined to be eternally entwined in battle! On one side we have those who swear by the active fund managers and their superior returns. On the other, we have those who trust the good old index fund with all their life savings! 

[ ](

Pick your sides. It’s about time we put this argument to rest.  

**Data**

It’s one of those rare times where somebody else does all the legwork for your analysis. Almost all the data for this analysis is from the [2020 SPIVA U.S Scorecard report]( SPIVA is a division of the S&amp;P Global and has been considered as the de-facto scorekeeper in the active vs passive debate. They have produced a report every year since 2002. They have done all the dirty work of collecting and cleaning the data required for the analysis \[1\].

**Analysis \[2\]**

We will be analyzing the following types of funds

[ ](

We will be then calculating the following

a. Percentage of funds underperforming the benchmark across time periods (1, 3, 5, 10 &amp; 20 years)

b. Average fund performance (1, 3, 5, 10 &amp; 20 years – Both Equal and Asset Weighted)

The above analysis should give us conclusive evidence on which approach is better both in the short as well as long term.

**Results**

[ ](

The results are not pretty! Except for the lone one-year period for small-cap funds, most actively managed funds underperformed their corresponding index in all the other time frames across the different funds.

As we can see, these differences only become much more drastic over the long term. If you consider the Large-Cap Funds, over the last 20 years, 94% of the actively managed funds have underperformed S&amp;P500.

A similar story is repeated for Small and Mid-cap funds. We can conclude from here that it’s very unlikely that the fund you choose today will be able to beat the corresponding index over the long run.

But this is just one aspect of performance. What if you consider the average returns produced by the actively managed funds? Would they beat the market returns \[3\]?



[ ](

In both Asset and Equal weighted returns, the index funds have outperformed actively managed funds over the long run. The only place where we can say with some confidence that actively managed funds performed better is in small and mid-cap funds where returns from an actively managed fund were slightly better than the index. This again is applicable only for time periods which are lesser than five years and also you have to be diligent enough to pick the right fund at the beginning of your investment.

There are mainly two reasons I can think of why active funds are underperforming index funds

a.  The fees active funds charge add up over the long run and the market is becoming more and more efficient. While 40-50 years back, there would have been a better chance of a fund manager finding an undervalued stock, the abundance of information makes it difficult to find the diamonds in the rough. This can also be seen in the fact that active funds have relatively better success in mid and small-cap funds where there is more scope for price discovery when compared to large-cap stocks.

b.  We underestimate the changes that can happen over 20 years. The fund manager, management team, and even the fund strategy can change after seeing multiple rallies and recessions over 2 decades. So, the fund you started with would be vastly different after 20 years.

One callout here is that while benchmarking against actively managed funds, SPIVA (S&amp;P Global Subsidiary) pulled one over us!

[ ](

The benchmark is calculated with respect to the index return without considering the cost associated with investing in the index (while the actively managed fund returns are calculated after fees). While this is a very small amount (0.03% for Vanguard SP500 ETF) when compared to actively managed funds (0.7-2%), it might change our final results slightly. But I don’t think it would in any way affect the overall results as the expense ratio is negligible for index funds.

**Return Comparison considering fees**

Since some of us would have a lingering question on the impact of the index fund fee, I did some calculations on the difference in return over 20 years if you invested in different funds. (The Index returns here are calculated after incorporating the fees – 0.03%)

[ ](

This should be the final nail in the coffin for actively managed funds as in all the scenarios of our analysis, just investing in a passive index provided significantly better return over the long run.    

**Conclusion**

I am not saying that active funds are pointless. Different investors have different time horizons of investment. Active funds sometimes do tend to perform better than the index during significant market volatility. In these times, fund managers can be more selective (like converting the holdings to cash and then buying back at the bottom) whereas with index funds you will be replicating exactly what the market is going through.

But then again as we can see from our analysis, only &lt;15% of funds \[4\] beat the market in the long run (20 years). As we can see from the trends, longer time periods only work against the active fund managers. The chances of the fund making the right decision year over year reduce which is why it’s good to remember that past performance cannot be indicative of future returns.

So, to conclude, in almost all the cases, you would be better off just sticking to a passive index fund and letting it ride!

**Footnotes**

\[1\] The data provided by SPIVA is accounted for survivorship bias, compares similar funds to its benchmark rather than comparing all types to SP500, and has also split its returns into both asset and equal-weighted methods. A detailed explanation for each is given in their official scorecard.

\[2\] This analysis would be limited to the data directly provided in the SPIVA report as they have not shared the raw data used in the analysis.

\[3\] Even if 86% of all funds underperformed the market over the last 20 years, what if the rest 14% created so much alpha that on avg returns actively managed funds beat the market?

\[4\] The chances of you picking the correct fund that will outperform the market in the next 20 years are very close to the chance of you predicting the correct number in a die throw! You can check your luck [here](

Let's have a quick look at AMC and some possible scenarios for next week.

TLDR at the bottom.

The sell off has considerably slowed down in the last month, and the price has been mostly consolidating between 30 and 40 usd. Better than expected results for the third quarter, and some news announced in the earnings call on the 9th of august have led to a considerable price increase and gap up , which was quickly met with strong selling back down to support. From there, price has once again formed a double bottom and was mostly up in the following 4 or 5 trading days.

Overall, volatility and volume are down, which is good news for the bulls, because it indicates that the bears have lost some steam.

Let's have a look at the technicals.  


**Price Action**

Price is currently trading inside two wedge patterns, a small and a big one, indicated in the chart below with red and blue trend lines. If price breaks the upper red line, a rally and a test of the upper resistance of the big wedge (40usd) is likely. If it bounces off that resistance, I expect price to retest the lower red support again (30usd). A break and daily close above 40 would indicate forther upside (target 50 usd), while a break and daily close below would indicate further downside (target 25 usd)



**MACD**

The daily MACD has turned green for the first time since june. The moving averages are crossing. Overall the MACD suggest the momentum is shifting to the upside.



**RSI**

There is a bullish divergence in the RSI (Matching RSI lows while second price low was lower than the first), as well as a double bottom. Overall, the RSI indicates a decreasing bearish momentum and suggests that a (at least temporary) bottom might be in.



**TLDR - Points of interest**

Long Positions: I am looking for an entry around 30 USD if price falls down there again. I am also looking for a break of the upper red resistance for a rally to 40. If 40 breaks, I am looking at 50.

Short Positions: I am looking at a bounce either off the upper red resistance back to 30, or if that resistance breaks, a bounce off the upper blue resistance back to either the upper red trendline, or if that breaks, 30 usd. However, bears should be careful. Price is down quite a lot, never chase.

I fully expect opendoor to 🚀 irregardless of whether this partnership/acquisition does or doesn’t happen, but can only imagine how much it would pump if it were to receive the resources/visibility that would come with such a partnership.

1. Amazon “the everything store” that doesn’t sell Real Estate (yet): In popular culture, it is known that Amazon has become the world’s largest online marketplace. It succeeds in taking a cut in a huge variety of product sales, but hasn’t yet begun tapping into the enormous, trillion dollar per year market of home buying (in U.S at-least). One obvious reason comes to mind, and there are likely dozens of others that I have not yet considered.
2. Buying/Selling Real Estate is profoundly different than other product listings on Amazon: it goes without saying that the home buying process and its requirements are quite complex, in comparison to the purchasing decision flow for other products on the site (Find agent, repair and prep, open houses, financing, etc.), thus creating an online format for executing such a transaction, especially in a way that is easily digestible for users that are conditioned to enjoy niceties such as “buy in 1 click”, is a significant challenge.
3. Opendoor cracking the online home buying format: buying and selling homes through opendoor removes a lot of the above friction. At a high level, you can sell your home to opendoor totally online, with flexible closing dates &amp; video walkthroughs for required inspections to receive a cash offer, in short order. On the buy side, you can unlock homes you want to self tour (you don’t need someone to tell you that the kitchen you’re standing in is a kitchen), as well as taking care of finance and offer preparation/submission online, with all documentation in one convenient organized app/site. I encourage you to check this out for yourself, it is annoying to type this part out, as it is more comprehensively and elegantly covered in opendoor’s videos and website.
4. Amazon begins forays into Real Estate via partnership with Realogy: from what I could find, it looks like Amazon had begun their own journey into the real estate market back in 2019. They had entered in a partnership where they referred home buyers/sellers to real estate agents (for a fee), but this basically doesn’t seem to capture nearly as much of the transaction value as it would if they were to take route of opendoor, which takes the place as middle man, commandeering a significant % of each transaction.

Anti-trust law, potentially non-prohibitive for acquisitions of companies in different industries: this one is an unknown and I’m not a lawyer 😵‍💫, but on initial scan, as much heat as Amazon gets in terms of anti trust law, the acquisition of a company in a completely different industry to gain expertise needed to compete in that new industry, seems more acceptable/fair game than say horizontal merging with another general online marketplace (say eBay, alibaba or wish).

Edit: I never suggested I had insider info, in my disclaimer, on first line I state that this is a “half baked DD on why I think Amazon will acquire opendoor”.

-	Countries with the worst debt problems, a lot of debt denominated in a foreign currency, and a high dependence on foreign capital typically have severe currency weakness. This currency weakness is what causes inflations when there is a depression
-	Inflationary Depression can happen to any country but are most likely if
  - Don&amp;#39;t have reserve currency
  - Have low foreign exchange reserves
  - Have large foreign debt
  - Have large and increasing budget and/or deficit
  - Have negative real interest rates
  - History of high inflation
-	5 Stages of debt cycle. Follow the deflationary cycle until the depression stage
  - Early – Low debt levels. Productive Investments. Attraction of foreign capital due to investment returns. Usually enter into a foreign exchange market to sell their currency for the incoming foreign currency to prevent it from rising and keep their exports attractive.
  - Bubble – Good asset returns, strong capital inflows, and strong economic conditions create a self-reinforcing cycle. But debts are rising faster than incomes. Asset prices are bid up and increasingly financed by debt. Country becomes the &amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; place to invest and investors who were never involved want in which sets the country up for a reversal. Country becomes reliant on debt and foreign capital rather than productivity for gains. Stocks might average 20% per year for several years during this phase
  - Top – Bubble bursts. The inflows of capital which caused the bubble are reversed. Asset prices fall, interest rates rise and banks fail. Could come from some type of shock like a reduction in oil prices. Worry increases on the part of both asset/currency holders and policymakers who are trying to support the currency. Investors worry about their ability to get their money out which causes them to get it out while they still can
    - Central bankers first make bold statements about defending the currency
    - Central banks then try to defend their currencies but these rarely work
      - Spending down reserves
      - Raising rates
    - Last line of defense before they give up is to install capital controls which never works
  - Depression – Policy makers stop fighting and let the currency decline. A gradual and persistent currency decline causes the market to expect continued future currency depreciation which isn&amp;#39;t good. Most countries do a one-off devaluation so it catches the market off guard. Policy makers usually say they will continue to defend the currency right up until they don&amp;#39;t. After policy makers let the currency go, people push to get their money out of the currency.
    - Usually, 30% decline in the currency
    - 50% fall in equities in local currency and even worse in foreign currency
  - Normalization – Supply demand balance return. Typically takes investors a few years to return (2-3). But the price of domestic goods and labor fell with the currency making it an attractive investment for foreign investors, which helps growth

# **Hyperinflation**

-	If countries continue to prop up growth rather than bring spending in line with income. And this is done repeatedly over the years, a hyperinflation episode can result
-	Inflation psychology sets in with the public. Currency declines inspire additional flight, which causes a feedback loop
-	People totally lose faith in the currency as a store of value
-	How to invest during a hyperinflation episode – Short the currency, get your money out of the country, buy commodities (Gold), and invest in commodity industries (Gold, Oil, etc)

Below I will detail a trade I took earlier this week in Nucor (NUE). The name showed up on my Sunday scan. It was caught in a filter with several other names that were showing bullish price position and consolidation. Both “bullish” price position” and “consolidation” have strict definitions. The narrative would explain that positive remarks regarding the infrastructure bill could have a bullish impact on material / Construction companies and related industries. I can say honestly that I was not aware of any of it, and this trade was signal based and systematically executed. It is impossible for any one trader to be an expert in every field. Analysts spend careers specializing in focused areas; oil, metals, retail etc. traders are free to do anything they like, but personally I can’t see the fun in reading articles and snooping out the best opportunities. I spend my energy studying supply and demand, and when you specialize in that you can apply the principles you learn to any market in the world. I trade breakout patterns on stocks showing relative strength or weakness vs the market in both the long and short direction. I trade the under currents.

📷

&amp;#x200B;



After setting alerts on all the interesting setups over the weekend my job was to wait for them to trip. At about 945 the alert for NUE went off as it broke out of the above illustrated consolidation pattern, and I set my order. I got a decent price and it started off as an average trade. I do not recall if the news came out the day I entered or the next, but the real move started on 8/10 where it made a new all-time high (ATH). My strategy is to play one entry and one exit, and to adjust my stop either passively or aggressively based on the price action the Stock displays.

📷



The price action on both 8/10 and 8/11 allowed me to be aggressive with my trail adjusting my stop tight to the action guaranteeing a fair profit and protecting against a big pull back. The downside of this will be if the stock were to pull back and then re-rip, but in tracking my statistics I found that this exit strategy remains optimal over thousands of trades so, I follow it strictly. My stop was eventually hit on 8/12 where I collected a 3.2R profit with very little effort. NUE is still running and currently it looks like there is .3R on the table if it were to reverse on Monday.

📷



If it opens strongly on the next session, there is the potential that the top is much higher. This was a systematic and very technical trade and in writing it I find myself bored with its description (I apologize to the reader). I find that funny because I am always excited when putting on new trades, my focus is at 100% and my senses are heightened when I’m playing the game. In reading this out loud I am realizing why so many “touters” pumpers and gurus put a huge song and a dance with their moves (especially on TV). The truth is, and I am not original in saying this, the news is for sales, TV is for entertainment. The best systems are the simplest and would not make must watch TV. By tying a story or believing too much in a stock you create a handicap, you are trying to quantify emotions and feelings, as humans we are very, very bad at that. You need to be the right mix of a human and a robot.

[AMC FTDs](

&amp;#x200B;

[CLOV FTDs](

  

I know GME AMC and CLOV are not the same and I am not here to bash either GME or AMC just pointing out some similarities between the three. I support GME both AMC and GME. Full disclosure I am not the first to point out these similarities but I have looked into them myself using the charts I pulled off of the SEC Website. AL Trades is where I first heard the information about a week ago in a youtube video and I just went and did some of my own digging to confirm the information he provided. 

Looking at the Charts you see peaks in FTDs in Both GME and AMC before the price run up. **FOR GME HAPPENED 3 TIMES and THE FTD PATTERN HAS AN ERIE CORRELATION THE SHARE PRICE IMO.** 

The Peak FTDs for GME were just over 3m and GMEs Float is 56m according to Google

3m FTDs / 56m Shares = just over 5% of the float 

The Peak FTDs for AMC were just over 27M and the float according to google is 511m

27m FTDs / 511m Shares = Just over 5% of the Float 

The Peak FTDs for CLOV were just over 19m and the Float according to Google is 133M

19m FTD’s / 133m Shares = **Just over 14%**!

Another thing I want to point out is that AMC before it big run up had a mini squeeze similar to what we saw from CLOV in June. 

AMC went from around $2 to $20 then back down to $6 

CLOV went from $6 to $28 and is now in the $8 range which it has been for a couple of weeks now. Is the Bottom in for CLOV? I don’t really know but I hope so. 

**Full disclosure I am a CLOV shareholder and very bullish on CLOV from all of My research I have done and that others have done.** 

**I am not a financial adviser and this is not financial advice. Just pointing out some things I see from the Charts.**

I’m sure atleast 40 of you boiling hot egg bags have heard recently that “climate change” is heavily affecting global markets and other stupid shit (venezuela).

let’s face it, allegedly it’s getting fucking hot outside. i don’t need some stupid science bitch to tell me that. 
And this my fellow geniuses, is where the party starts.

PART 1: THE WHEAT SHORTAGE 

i can already hear you fucking retards reciting it outloud, wheat shortage? 
yeah, you fuckhead. not only has the pandemic severely effected global farming efforts but this stupid hot rock you call the sun is literally vaporizing our crops. there is approximately 42% less wheat in global circulation since 2019. 

42%!? 
yeah, the exact hit your portfolio took on those Venezulaean underground runescape gold farming market futures. You’re retarded if you think this isn’t an issue.
Side note: Puts on olive garden, only good shit they have is the breadsticks.

I shouldn’t have to elaborate on how literal radiation killing one of the largest producers of food in the world is a bad fucking thing. Less wheat = Less food = Less people = less money that jpow has to print for stimulus checks.




PART 2: WATER CRISIS 2: ELECTRIC BOOGALOO

Wait, less water? I might be retarded but i know i’m atleast 60% water. 
let me put this in simple terms for you palantards: no wawa mean less crops no crops mean no food, no food or wawa mean less people AND LESS PEOPLE MEANS LESS SURVEILANCE YOUR STOCK IS DOGSHIT AND SURE TO FAIL. $5 put PLTR LEAPS

Less water is generally a bad thing, unless ofcourse youre one of the fat degenerates who are quite literally living solely off mountain dew and frozen dino nuggets. 
It’s getting hard to believe that we are LITERALLY losing a 1v1 to a fucking gas giant. imagine being that retarded. 

but i have imagined it, and i understand now that the best thing to do is run your shower at all hours of the day. THATS RIGHT BOYS, WERE STOCKING UP ON WATER FOR THE NEXT DROUGHT. 
I have stored 500 gallons of shower water in my basement that i plan on flipping for a profit. Last month my water bill was $5,326 and i plan on atleast getting a ten bagger out of this.

Get the picture yet? we’re gonna be fucking rich.

I was buying a dozen eggs last night and the store was kind of slow since it was after dark. Some old boomer was in front of me and chatting away with the woman at the cash register. Everyone had masks on, but as soon as he spoke I recognized the voice. He was telling the lady how inflation is a good thing. She said how come inflation keeps going up but minimum wage never rises? He ignored her and pulls out a large sheet of $1 bills. He asks if she had scissors but she said no.

He looked back at me and saw the eggs and said ""You workout huh? It's good to stay healthy. I used to work out by lifting bales of hay after school in 1952. Eggs are a good source of energy, mind if I take one? "" I shrugged and told him to go ahead. He opened my pack of eggs, takes one out, lowers his mask, just throws the whole thing in his mouth shell, puts his mask back up, and begins chewing loudly. As he's chewing he's crookedly folding and ripping a sheet of dollar bills handing them to the lady individually. While he's chewing he tells me it's a great time to buy bonds. I tell him I'm good.

The store was short on change so he just pays the full dollar amount. He hands me a crooked bill that is almost ripped in half and says ""thanks pal, in the future that single egg will be worth a dollar so we will call it even""

I'm heading to my car after and I see him and another boomer arguing. There was JPOW and he's arguing with a man built like a gnome wearing a poorly fit collared shirt.

# **Principles of Navigating Big Debt Crises**

-	Policy makers have 4 levers to pull when dealing with debt
  - Austerity
  - Debt defaults/Restructurings
  - Central Bank printing money &amp;quot;QE&amp;quot;
  - Transfers of money and credit
-	The first 2 are deflationary and the latter 2 are inflationary. Which levers the policy makers pull determine who benefits and who suffers. This process is painful for everyone
-	**Template of a debt crisis**
-	Typically occur because debt and debt service costs rise faster than the incomes needed to service that debt
  - Usually, a central bank can alleviate typical debt crises by lowering interest rates, but severe crises occur when that is no longer possible. IE - 0% interest rates
  - Classically, a lot of short-term debt cycles leads to a long-term debt cycle.
-	Long term debt cycles are just bigger versions of short-term debt cycles
-	During the upswing, credit is freely available and people are willing to take on more risk
-	Credit is cut during a crisis. Asset prices fall, debtors have trouble servicing debt, investors get scared and cautious which leads to liquidity problems
-	Deflationary Depressions – typically occur in countries where most of the debt is financed by the local currency
-	Inflationary Depressions – typically occur in countries where most of the debt is financed by foreign currency
-	Positive effects of debt cycles come first; negative come later
-	Typically, the worst debt bubbles are not accompanied by high and rising inflation, but by asset price inflation financed by debt growth
  - This is because policymakers make the mistake of accommodating debt growth because they are focused on inflation and/or growth, not on debt growth itself, the asset inflations they are producing, and whether or not debts will be able to be serviced
-	It is the tightening of monetary policy that usually pops a bubble
-	No specific event or shock caused the stock market bubble to burst in 1929
-	During a severe economic downturn, protectionist/populist policies begin to rise and outrage over the governments role in &amp;quot;bailing out&amp;quot; financial institutions
-	Once policymakers shift their attention to increasing financial regulation and oversight, that typically signals the of the big debt cycle
-	It is typically the case that the first tightening or policy does not hurt stocks and the economy
-	By 1937, all currencies had all devalued a lot against Gold, but not so much against each other
-	Gold bullion is the only asset that has no counterparty risk

# **Classic Deflationary Debt Cycle**

-	Early – Debt is not growing faster than incomes. Debt is financing activities that produce growth. Known as &amp;quot;Goldilocks&amp;quot; period
-	Bubble – Debt is rising faster than incomes and this produces strong asset returns and growth. This process is generally self-reinforcing because it allows people to borrow more. This can go on for decades. These are short term cycles but lots of them adding up can lead to a long-term debt cycle
  - Usually start from Bull markets. Lower interest rates drive asset prices higher, which leads to economic growth and the ability to take on more debt
  - Lending standards are reduced as people and business lever up
  - Lenders and speculators make lots of fast/easy money which reinforces the bubble
  - As a bubble nears the top of the cycle, the economy is the most vulnerable, but people are feeling the wealthiest and the most bullish
  - The Boom encourages new speculators into the market further driving up prices
  - Humans by nature tend to move in crowds and weight recent experiences more heavily. This causes people to extrapolate too much from the recent past in both up and down markets
  - Central banks usually target inflation or inflation/growth and don&amp;#39;t target the management of bubbles, the debt growth they enable can go on to finance the creation of bubbles. And the bursting of bubbles can cause severe economic pain
  - Don&amp;#39;t only look at one metric to serve as an indicator of a debt crisis
  - Monetary policy, in many cases, helps inflate the bubble rather than constrain it
    - How to Spot a Bubble
      - Prices are high relative to traditional measures
      - Broad bullish sentiment
      - Purchases are financed by high leverage
      - New buyers enter the market
      - Buyers make very forward purchases to speculate or protect themselves from future price gains
      - Stimulative monetary policy reinflates the bubble and tight monetary policy contributes to its popping
-	The Top – prices have been driven by a lot of leveraged buying and the market gets fully long, leveraged, and overpriced, it becomes rip for reversal
  - Most often occurs when the central bank starts to tighten and interest rates rise for whatever reason
  - This causes a debt service squeeze and hurts asset prices. Which reduces the amount of money lenders are willing to lend out as they become cautious
  - Investors move from risk assets to less risky assets slowing down growth
  - A negative &amp;quot;wealth effect&amp;quot; occurs when one&amp;#39;s wealth declines, which leads to less lending and spending. This is due to both negative psychology and financial condition
  - Yield curve is usually flat or inverted
    - People are incentivized to move into cash just before the crash which itself slows down lending
  - Unemployment is low
  - The more leverage that exists and the higher the prices, the less tightening it takes to prick the bubble and the bigger the bust that follows
    - Immediate post bubble period
    - People mistakenly judge the decline to be a buying opportunity and find &amp;quot;cheap&amp;quot; stocks failing to see that earning are likely to decline much more. They extrapolate too much from the recent past
    - Wealth falls first and incomes fall later, creditworthiness worsens, which constricts lending activity, this hurt spending and lowers investments and makes borrowing more difficult
    - As asset prices fall, the lenders tighten lending standards which hurts spending and investment
    - This causes people to sell investments to raise cash which causes more driving down of prices and is a self-reinforcing cycle
-	The &amp;quot;Depression&amp;quot;
  - In a normal recession, cutting interest rates can stimulate the economy. But in a depression, rates can&amp;#39;t be cut because they are already at 0%
  - The central banks have to go to alternative ways to stimulate the economy. IE – &amp;quot;QE&amp;quot; or printing money or stimulus
  - Declines of 50% of people&amp;#39;s assets are common
  - As the depression begins, defaults and restructurings hit the various people. Especially leveraged ones (Banks)
  - Runs on banks are common
  - At this stage of the cycle, debt defaults and austerity dominate which are deflationary
  - People financial condition worsens, which makes lenders more reluctant to loan money. Which slows down the economy
  - Usually, institutions and policymakers have learned from the past, but not every depression is the same as before and this catches them off guard. It doesn&amp;#39;t tend to play out like the last one that they are defending against
  - If the central bank prints money to alleviate the credit shortage, it can cause inflation if not careful
  - A big part of this deleveraging process is that people discover that much of what they thought they of as wealth was simply other people promises to give them money. And now those promises are not being kept and that wealth isn&amp;#39;t real
  - Fear cascades through the system, and these fears feed on themselves and lead to a scramble for cash that results in a shortage (investors sell assets)
  - The depression phase is dominated by deflationary forces of debt reduction
  - The investor class experiences a tremendous loss of &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; wealth, and as a result, they become extremely defensive, they seek safety in liquid investments like bonds, gold or cash
  - The 4 options policymakers have for dealing with the depression
    - They are typically slow to react initially because they don&amp;#39;t want to bail out the people who got themselves into problems
    - Austerity – Usually the most obvious thing to do. But it doesn&amp;#39;t bring the debt and income into balance. Government revenues fall and demands for government services rise which cause deficits to rise and subsequent rise in taxes. All this is bad
    - &amp;quot;QE&amp;quot; or Printing Money – The moves come in progressively larger doses as more modest initial attempts to rectify the imbalances fail. However, those early efforts typically produce bear market rallies
    - Debt defaults/Restructurings – You have to clean out the bad debt so the flow of money can continue to return to prosperity.
    - Redistribute the Wealth – Wealth gaps increase during bubbles and they become glaring during the hard times. Political populism tends to take hold after this time period. Taxes on the rich become common talking points. Central bank purchases of assets disproportionally help the rich
    - Stocks usually fall 50%
    - Currency devaluation will usually be 50% against gold
    - Deficits widen to 6% of GDP
    - Economic activity falls about 10%
    - Unemployment is 10-15%
    - Aggressive stimulation usually occurs about 2-3 years into a depression
-	The &amp;quot;Beautiful Deleveraging&amp;quot;
  - Happens when the policymakers move the 4 levers in a balanced way
  - Printing money during this phase doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily cause inflation. It won&amp;#39;t if its offsets falling credit and the deflationary forces. If income is growing faster than debt, you will be ok. However, if debt is growing faster than income, you can have a problem.
  - But central bankers can abuse the stimulative policy&amp;#39;s and cause a &amp;quot;ugly inflationary deleveraging&amp;quot; IE – Weimer Germany in the 1920&amp;#39;s
  - Printing money and debt monetization/government guarantees are inevitable in depressions in which interest rate cuts won&amp;#39;t work (IE – Already at 0%)
  - All the deleveraging eventually led to big waves of money creation, fiscal deficits, and currency devaluations (against gold, commodities, and stocks)
  - In the end, policy makers always print money because it is the easiest
    - Austerity causes more pain than benefit
    - Big restructuring wipes out too much wealth too fast
    - Redistributing of sufficient size doesn&amp;#39;t happen without a revolution
-	Pushing on a string phase
  - Late in the cycle, the policy makers have to be careful because their stimulative policies effects have diminished.
  - Economy usually enters a low growth and low return of assets
  - The danger of this phase is that too much money printing and subsequent devaluation can cause a &amp;quot;ugly inflationary deleveraging&amp;quot; to occur
    - Monetary Policy 1
      - Usually try to lower interest rates first. If that doesn&amp;#39;t work, they go to 2
    - Monetary Policy 2
      - &amp;quot;QE&amp;quot; or printing money and buying financial assets. But over time, QE&amp;#39;s ability to stimulate the market is reduced as asset prices are high and risk premiums are low. IE – investors don&amp;#39;t want to buy expensive assets that are projected to have low returns. Investors move into cash for protection which makes further QE less and less effective
      - Sometimes at this phase, policy makers monetize debt in even larger quantities in an attempt to compensate for QE reduced effectiveness. This may provide a short-term boost but there is a real risk that prolonged monetization will lead people to question the currency&amp;#39;s suitability as a store of value. This can cause investors to rush to safe havens like Gold
      - At some point, low interest rates and low premiums on risk assets from monetary policy 2 don&amp;#39;t work anymore and policy makers look to Monetary Policy 3 to stimulate the economy
    - Monetary Policy 3 – Where the US is at in 2020
      - Puts money directly into the hands of spenders instead of investors/savers and incentivizes them to spend it
      - Government provides direct or indirect stimulus payments in many different forms
-	Normalization
  - System gets back to normal. But this usually takes 5-10 years and economic activity is slow during this time frame. And it takes investors a very long time to get comfortable taking the risk of holding equities again

# **Inflationary Depression**

-	Reserve currency countries that don&amp;#39;t have significant foreign currency debt can have inflationary depressions, they usually emerge more slowly and later in the process, after sustained and repeated overuse of stimulus to reverse a deflationary deleveraging.
-	If a reserve-currency country permits much higher inflation in order to keep growth stronger by printing lots of money, it can further undermine demand for the currency, erode its reserve currency status (IE make investors view it less as a store of wealth) and turn its deleveraging into an inflationary one",Ray Dalio Principles of Navigating Big Debt Crises Book Summary Part 1,30,2

Yesterday saw a massive 43% decline after earnings yesterday and the falling knife fell more for another 13% today. Lack luster earnings has crippled this more than a FDA vote rejecting a pharma. 

They recently made an agreement with GoodRx, the company that is almost solely used at CVS, Wags, and Rite Aid, for an EXCLUSIVE Medicare partnership. Basically, if you go to any of those big box pharmacies you use GoodRx, and now any of those people who want Medicare are going to go through GoHealth. 

Even though their earnings were a miss they still increased Internal revenue of $160.4 million by 84% compared to the prior year period. Second quarter 2021 net revenue of $196.9 million increased 55% compared to the prior year period. Medicare enrollments totaled 152,749 increased 58% compared to the prior year. 

Through all of this an updated price target of $17.00 was issued today. Even the ceo bot over 2 million dollars in shares at an $11 average. This company can take a good footing in the healthcare market by getting exclusive usage of GoodRx Medicare patients. I think Monday is going to have a huge reversal like LifeStance Health had today. This could be a massive short term play and even a long one depending on the health care sector in the next year.

Their risk management team told me that apparently their algorithm considers it a risk that SPY will run an entire fucking dollar in 60 minutes at close. Doesn’t matter that I had the calls to cover it as collateral even if i did get exercised.

They said my position was “recollateralized as a calendar spread.”

Between the cost of buying back the 1 hour deep OTM FDs and the bid ask spread on my long calls these fuckers spent $600 of my gains to force me to buy FDs from them and probably pocketed the premiums and the bid ask spread.

Absolute scam. Cancelling my account Monday and leaving nothing but bad reviews everywhere.

CEO Mat Ishbia said his company, did record business in 2020 and is thus doing a record end-of-year giveaway for its workforce, which grew to about 7,300 from about 4,800 during the year.

The free goodies surpass in value the 13 Cadillac leases and 30 Bahamas cruises that were awarded and raffled off last December at UWM's annual holiday bash at Detroit's TCF Center, which featured a live performance by the electronic/pop act The Chainsmokers.

This year's bonuses, gifts and raffle items include:

$25 million in employee bonuses for reaching three-year goals set in 2017.

A minimum $1,000 in company stock for all employees, with individual amounts based on tenure, for a total $35 million in employee-owned shares.

10 free two-year leases on either a Cadillac Escalade, XT4, XT5 or a Chevrolet Corvette.

100 all-expenses-paid trips to Miami, with lodging at the Fontainebleau Miami Beach hotel.

Raffles for free groceries for one year ($500 per month max), a free trip anywhere in the U.S. ($5,000 max), a free home remodel ($8,000 max), and for another two-year lease on a Cadillac.

“We’re celebrating the best year in company history,"" Ishbia said Friday afternoon, shortly before announcing the bonuses and giveaways at UWM's virtual holiday event. ""The bonus pools — everything is bigger than we’ve ever done because we had our best year ever.”

Mortgage companies nationwide have been doing strong business during the pandemic, largely because the drop in interest rates to historic lows led to a surge in homeowners looking to refinance their mortgages.

Ishbia said UWM has been receiving about 300 job applications a day as it hires to keep up with the booming consumer demand.
Ishbia said UWM is nevertheless poised to do even more business next year.

""We're going to do more business in 2021 than we did in 2020, and 2020 is our best year of all time by a lot,"" he said. “So we’re going to grow next year.”

Dropping 16% on no substantial news. Yes, Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to $75, but even going off that price target, the lowest price target out, the the stock is still slightly undervalued. If you look at the average price target the stock has at least 50% upside. In fact, there is not a single firm that recommends sell on MU. MU is ridiculously cheap right now with a price to book ratio of 2, and forward PE of 6. 

The reason Morgan Stanley cited in their downgrade was reduced DRAM prices as well as a projected over supply of DRAM by the end of Q4. But  do you know what else is on the horizon in the coming months? DDR5. In case you are not familiar with RAM, DDRx refers to the generation of the memory, with each  generation having more capacity and being faster than the last. Micron is set to start mass production of DDR5 later this year. Of course DDR4 prices will start to decline. DDR5 Is almost here. 

Many people also argue that DRAMs are a commodity and no one really cares about who makes the chips. While that is true, there are only 3 manufactures. Samsung, Hynix, and Micron with Micron being the only one based in the USA. The DRAM business is an Oligarchy, all members of which are keenly aware not to overproduce memory in order to keep the tendy train rolling. 

DRAM demand is also projected to explode next year as a result of a number of factors. 5g inferstucture, automotive, cell phones, and of course computers all need DRAMs. This is of course is one reason why MU only has a forward PE of 6. They are projected to make a ton of money next year.

I think the **hardest part about trading is that the market is constantly evolving**. We are creatures of habit, as a result we get complacent and think we can find a single, comfortable strategy that works an infinite amount of times. This is almost never the case; different market conditions call for different approaches. By combining this post with my last, you should **obtain a basic understanding of how you can read market conditions, and adapt with the market.**

If you [read my previous post]( you now know when money is flowing into equities, and when it is flowing into bonds, the dollar and other safe havens. You also know about the different indexes, and what basket of stocks they carry. You even know about some interesting correlations that have arisen recently related to tech and a risk off rotation.

In this one - I'm going to take it a step further, and dig a little deeper, showing you all how to tell exactly which types equities money is flowing to, and **how to use that to generate high probability trades.** In this era of passive indexation, **you are almost never just buying one stock**. You are buying one stock - and every stock correlated to it. That means, **when you are buying CLOV and PLTR - you are also buying WISH, BB, AMC, UWMC and GME.** This obviously is not a category of stocks by traditional means - but in recent times it has become one. The point is - **you are going all in on one stock and you don't even realize it.**

To avoid this phenomenon - you need to understand the different different industries present within the market. Equities all belong to at least one of these - **and will usually track the rest of the stocks within their respective industry quite closely.**

# II. The Eleven Sectors That Define The Market

There is generally believed to be eleven different sectors that equities belong to. In this section, I'll detail what each one is, **the ETF you can use to track it**, and what environment it usually outperforms in.

Also, there's two main categories for stocks: **cyclicals - which follow the business cycle, and non-cyclicals - which perform the same year round.**

# 1 - Energy (VDE)

**What It Is -**

""The energy sector is a category of stocks that relate to producing or supplying energy. The energy sector or industry includes companies involved in the exploration and development of oil or gas reserves, oil and gas drilling, and refining. The energy industry also includes integrated power utility companies such as renewable energy and coal.""

\- *Investopedia*

Basically, this sector is dominated by the oil industry. You will notice renewables will hardly effect it's price movements a vast majority of the time. While many are trying to shift away from oil, it will likely be a massive part of our economy and our market long into the future.

**When It Outperforms -**

In most situations - the energy sector is cyclical. This means when our economy is doing well and expanding - it will perform well.  When it isn't, the reverse is true. Because it is dominated by a commodity, energy companies also have no issue passing on inflation to their consumers. However, keep in mind this one is a bit special because of OPEC and their ability to influence price.

""OPEC is a cartel that **aims to manage the supply of oil** in an effort to set the price of oil on the world market, in order to avoid fluctuations that might affect the economies of both producing and purchasing countries.""

*- Investopedia*

Basically, they have most of the oil, and fix the prices to their liking. This can have some unforeseen effects on the market, so if you are trading energy you definitely want to monitor their movements.

# 2 - Materials (VAW)

**What It Is -**

""The basic materials sector is an industry category made up of businesses engaged in the discovery, development, and processing of raw materials. The sector includes companies engaged in mining and metal refining, chemical products, and forestry products.""

\- *Investopedia*

**When It Outperforms -**

The materials sector is cyclical. It is sensitive to changes in the economy and tracks it pretty closely. This is another sector that can easily pass inflation onto their consumers due to the nature of their products. It's also going to be especially sensitive to any changes in the supply and demand of raw materials worldwide.

# 3 - Industrials (VIS)

**What It Is -**

""The industrial goods sector includes stocks of companies that mainly produce capital goods used in manufacturing, resource extraction, and construction. Businesses in the industrial goods sector make and sell machinery, equipment, and supplies that are used to produce other goods rather than sold directly to consumers.""

\- *Investopedia*

Basically, the materials sector passes raw materials to the industrials sector - which converts them to products used to manufacture the final products passed on to consumers.

**When It Outperforms -**

Because it is so closely tied to how much companies are producing - this sector is also cyclical. This is yet another sector that can pass the costs of inflation onto their consumers. Subsequently, due to it's close ties with the materials sector - it will be especially sensitive to the supply and demand of raw materials.

# 4 - Consumer Discretionary (VCR)

**What It Is -**

""Consumer discretionary is a term for classifying goods and services that are considered non-essential by consumers, but desirable if their available income is sufficient to purchase them. Examples of consumer discretionary products can include durable goods, high-end apparel, entertainment, leisure activities, and automobiles.""              

\- *Investopedia*

Essentially, anything broke people can't afford, like those who went all in on WISH calls before earnings, goes in this basket.

**When It Outperforms -**

Because it depends on the income of consumers - this is also a cyclical sector. When the economy is thriving, people will have more money to blow on non-essential goods, like $120 Lululemon shorts, or tickets to Disney World.

# 5 -  Consumer Staples (VDC)

**What It Is -**

""The term consumer staples refers to a set of essential products used by consumers. This category includes things like foods and beverages, household goods, and hygiene products as well as alcohol and tobacco. These goods are those products that people are unable—or unwilling—to cut out of their budgets regardless of their financial situation.""           

\- *Investopedia*

Basically the opposite of consumer discretionary - these are things people **NEED** not things that they **WANT.**

**When It Outperforms -**

These are non-cyclical, or defensive - which means regardless of how the economy is doing they will perform more or less the same. This means when the economy is taking a turn for the worst, they will generally outperform the other sectors. This doesn't mean they are immune to business cycle changes entirely, but they are certainly much less affected by them.

# 6 - Health Care (VHT)

**What It Is -**

""The healthcare sector consists of businesses that provide medical services, manufacture medical equipment or drugs, provide medical insurance, or otherwise facilitate the provision of healthcare to patients. The healthcare sector is one of the largest and most complex in the U.S. economy, accounting for close to a fifth of overall gross domestic product (GDP). The U.S. healthcare sector benefits from a strong system of medical research and development, in cooperation with the higher education system and the technology industry. The aging U.S. population and the advancing senescence of the Baby Boomer generation are driving ongoing strong demand in the healthcare sector.""

\- *Investopedia*

**When It Outperforms -**

This one is a bit complicated because there are a few industries within the sector, namely: medical equipment, drug R&amp;D, and health insurance. The sector is non-cyclical - but each industry has it's own quirks.

The drug industry in particular often moves independently of everything else on the market, because it is highly dependent on new developments and news pieces related to potentially groundbreaking treatments. Health insurance and medical equipment is usually non-negotiable regardless of the business cycle - so it will outperform in times of economic distress, and generally perform the same year round.

# 7 - Financials (VFH)

**What It Is -**

""The financial sector is a section of the economy made up of firms and institutions that provide financial services to commercial and retail customers. This sector comprises a broad range of industries including banks, investment companies, insurance companies, and real estate firms.""

\- *Investopedia*

**When It Outperforms -**

Banks involve the supply and demand of money. They make money through fees and interest rate spreads. Banks perform well during economic expansion when companies and individuals are borrowing money. One of the main drivers of borrowing/lending is interest rates. In a rising rate environment (observed through TNX, TLT, US treasury yield curve), banks will outperform. They pay short term rates (front of curve) on their deposits, and lend money to companies or individuals at a higher interest rate (further out on the curve) capturing a difference or ""spread"" on interest paid vs received. Understanding treasury yields and how they are related to the daily price movements in the financial sector is a great place to start.

# 8 - Information Technology (VGT)

**What It Is -**

""The technology sector is the category of stocks relating to the research, development, or distribution of technologically based goods and services. This sector contains businesses revolving around the manufacturing of electronics, creation of software, computers, or products and services relating to information technology.""

\- *Investopedia*

This one really needs no introduction.

**When It Outperforms -**

This is a bit tricky due to some correlations that have arisen from 2020 onward. For most of history - most tech stocks were cyclical. However, due to COVID, extremely low interest rates, and some other factors - these assets are now being rotated into during a risk off environment - and are seen as a safe-haven. Who knows if this will stand, but it's important to understanding when money will flow there **today.** More on this can be found in my previous post, where I go into detail on this phenomenon.

# 9 - Communication Services (VOX)

**What It Is -**

""The telecommunication sector is made up of companies that make communication possible on a global scale, whether it is through the phone or the Internet, through airwaves or cables, through wires or wirelessly. These companies created the infrastructure that allows data in words, voice, audio, or video to be sent anywhere in the world. The largest companies in the sector are telephone (both wired and wireless) operators, satellite companies, cable companies, and Internet service providers.""

\- *Investopedia*

**When It Outperforms -**

This is another non-cyclical sector. Whether the economy is good or bad - people aren't going to give up communicating with each other. In today's world, everyone needs a phone - even if it's a flip phone - and everyone needs internet access. One of the interesting parts of this sectors is that it is comprised of both growth names and income names. While the larger names are more consistent with dividends, the smaller names often have more room for capital appreciation and earnings growth.

# 10 - Utilities (VPU)

**What It Is -**

""The utilities sector refers to a category of companies that provide basic amenities, such as water, sewage services, electricity, dams, and natural gas. It is a large sector, and an important part of the U.S. economy, with a market capitalization of over $1.5 trillion (as of March 2021). Although utilities are private, for-profit companies, they are part of the public service landscape—providing as they do such staples for daily living—and are therefore heavily regulated. Investors typically treat utilities as long-term holdings and use them to generate a steady income for their portfolios.""

**When It Outperforms -**

Yet another non-cyclical basket of stocks. Regardless of the business cycle, demand for utilities almost always remains constant. These are some of the most stable stocks on the market - so WSB is probably better going to forget they exist moments after reading this post.

# 11 - Real Estate (VNQ)

**What It Is -**

""Real estate is the land along with any permanent improvements attached to the land, whether natural or man-made—including water, trees, minerals, buildings, homes, fences, and bridges. Real estate is a form of real property. It differs from personal property, which are things not permanently attached to the land, such as vehicles, boats, jewelry, furniture, and farm equipment.""

*- Investopedia*

**When It Outperforms -**

Like most industries, real estate involves the supply and demand of property, both residential and commercial. Real Estate is closely related to changes in construction or development, but also heavily influenced by interest rates. Most participants are using Loan to Value (LTV), anywhere from 60-85% of the total property value; therefore, interest rate changes will impact participants' ability to borrow. Thinking through these variables, its safe to assume that real estate performs well in low interest rate environments, low-moderate commodity prices for construction, population growth, and government (both local and federal) infrastructure support. When rates rise, the debt burden increases and money is hard to borrow; which ultimately affect the ability to invest in new projects or purchase homes.

# III. Practical Applications

To use all of this information - and convert it to probabilities I can use to trade - **I perform technical analysis on each sector ETF using the 1 year 1 day chart (swing trade timeframe)**. If one is breaking out of a large setup - I can assume money is going to move there in the future. If others are forming nice setups - I know to add them to my watchlist.

After identifying a sector that is likely to become strong in the near future - **I then filter it further by finding particular stocks within the sector that have similar setups**. I usually look through the top holdings of the ETF pertaining to the sector. I do this because individual stocks are more volatile than sector ETFs and more liquid - which means there is more money to be made. If a particular stock is lagging behind the sector, it can also mean there is even more to gain than in the case of another name.

You can take this one step further and combine information from my previous posts by identifying whether we are risk on, or risk off. Cyclicals are generally going to outperform while we are risk on. Non-cyclicals will generally outperform while we are risk off.

**Example -**

Last week - I noticed financials were breaking out of a large falling wedge on the daily chart. This has a bullish bias - and indicates price will make a strong move in the near future. I didn't have to scan the ETF for this one, since all the stocks in it are household names.

[VFH \(Financials\) 1 Year 1 Day](

I also noticed BAC had formed a bull flag. This was all the information I needed to enter some October Calls which I closed today for a nice profit.

[BAC \(Financials\) 1 Year 1 Day](

Lastly, ZB was trending downwards and yields were rising. This was an environment banks outperform in - which means it enforced my probability of success even more.

You don't have to use technical analysis. This is just my preference. Many people use complex fundamental and economic analysis to determine these rotations. The important thing is understanding the environments particular sectors will outperform in.

# IV. Closing Thoughts

Let me first apologize for the wall of text. I'll do my best to summarize it for those with short attention spans in my TL;DR.

If you got through all of this, and my last post - hopefully you have a better understanding of tracking where money is going, and using that to make higher quality trades. I think this is a topic most of WSB doesn't know exists (or doesn't believe in) which causes them to lose lots of money because they are all in on meme stocks, and meme stocks haven't been in the rotation for a little while. That's not to say they won't ever be again - but for the time being the broader market has made all time highs almost daily whilst these names continue to puke their guts out.

# V. TL;DR

There's **11 sectors** within the stock market.

They are:

1. Energy **(VDE, Cyclical)**
2. Materials **(VAW, Cyclical)**
3. Industrials **(VIS, Cyclical)**
4. Consumer Discretionary **(VCR, Cyclical)**
5. Consumer Staples **(VDC, Non-Cyclical)**
6. Healthcare **(VHT, Non-Cyclical)**
7. Financials **(VFH, Cyclical)**
8. Information Technology **(VGT, Cyclical Most Of The Time)**
9. Communication Services **(VOX, Non-Cyclical)**
10. Utilities **(VPU, Non-Cyclical)**
11. Real Estate **(VNQ, Cyclical)**

Each one will be rotated into depending on different market conditions. Understanding this is important to being able to make money at any given time. I perform technical analysis to determine when each is being rotated into, but you can use any analysis you want.",Follow The Money II - Understanding Sectors And Adapting To Every Market Condition,242,13

I know for some of you, you are new to the PLTR game. After the recent run up yesterday, I know a few of you probably FOMO'd in around 25.76 and I personally thank you. Yoloing your Wendy Tendie's and  allowance into a stock you know nothing about is normal sane behavior. Here I will be short and sweet in explaining WTF PLTR actually does. 

&amp;#x200B;

Picture you're high AF watching LOTR and the munchies hit you HARD. You go to to refrigerator to see what you have.  You open the fridge and you have a lot of food but can't figure out what you want to make. Now, let's pretend you have a friend named Alex that has immaculate hair, wears workout clothes exclusively and has a barn in New Hampshire. 

  
Alex can tell you everything you have in the refrigerator, the freezer, the pantry and even the vegetables that are ready in your wife's shitty little garden. They are in separate places and you're way too lazy to be walking around everywhere. Luckily Alex brings it all together. Alex could track costs, expiration dates, quality, quantity and anything else you could imagine relating to this food. Alex could also give you a list of recipes based on the food (data) that you have or any of these other factors. Eventually Alex would get so good at this, he could tell you what you want to eat when you open the fridge. He would know you better than your wife's boyfriend knows her cervix. 

&amp;#x200B;

Alex is so smart, he constantly thinks of ways to help you except when he's swimming, playing Qigong or performing sexual activities. Alex is dedicated and he is the one you want to help you make this essential decision.

Your friend Alex's last name is Karp and he is the CEO of Palantir. The service he is providing you is what Palantir offers. This service is scalable, meaning it doesn't matter if you have 1 fridge or 42,069, it will still work. You might be OK at looking through one fridge, but you know damn well you can't look through multiple fridges high AF. None of these boomer companies can efficiently look through all these fridges either, that's why they hire PLTR.

# History of Nokia

If you've seen any of the recent Nokia posts over the last few months, a common comment you will see is: ""Nokia?!? That stock has been trading sideways for years!""

While yes that is true, it is important to understand why. Let's take a look.

**2000-2013**

Nokia dominated the mobile phone market during this time due to a quality handset. NOK traded in the $50s during the Dotcom bubble and in $30s before the housing crash. However, they never recovered after 2008 due to struggling to keep up in software as the mobile phone market started to shift to smart phones.

**2013-2019**

When Nokia realized that trying to stay in the phone space was a losing battle they sold their phone division to Microsoft in 2013. For the next 3 years, Nokia was a large company in disarray.

This did not get much better in 2016 when they acquired Alcatel-Lucent and decided to focus on networks. The merger did not go as smoothly as planned and over the next 5 years Nokia started ""trading sideways"" due to a bearish sentiment.

Some investors stuck around through all of this due to a dividend being paid out, but that was suspended in 2019 so Nokia could focus on developing its 5G mobile networks. This dropped the share price down to $3.50.

**2020-Present**

In March 2020, sentiment started to change somewhat bullish as they announced Pekka Lundmark would be taking over as CEO. Pekka worked for Nokia for a decade in the 90s and most notably served as Fortum's, a Finnish state-owned energy company, CEO from 2015 to 2020.

The bullish sentiment was shorted lived due to the pandemic crash dropping the share price to $2.42. It started to pick back up over the summer when it was announced that Pekka would take over a month earlier than planned.

This was followed by rumors that there was a chance Nokia could win Verizon's $6 billion 5G deal. Hype around this brought Nokia's price above $5 for the first time since they suspended their dividend in October 2019. But in September, it was announced that Samsung won the Verizon deal and NOK fell down to $3.78. It fell even further to $3.37 in October when the rest of the market saw a down swing.

Then it climbed back up to the low $4s, had a crazy January hitting $9.79 for about 10 seconds during to the meme stock frenzy, and has since returned to the high $3s low $4s after the Q4 earnings call.

**Pekka's Tenure**

Pekka has been in charge for 11 months during a global pandemic, but he has been able to make some progress it appears. Much of this information can be found in the Nokia 2020 Annual Report.

* He trimmed their employee size by 11,000.
* He improved their free cash flow to $2.6 billion.
* Even with the decrease in revenue he nearly doubled their operating profit (page 82).
* He drastically reduced their net deferred tax balance (page 175).
* He created four distinct business groups with plans for these groups to be shared in more detail during during Capital Markets Day on 3/18.
* He replaced Nokia's CFO, CTO, and CMO (CFO happened before he took over)
* It appears he issued new shares to leadership.
* Pekka has a stake in the company (page 67 of annual report) with a long term goal to ""Focus on increase in share price and restoration of the dividend"".
   * "" In addition, Mr. Lundmark received an award of EUR 1.3 million of restricted shares on joining to buy out the awards he forfeited on leaving his previous employer. Mr. Lundmark was invited to join the co-investment based long-term incentive arrangement (eLTI) targeted to engage senior leaders with the long-term nature of our business and share price, and purchased EUR 2.6 million of Nokia shares against which he was given a matching award of EUR 5.2 million of Nokia 2020 performance shares. This investment by Mr. Lundmark aligns him with shareholders from the start and is a sign of his commitment and engagement with the company. Delivery of actual Nokia shares would take place in 2023 subject to performance conditions""

# Bullish

Here is a list of 28 deals and partnerships Nokia has established since December 2020. Some of these deals are not massive, but they span across 6 continents.

**Largescale Network**

* 5 year Multi Billion Dollar T Mobile Deal
* 7 year Belgium deal
* Deutsche Telekom in Germany
* France's Mainland 5G Network
* 5G Network in Austria
* Telecom Italia
* Cibicom ISP in Denmark
* Polkomtel Phone Provider in Poland
* Telenor Group in Thailand
* Ooredoo in Algeria
* 5G Network in Philippines
* Tele2 in Sweden, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia
* Ecuador
* Vodafone in Australia
* Saudi Arabia
* Singapore

**Private 5G Deals**

* San Diego Gas &amp;amp;amp; Electric Private Network
* Port of Seattle
* Japanese Companies Conexio, Hitachi Kokusai, Nippon Steel, Omron and Sharp
* WEG Motor Manufacturer in Brazil
* Elisa in Finland
* Optus Stadium in Australia

**Partnerships**

* Google Cloud
* EU's Hexa-X 6G Project
* Brazil's Telecommunications R&amp;amp;amp;D Center
* AT&amp;amp;amp;T tests to deploy virtualized and open RAN
* Patents deal with Samsung
* LG Uplus trial in South Korea
*Bell Labs

**5G is the Future**

The confusing nature of 5G could be holding back the market's valuation of Nokia. 

* Nokia is currently trading at a market cap of $22-23 billion even with a 2020 revenue of $24 billion.
* A letter that Pekka recently published gives a decent explanation of what 5G is.
   * In it, he admits ""\[5G\] is exciting, but it can seem a bit abstract."" But then goes on to describe some real world examples that really helps explain it.
   * ""Our partners saw unanticipated breakdowns and production line defects drop by 30% after installing smart video sensors in our manufacturing deployments. In the logistics sector, deploying augmented reality devices cut machine monitoring costs by half. In ports, remote-controlled cranes doubled productivity and eliminated staff injuries: an incredible 100% drop.""
* This seems to suggest that there may be more uses for 5G worldwide than cellular networks.
* Nokia released a study stating that 5G could have an $8 trillion impact on global GDP by 2030.
* Nokia and Ericcson may have a duopoly on 5G with Huawei and ZTE being banned in many countries. This trend may continue.
* Some analysts have predicted massive (&amp;amp;gt;1,000%) growth in the 5G market over the next 5 years.

**Upcoming Events/Rumors**

* **Capital Markets Day (3/18/21)**
   * This is when we will get some true guidance on the future of the company. Not only will they lay out the strategic business plans for their 4 business segments as I mentioned above, but it should be when they make announcements toward potential a Dividend Reinstatement, Share Buyback, and future R&amp;amp;amp;D decisions.
* **Annual General Meeting (4/8/21)**
   * Not sure what they plan to cover during this, but I would assume it will act as a follow up to Capital Markets Day
* **Dividend Reinstatement**
   * Most signs point to Nokia investing in R&amp;amp;amp;D for a while, but based on Pekka's compensation package it should be back by 2023 at the latest.
* **Share Buyback**
   * Nokia did buy back 1.25 billion shares in 2015-16 and 1 billion shares in 2016-17. So the rumors they plan to do this again could be true. They can purchase up to a total of 550 million shares both this year and next year. 550 million because it correlates to 10% of the companies total outstanding shares.

# Bearish (Risks/Cons)

* The meme stock frenzy has a long-lasting impact on the opinion of this stock.
* The dividend is not reinstated for another 3+ years.
* Pekka does not have what it takes. Nokia is a sinking ship and cannot be turned around.
* FCF is used solely for R&amp;amp;amp;D and no shares are bought back over the next three years. The float does turn out to be too big to move significantly.
* Nokia may not be undervalued and their revenue streams may continue to decline due to network share loses and pricing erosion.
* Pekka has been very serious over the last two earning calls and things are going to get much worse/challenging before they get better.
* With a new US administration in place, the trend of banning Huawei and ZTE that they started is lifted. These two competitors then undercut Nokia pricing.
* 5G is no where near as big of an industry as the experts predict. Covid continues to slow the rollout of 5G well past 2030.
* 5G is too confusing and never gets the buy in from today's investors.

Cowan Upgrades

Cowen Upgrades $NOK Citing Execution From New Ceo

Cowen adds its praise for quarterly results, upgrading the stock to Outperform.

From here, the demand environment looks to be ""very favorable,"" the firm says.

""What has changed is NOK's improving execution; we think upward trajectory is now clear and we expect meaningful incremental improvement from here, which while helping drive incremental revenue growth should especially help margin structure, and thereby EPS and cash flow,"" analyst Paul Silverstein says.

Meanwhile, Silverstein says CEO Pekka Lundmark is following the playbook of Borje Ekholm's dramatic turn-around of Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC); he's only one year in at Nokia and ""we think it is a safe assessment that further meaningful progress and attending upside lies ahead.""

Cowen has raised its target on Nokia to $8 from $5, now implying 31.6% upside.

1. Recent Martech IPO
2. SaaS business model, 121 NRR
3. Small cap stock ($2.9 B) growing 40-50%
4. Attractive multiple valuation vs. competition with lots of opportunity to double
5. Leader in space with pricing power
6. No options sadly but maybe someone can ask?

**Introduction**

Semrush is a SaaS-based marketing tool that enables users to get detailed insights about their SEO, SEM, Social Media, Content, Display advertising. They are a leader in the space and have gotten many awards for their product offerings. They offer a number of subscriptions ranging from $99/month (annual price) to $375/month with add-ons such as additional seats or additional features that cost $50-200/month.

As someone who practices SEO and is very familiar with the space and their competition, I can definitely say SEM Rush is best in class and offers a robust suite of products that are incredibly beneficial for optimizing SEO &amp; SEM. What's amazing about their product is that it's significantly cheaper than competitor offerings. Their average deal size is around $2,100/year which is ridiculous given how much value they provide their users. They have increased their pricing earlier this year and in the Q2 earnings call, they noted that churn was stable so far (still TBD of course).

Also, SEM Rush benefits from being a leader in the search space that continues to grow exponentially per Google and Microsoft's earnings calls. Their social media marketing solutions will also be helpful given the growth of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, etc.

**Product Leadership vs. Competition**

&amp;#x200B;



Per their Q2 earnings slide, this is where they see themselves vs. their competition. Of course, they are biased, but the awards they've earned, plus the recognition they've received confirms at least some of this promotional content. In addition, as someone who has used a number of the products listed in the above screenshot, SEM Rush is definitely a leader for sure in the space relative to its competition.

Other notable competitors in the space are:

\-BrightEdge  
\-Conductor  
\-Botify  
\-DeepCrawl

The reason I bring them up is that the above solutions are considered ""Enterprise SEO"" or ""Enterprise marketing"" solutions and thus have a starting package of $1,000+/month (i.e. 5-figure contracts), given SEM Rush's core offering, I think SEM Rush can continue to position themselves as a cost-efficient leader in the space and to investors, given where competition's pricing is at, SEM Rush will have some pricing power. I would say their closest competitor that offers similar product offerings at a reasonable price is Ahrefs and from what I'm reading, they are growing quickly too.

**Financials**

&amp;#x200B;



As you can see this is a high-growth company that COVID has definitely helped accelerate too. They've accelerated revenue sequentially and their YoY revenue growth accelerated from 35% in 2020 to 45%+ in 2021. Moreover, their sequential guidance, assuming if they can beat and raise like they did last year, means that revenue could very well grow 50%+ this year and if they can continue to grow 8%+ sequentially, we should see a 35%+ growth year in FY 2022 on some already impressive growth figures.

**Gross Margin**

Gross Margins for the business have increased steadily from 2018 to present:

2018: 72.2  
2019: 75.5  
2020: 76.0  
Q2 '2021: 77.3

So this company has the potential to be very profitable with its continued margin expansion. Per their long-term targets, they hope to get GM to around 80%, so that's another 2%+. That's pretty impressive, even in the SaaS space.

**Operating Margins**

Their non-GAAP operating margins has continued to improve, where they started Q1'20 at -6% and the FY 2020 at -3.7%. In Q1 '21, they improved operating margins to 5.3% and in Q2 '21, they had operating margins of 1.2%. So they are definitely improving in this area esp. vs. last year which demonstrates their operating leverage and ability to achieve profitability. Moreover, their long-term operating margin target is 20%+.

**Net Revenue Retention**

As with any software company, net revenue retention is incredibly important since it helps fuel top-line revenue growth since existing customers are buying more (""land and expand"") and you continue to generate new business.

Their NRR in 2019 was 120%, in 2020 it was 114% largely due to COVID's impact in Q2 when everything was shut down and companies were getting lean. In Q1 '21 it was 116% and in Q2 '21 it was 121%. It seems that per the earnings call, management will continue to grow that figure with additional product offerings and add-ons.

Here's a graph from their S-1 about their existing cohorts:

**Customers**

&amp;#x200B;



They continue to grow their customer base at a decent clip, with Q2 '21 customers totaling over 76k customers this was a 29% increase YoY and 5.6% sequentially. This is definitely impressive growth and as long as they continue to ""land and expand"" it should continue to contribute to their revenue growth. In the earnings call, management noted that 10k+ ARR customers grew 50%, so they are definitely seeing some up-market momentum.

**Valuation**

As of yesterday's close, SEM Rush had a EV/S multiple of 16.06 this compares to other martech solutions such as Hubspot ($HUBS) with an EV/S of 28.3 and Sprout Social ($SPT) with an EV/S of 34.7. It appears SEM Rush is growing faster than both of these companies and thus is ripe for some multiple expansion if they can continue to grow their revenue at the rates we've seen recently. I personally think the market is still in a ""wait and see"" mode since this is a new IPO and has only had 2 earnings releases so far. If they beat and raise next quarter, I would expect some material multiple expansion, similar to what we saw with Asana ($ASAN) where it took them 3 earnings reports to grow from an EV/S of mid-20s to 50+ (I don't expect SEM Rush to attain a 50+ multiple, just saying that there is definitely an opportunity for multiple expansion as long as they demonstrate their ability to impress the market).

**Final Remarks**

I think SEM Rush is an attractive small-cap ($2.9 B market cap) with a large and expanding TAM ($20 B per their S-1) thanks to the likes of tech behemoths Google/Microsoft/Facebook. They continue to innovate with strong product offerings that provide tremendous value to marketers all around the world at a fair price.

The Travel Industry is undoubtedly the hardest hit by this pandemic. But, the vaccines have come in as a ray of hope. 

The rebound in the travel industry could only be possible in the last quarter because people got their jabs! Otherwise, the travel and hospitality sector just stumbled badly.

But the rise of Delta Variant, not only in the US but in other parts of the world is alarming. Many tourist places were shut. If this virus stays here longer….and the authorities do not devise effective measures to fight back, it can grievously hurt the travel economy! And, somewhat, Airbnb knows it well. 

If we look at the second-quarter earnings of this company- Airbnb, it has reported a revenue of $1.34bn, four times higher than the Q2 FY2020 and 10% up in 2019. Wall Street expected the company to report revenue of $1.26 bn, FactSet’s estimates tell. 

“Total nights and experiences” booked in the second quarter were 83.1m, almost 200% higher than the 2020 bookings. Analysts had expected it to be 79.2m.

In 2020, people were not allowed to travel across countries, there were reasonable restrictions but the ease of such restrictions surely showed a way to tour and travel in the summer of 2021. Though the ease in domestic travel boom owing to increasing vaccination rates and easing restrictions has helped AirbnbThe company is still clueless on how the traveling trend of the people in the fall of this year will be. Additionally, International sales are still a matter of concern. 

So, in conclusion, the surmounting **precariousness**, and the psychological-cum actual impact of the Delta variant on the travel industry is as real as it gets. Perhaps, this uncertainty is not allowing investors to bet on this stock. After the announcement of the Q2 financial report, Airbnb shares fell 3% during the extended trading session, and today in the pre-market hours, its shares slid by almost 2.5%.","Airbnb Outperformed Wall Street’s Revenue Prediction, But Why Are Retail Investors Still Hesitant To Infuse Money In Its Stock?",0,7
394,post,p3otnm,2th52,wallstreetbets,False,2021-08-13 09:38:52,https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p3otnm/pfizers_massive_upside_potential/,self.wallstreetbets,,"Pfizer has a TON of upside potential. Here are a few different reasons why it could go to the moon.

1. As of time of posting, only 50% of the US population is fully vaccinated (2 shots) against COVID and only 36.1% of the world population is fully vaccinated. (Source: [ Once Pfizer stops selling vaccine to the US, is it going to stop production? No, it will start selling to the rest of the world. Moderna just jumped 17% earlier this week when it was announced that they will start selling to Australia. We could see a 10-20% pop each times the news announce that Pfizer is selling to another country!
2. There are still debaters out there so I'm not going to argue whether the vaccine works. The bigger point is that the government is paying for the vaccines and they believe the vaccine works. Therefore, US demand will literally be capped tits high until more of the US population is fully vaccination. Even once US demand dries up, the rest of the world will still be waiting for our extra supply for a long time.
3. There are new variants. With the delta variant, Pfizer has already publicly said that a third booster will help. Imagine if the US gov announces they will start paying for 3rd vaccinations? What if an Epsilon or Zeta variant starts blowing up? Would they pay for a 4th or 5th vaccination?
4. Gain comparison. Moderna has gained 253% since January 1st, 2021, even after the latest price correction. By contrast, Pfizer has only gained 31%.
5. Solid Financials. During the last 2 earnings releases (where the effects of COVID vaccines have shown an impact), Pfizer outperformed EPS by \~+20% and +10%. Due to the current trend with COVID, I expect this to go on at least for another year.
6. This can be used as a hedge. If a new variant comes out and the S&amp;P reacts adversely to it, at least Pfizer should be able to maintain value/go up because Pfizer/moderna/biontech would be most situated to come up with a response. 

Edit: The main concern seems to be that Pfizer is too big a company for COVID vaccination revenue to move the stock price. In Q2'21, Pfizer reported $19B of revenue, of which $7.8B came from COVID shots. By contrast, Moderna reported $4.4B of revenue. I would agree if COVID shots were only &lt;10% of total revenue, but at \~40% it's a different story. (source: [ and [

Edit 2: I've recently seen some concerning data that some of the comments brought up about the Pfizer vaccine having 40% efficacy vs the delta variant. This is based off a Mayo clinic study. There is also a separate New England Journal of Medicine study that showed Pfizer was 88% effective vs the delta variant. Both sources linked below.

The Mayo clinic study itself is pretty technical and hard to read, but I think the tables in the back are easier to understand for laymen like myself. In page 20, there is a table that shows the overall efficacy rates. On or after 14 days following the second dose, 7 out of 4,198,947 had COVID-19 associated ICU admissions. 0 out of 4,199,985 had COVID-19 associated deaths.

To me, this shows that the Pfizer vaccine indeed does do a ton to prevent serious illness and death. It may not be as effective at preventing someone from actually getting delta variant, but it would sure increase your chances of survival drastically if you did get it. A 4 million people sample size is definitely large enough to be statistically significant. I hate that a lot of times, news channels pick and choose statistics without showing the whole story in order to sell views. Mayo Clinic itself even states “Mayo Clinic is aware of media reports on the scientific preprint paper comparing vaccines’ clinical effectiveness against the delta variant and breakthrough infections,"" a statement from Mayo Clinic says. ""We caution against drawing conclusions about vaccine effectiveness from a preprint study, which is intended only to be helpful to the scientific community and has not yet undergone the rigor of peer review.”

To me, the jury is still out on the efficacy of Pfizer vs the delta variant, but it sure as hell seems to prevent death and/or serious illness.

**We noticed some unusual things with both fundamentals and technicals of the company. The demand for semi-conductor products is likely to continue growing till 2030, and as seen earlier, due to supply disruptions in semi conductor manufacturing companies, all major industries like the auto industry, electronics, large appliances etc. were impacted..**

**Looking at the technicals of the company, the outlook has remained bearish for some time. The day started with huge sell orders and 200 day Moving Average (MA200) crossing  over MA50 on the daily chart., Also known as the infamous “death cross”, it is said to signal a down-trend. However, there are a few analysts who argue that it is a lagging indicator and happens after the selloff has already happened. In either case, there should be a relief rally soon to test the previous breakdown of support. The next major support for this stock is in the $50s range, which if you’re a bull, you would want to hold.**

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading Tips

Today, investors in UK-based electric vehicle (EV) startup Arrival (NASDAQ:ARVL) are seeing some pretty steep declines. In fact, shares of ARVL stock are currently down approximately 7% at the time of writing. Today’s price action seems to indicate investors are presently looking elsewhere for growth.

Source: BigPixel Photo / Shutterstock.com
However, there are a few catalysts long-term investors in this early stage EV company will like. Various catalysts saw shares of this de-SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) surge from its SPAC initial public offering (IPO) level of $10 to as high as $37 earlier this year on intense momentum among SPAC stocks. However, like many of Arrival’s de-SPAC peers, recent price action has not been favorable of late.

In fact, Arrival has lost more than two-thirds of its market value from its peak. Investors placing their bets on the EV sector appear to be focusing in on the bigger, more established players today. Accordingly, Arrival remains a high-risk, high-reward bet in the world of EV stocks.

That said, let’s dive into two key catalysts that could position ARVL stock for a nice run.

Two Catalysts Are the Key for Investors in ARVL Stock
Investors in ARVL stock are making a bet that this early stage EV company can hit its production targets. Today, executives told investors that the company is on track to begin production of its EV bus and van in 2022.

This is big news, as investors price in the timing of cash flows into their models. Any early stage EV company carries some level of execution risk. Investors betting on ARVL stock are essentially betting on the management team to do what they say they’re going to do. Indeed, this not only means on the production end of the equation but on the demand side as well. Investors are expecting updates on the company’s fulfillment plans for its key van order with UPS (NYSE:UPS). This order is expected to bring in more than $1 billion in revenue for Arrival.

Secondly, investors looking at ARVL stock will have to consider a key announcement the company made last week. Last Thursday, the company announced plans to partner with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on developing a cloud-based data platform for EV fleets. Given Microsoft’s backing for this project, many investors have begun to get excited about the technology angle with ARVL stock.

However, again, this comes back to execution. Investors seem to be waiting for tangible results on these projects before jumping aboard. Accordingly, it appears ARVL stock is one that’s likely to be volatile for some time, as investors price in these catalysts alongside operational risk.

Genworth   Financial is an american company specialising in life insurance,   private mortgage insurance (PMI) and mortgage origination.

Yawnsville right. What they do is boring, but also insanely profitable. They have a P/E of 1.7 (current price $3.66).

Now,   that is a low number, so surely they are some sort of new company or  in  serious trouble but it's been around since 1871. So why TF are they   valued so low? In short an analyst vacuum, and the GFC. June '07 it was   priced $35 by Dec '08 it was $0.90 being in the mortgage business then   was uhhh...... a bad time. They owe a large amount of money to AXA and   have some fairly large outstanding debts however these seem acheivable   to pay off (see The Catalyst). THey also have been subject to a four   year long merger aagreement with China Ocenawide, effectively cappign   the shareprice at $5, this has since been cancelled by GNW as CO   couldn't find funding.

In terms of   other major fundamentals they have a book value of $29.89, no you read   it right a PB of 0.12. To give you an idea of how this compare to  other  stocks in the same sector, the average PE is 10.3 and PB is 1.1.

# The Catalyst

GNW   are spinning off thier most successful business unit thier mortgage   company ENACT with an IPO valuation of $3.6B or $24 a share. GNW will   still own \~80% of the company.

Each   GNW share will own 1/4 of an ENACT share or $6, effectively this means   mr market values GNW at less than nothing and even then that'd give  you a  63% upside, to say nothing of the other insane fundamentals.

The IPO filing was a couple of days ago, so this will happen quite soon, however this has already been postponed once in May.

# 2 Stage FCF

FCF   analysis gives a bear case (-5% earnings growth out to 2030) of $10.14   and a bull case (10% growth) of $24.48. Book value as mentioned before   is $29.89 a share. This is not a professional FCF this is what I came  up with as there is very little in the way of analysis on the stock.

# Disclosure

I hold a positon of 553 shares in this stock.

**MINISO is a Japanese-inspired lifestyle product retailer, offering high-quality household goods, cosmetics, and food at affordable prices.** The company was founded in 2013 with the headquarter in Guangzhou, China. By the end of March, the company has opened 4,587 stores in 94 countries and regions, including the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Spain, UAE, India, and Mexico. It was listed on New York Stock Exchange on October 15, 2020.

The original mission of MINISO is to release the pressure on youth and improve the quality of their lives. With the slogan of “a better life has nothing to do with the price”, the company is committed to providing affordable products for the young. There are three core principles on which the company is based: **Affordable High Quality**, which means guiding decisions from design to materials; **Joy**, referring to the response its customers experience while in MINISO stores; and **Lighthearted**, which refers to the relaxed and happy feeling when encountering the large variety of goods available.

Giving great priority to the original design, the company has established the MINISO Design Academy (MDA) and teamed up with some of the best designers from Finland, Denmark, Norway, Spain, and South Korea to create high-quality products. Besides, the company has collaborated with world-famous brands including Coca Cola, Marvel, Hello Kitty, Sesame Street, Mickey and Minnie, Pink Panther, We Bare Bears, and Beijing’s Palace Museum, launching diverse products which have gained great popularity all over the world.

According to $MNSO’s financial report in Q3 2021FY, the revenue was RMB2.229 billion, with a YoY increase of 36.51%; the net growth was RMB356.5 million, with a YoY increase of 18.54%.

**Business model: to open chain stores**

Two parties of the model are the MINISO company and its franchisees. All the operating costs are paid by the franchisees, while the decoration, stocking, and management of the new store are taken care of by the company itself. In another word, MINISO is GP (General partner), who just manages but do not invest money, and the franchisees are LP (Limited Partner), who only contributes money and get a monthly dividend.

The company gets money from several channels. First, when a new store joins the chain, it must offer the brand fee to the company. Then the franchisees have to deliver the goods deposit when joining the chain and the goods are all supplied by the MINISO, which is another big income because both in preparation and in operation, a steady supply of goods is needed. Finally, If the franchisee opens and operates well, MINISO can take dividends together, and if it loses money or even closes down, the company pays nothing but earns the franchise fee.

**Recent moves:**

On June 23, MINISO established a cross-border e-commerce company, with a registered capital of RMB10 million, and its business scope includes stationery supplies wholesale, shoes and hats wholesale and retail, investment activities with own funds, auto parts retail, import and export of goods, etc.

On June 28, MINISO has undergone industrial and commercial changes, the registered capital increased from RMB 300 million to RMB 600 million, an increase of 100%. At the same time, the business scope added natural science research and experimental development, information system operation and maintenance services, and investment activities with its own funds.

**In July, MINISO has committed to donating RMB5 million of emergency supplies to aid the disaster relief operations in central China's Henan province, after a severe flood caused by extremely heavy rainfall in the region.** In response to the crisis, MINISO organized staff, mainly including bottled water and convenience food, to dispatch relief supplies from six warehouses across the country to support those in most immediate need.",DD on MINISO($MNSO),0,13

“Net loss was $11.1 million and net loss margin was (6.0)%, compared to net loss of $5.5 million and net loss margin of (4.0)%.”

Sure their revenue increased, but they are spending more money to get that revenue and thus losing even more money this quarter than last.  Are people not looking at the net loss, or is there something else I’m missing.

They got more active users, but the cost they are incurring to get and possibly maintain them seems like they are stretching themselves too far and too fast.  Another stretch point for the company:  Bumble Brew.  That restaurant was supposed to open July 24.  It’s still not open and there is no explanation of why on their site or a new date for when it will open.  It just says “summer 2021.”  Also this is just going to cost them more money.  If their focus is to expand into other countries why are they wasting money building restaurants in the US (during a pandemic, no less).  I didn’t see any mention of the restaurant on their earnings report, which makes me wonder if they just want us to forget about it...?

Assets adjusted from CAD to USD: $1,127,187,738.60

Current Shares Outstanding::  2,028,880,815

Current Market Price 7:59 pm 8/12/2021: $0.78

Current Market Cap AH close at 7:59 pm 8/12/2021: (2,028,880,815 \* $0.78) = $1,582,527,035.70

Literally they have 55.5 cents in assets for each share issued. 

Total Liabilities(USD) $639,718,688.60

Total Liabilities per share (USD): $0.03

Subtract $0.03 and they have $0.52 in hard assets backing your share. This is before they do any business.

Ok their revenue was up from $9.89 million to $18.4 million and they will get an additional $11 million in Q3 from Inner spirit, whatever assets Inner spirit owns will be added to this pile and their lending revenues from their latest two deals. $25,000,000 @ 5% APR and $103,000,000 @ 11.9% APR combined this is another $4.5 million per quarter in revenue. So Q3 revenue so far is at $33.9 million or estimated annual Revenue $135.6 million (to be reported Q3 2022, based on what’s already in the books and assuming no growth).

$135.6 \* 10  = fair market value of that revenue of about $1.3 billion (CAD) converted to USD =  $1.083B or another $0.53 per share 

$0.53 + $0.52 = $1.05 USD per share in hard assets and without growth that they are currently earning in today’s markets and it doesn’t include INSHFs assets or deploying the remaining $450M committed to lending (at 5% is another 22,500,000 in Revenue or at 11.9% is $53,550,000) multiply this times 10 and fair market rate for that revenue = $226M to $535.5M or another 11.1 to 26.4 cents per share.

$1.05+ $0.1875 (midpoint of 11.1 and 26.4) = $1.2375 per share estimated value before adding any assets INSHF may have.

TLDR: If share price is below $1.2375 then you are buying at a steal based on income they can reliably capture today and in the near future. This is prior to any growth that may be available. That means the $0.78 price AH closed at today 8-12-2021 is 58.65%  lower than fair market value. Literally you just have to buy and wait for the market to figure this out to gain 50% without even thinking. If a squeeze happens you can potentially net more gains. If not well profit is profit. Also, this doesn;t even account for potential growth if USA legalizes.

I bought 300 stocks of MCFE to cash in on the 4.50 the special dividend that's up for grabs, I also bought 3 in the money Puts at a strike price of 30 to cover for the possibility that the stock tanks after the ex-div date the math made sense I would come out on top no matter what happens to the stock price. Then this morning I see this.

[WTF!](

So I  looked into it and my broker told me that they will be reducing the strike price by 4.5 and gave me a link to the announcement that was made about it [here]( I can't make sense of it my Put according to the original contract are in the money but according to this they will be lowering the the strike price and that would leave me tits up.

AMZN reported impressive earnings, beating top and bottom but dropped significantly after earning. It was due to extremely high expectation, lowered Q3 revenue forecast, and big run up before the earning. And it happened to Wayfair. The same pattern also applies to ETSY. If you bought ETSY PUTs before earning and sold right after it opened, it's a two bagger.

At this point, you probably become really confident that same pattern is going to apply to EBAY. Online e-commerce, great growth in Q1, stock price close to ATH, and likely will have lowered Q3 guidance. You are right, absolutely right and EBAY actually did much worse than AMZN, ETSY, and W. It not only has soft Q3 guidance but also missed revenue and the active buyers dropped by 2%. However, the stock price did not drop more than 2% after the call and today at close, it actually closed green. At the end, IV fuked both calls and puts.

Another example is SOFI v.s. UPST. Their business overlaps and UPST up hugely after the earning. Many here bought SOFI shares and calls and think they will print but instead they get fuked.

Rule #2 It's All About Expectation

Wall Street is fine for EBAY missing revenue and user growth and soft Q3 guidance because we all know EBAY is not a hot e-commerce platform like AMZN with great growth story. If you can choose to work for one company, will you choose to work for AMZN to revolutionize cloud technologies or for EBAY to sell Pokemon cards online?

Rule #3 Look For Potential Surprise Factors And Stocks Without Too Much Runup Before Earning

PLTR and DIS did great after earning. I've been joking about PLTR ""Forever 22"" for a while. And here you go, a stock without too high an expectation (reflecting in stock price) and been flat for a while. And boom, 90% growth in commercial sector and beating the expectation, 10% up in a day.

DIS had a difficult year and stock been trailing behind other blue chips. No one seems to talk about it and buying force is weak. And DIS delivered first profitable quarter since Covid started, parks printing cash, crazy growth in subscribers (170M) as well.

TLDR: Options are risky and earning option plays can break your bank overnight. Don't naively think the same pattern will apply to different companies even it worked a few times. And avoid buying calls for high growth and high expectation companies.",How Not To Get Destroyed By Earning Play,65,7

In their earnings call today, Wish said that they are seeing very unfavorable LTV:CAC ratios (basically spending too much on marketing to acquire new customers). As a result they said they will stop spending on acquiring new customers, instead focusing on increasing engagement among existing customers. If you look at the app downloads and website views, you can get a pretty good idea of when exactly they stopped trying to acquire new customers.

Their app downloads have been on a slow decline but started absolutely plummeting in August - probably right around the time management started panicking. The situation looks particularly bad on the Apple store (which management singled out as challenging, due to their new privacy regulations), where the Wish app has left the Top 400.

The subject is too complex to be summerized so it is better to just read what PLTR's management had to say.


""Before diving into results, I'd like to share a bit of our latest product innovation, something that we deployed at the Global Information Dominance Experiments, GIDE 3 last month. We call it the meta-constellation, and it's radically changing how satellites are tasked, the latency of collection, and it's creating a fundamental link in that AI-enabled decision chain.

""Overnight, we orchestrated a meta-constellation of 237 satellites by working with an array of commercial space companies. These companies have been deploying constellations of hyperspectral, radar, and elite sensors into orbit. And we're putting all of that power directly into the hands of the frontlines, empowering the edge. It's one of the largest collaborative sensor constellations ever to see operational news.""

Palantir's meta-constellation software harnesses the power of growing satellite constellations, deploying AI into space to provide insights to decision-makers here on Earth. Our meta-constellation integrates with existing satellites, optimizing hundreds of orbital sensors and AI models, and allowing users to ask time-sensitive questions across the entire planet.

Important questions like, where are the indicators of wildfires, or how are climate changes affecting crop productivity? And when and where are naval fleets conducting operations? Meta-constellation pushes Palantir's Edge AI technology to a new frontier. As we all know, submarines present threats to the U.S. and its allies. And to protect strategic interest, allied forces need to track every submarine's deployment around the world.

And at the forefront of this challenge are anti-submarine warfare officers. They turn to meta-constellation to monitor ports across the Pacific. Let me show you a little bit about what that looks like. In response to Allied monitoring requests, meta-constellation dynamically determined, which orbiting sensors are available. Integrated through Palantir, the constellations then collaboratively scheduled coverage over each port.

""Meanwhile, Apollo for Edge AI assigns tailored AI micro models to each satellite. Running onboard the satellite, the models will automatically find submarines and stream those insights directly to users. With the mission planned, Apollo automatically reconfigures each of the satellites, pushing the right micro models into orbit. And as a software payload on board, Palantir's Edge AI platform connects complex satellite subsystems to models integrating new AI with the hardware.

The best part, my favorite part is that as it orbits, the Edge AI platform hot-swaps the right micro models in, rapidly reconfiguring the satellite. The models process imagery, they detect submarines, geo-locate them, and then determine any movement since the last collection passed, all in under a second. When the AI sees a submarine movement, that insight is directly downlinked to allied forces as the satellite passes overhead, and the anti-submarine warfare officers are notified in just minutes, empowering them to respond in a way that we've never seen before.

As you can tell, we're really excited about Palantir's meta-constellation and see it as the software that brings hundreds of satellites to bear on your hardest problem. Whether it's the anti-submarine warfare officer that I just described using it to find submarines, or first responders leveraging AI to spot wildfire signs. Meta-constellation is there to empower users"". 


After you have read all of that, you might say "" Oh a lot of fancy words, space, satellites yada yada it sounds cool, but what is the practical implication? How could PLTR generate revenue from all of this? 

Well, here is my take on this matter. Since the early 2000's, people are saying that data is the new oil. The problem is that it is not only hard to analyse, organise and visualise large amounts of different data (That is where PLTR comes into play), but it is also very hard to collect the most relevant information to your enterprise exactly when you need it. Let's say that you are the management of a multinational corporation that specialises in growing crops. There is no chance for you to know that there are signs that wildfires might erupt in Brasil and ruin your crops, or that a large ship has blocked the Suez Canal just 2 minutes ago. But what if there is a chance to know all of this. Well, that is when satellites become important. In the future there is a high-probability that most large companies will have their own satellites that will make high-quality images 24/7 which will help them to predict certain events or act as fast as possible when some disaster happens. A lot of newly-created startups like BlackSky are trying to position themselves in this market. However, the opportunities are not  concentrated only in the commercial segment. The future battlefield of the global superpowers will be in space. It is no wonder that the U.S governments has started its newest military branch the U.S Space Force just recently. ( They are already customers of PLTR). 

How could PLTR benefit from all of this? They most definitely won't be the ones sending the satellites, but they are trying to be the go to software provider when it comes to the analysation of all the data collected. As they said on earnings call, by integrating different AI micro models, they could make the satellites work together, collect and analyse the most relevant information to you and then notify you in seconds. I know that this might still sound like science fiction , but one of the most successful enterpreneurs of our time like Musk, Thiel and Jobs are on the opinion that in order to create a monopolistic trillion dollar company you need to create a product that is so innovative and futuristic that people still do not know they need it. (IPhone, Tesla). If all of this becomes a reality, PLTR's opportunities when it comes to revenue growth will be massive. Alex Karp himself said that they do not care about the short-term, but about becoming the most important software company in the world.

Here's the [Q2 2021 Shareholder Letter]( if you haven't see it yet. **TL:DR** \- Revenue down to $656 million or  6% YoY decrease.  Logistics revenue up 126% YoY, but was offset by a 29% decrease in Marketplace revenue. Long story short: WISH had a record year in Q2 2020 due to the lockdowns and increased mobile usage. The growth wasn't sustainable once things started to get back to normal. Resulting in the hard miss in earnings. Things are expected to pick back up in 2022 (guh). No forward guidance on Q3 revenue.   


**Quick Notes/Summary from the earning call:**

* Basically if you read the shareholder letter that's the first 10 minutes of prepared remarks from the CEO. 
* CFO Search: Expecting to hire a new CFO by EOY. 
* Logistics
   * No longer the #1 customer compliant that's product quality now. 
   * Expected user retention to increase due to the better logistics obviously didn't happen. 
   * Piloting Logistics as a service for non-WISH vendors. Too early to share any details, but they're encouraged by the early feedback by participants. 
   * WISH local represent 10% of total shipping volume up 3% QoQ. In some local markets WISH local represents a significant amount of shipping volume. (MX - 60%, IT/ES - 20% for example.)
   * Overall the CEO sound positive about the current state of logistics. 
* Marketing
   * Scaling back on marketing spend, until the LTV:CAC (Customer Lifetime Value to Customer Acquisition) ratio makes sense based on their data.
   * Marketing cost rose significantly due to the new iOS privacy changes. New privacy changes caused marketing to be focused on android and further drove up cost. On some platforms CPC doubled YoY and on other Cost per thousand (CPM) rose 50% YoY. 
   * TLDR:  Stop marketing spending in segments with little return. 
* Forward outlook
   * As a company they're focusing on a few initiative to make a better user experience/increase retention. Product Quality, user engagement, and app performance (basically the new ELT hires was to drive these initiatives) 
   *  Q3 to date - down 40% revenue with the core marketplace YoY.  (so another 11% QoQ). Expected to  drop further with reduction in marketing. (I believe this is what they said. Not 100% here) The marketing reduction starting  in July. Topline will be driven by significantly lower marketing spend.  Previous marketing was focused on getting new users/app installs aka why the lower marketplace revenue. 
   * Marketing expenses will still low until they feel the LTV:CAC ratio is good. Likely until 2022 when they feel their initiatives will start showing value.
* Misc
   * Looking to add more brand name/ higher quality items
   * New revenue share structure to incentive higher quality items and fast ship times.   


**Personal commentary**: **Guhhhhguuhhguuughh**. Long term sounds they know what their issues are and are working on fixing them (crackpipe amazon image) to create a sustainable business. The logistics business they're building out sounds like it could be a major revenue source especially in other countries as they further build out the business. No mentions of the payment license so unknown whats the plan there. So in summary: These bags are heavy, maybe I'll be able to get rid of them in 2022.

For those that don't know me, I wrote the original FSR dd (pinned comment has it - thanks automod)   
 In this post I will be going over what happened this week to the FSR share price and what I see happening in the future. I will be sure to keep it short

So first of all the Morgan Stanley PT was released:

"" Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley resumed coverage of Fisker’s stock at the equivalent of a buy rating, setting a 12-month price target of $40, or 122% upside over Tuesday’s share price. He set out a bullish case scenario Price target of $90"". After this, FSR rose 20% in a day. Pretty obvious, right? People see a PT higher than current price and want in.

But then Henrik goes and kills sentiment by announcing a $600 mil convertible notes offering (link in comments) "" $600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Green Convertible Senior Notes due 2026""

Now, people straight away see ""offering"" and have flashbacks to every other goddamn company that diluted like shit and messed up all hopes of their share prices rising. But this is actually bullish, contrary to popular belief.

In the words of **Dan Gonzales**, the **Investor Relations officer** for FSR:

"" Hi all. I am seeing some confusion on the board here and I wanted to try to address a couple things: 1) We've been very consistent that the $1 billion FSR raised in the SPAC funded the Ocean program to start of production. That is still the case and we don't want to touch those funds for other projects; 2) As the press release says, purpose of this fund-raising is to fund the PEAR development, and other potential exciting projects; 3) We have great balance sheet now but the time to raise add'l capital is when you can, not when you have to (like Tesla always did); 4) Converts are very standard product and generally include conversion premium. Meaning dilution doesn't happen at current price but something higher. Capped call raises that even more typically; look at other convert annc'ts for example. Just wanted to add some facts and clarification. ""

These are also ""capped call transactions"" What that means is that dilution is reduced either way, worst case scenario is still less than 20%. Also, not being due until 2026 puts faith in FSR's ability to actually produce the PEAR vehicle, which reduces the main bear thesis that FSR will never actually produce a vehicle.

So now that we have the details out of the way, (check the links if you want more info), here is my theory and how I am playing this:

&amp;#x200B;

[Finviz short data as of this morning](

&amp;#x200B;

[Marketbeat quotes 22&amp;#37; short interest as of July 15. Consistent with Finviz 20&amp;#37; yesterday, meaning shorts must be deep](

&amp;#x200B;

[15 min chart showing the previous weeks action. Note the massive gap up after PT announcement and the massive red candle before close today. 600 mil offering was the gap down](

&amp;#x200B;

[ORTEX data straight after the large red candle before close today. Looks like SI doubled on that particular candle. 4 million volume too](

&amp;#x200B;



Also interesting to note is the following, from Quant Data. If my math is correct, this is roughly 400k dollars in long term bets against Fisker.

&amp;#x200B;

[From just before close. Same time as the massive red candle](

It should be obvious what the play is here. SHORT SQUEEZE!!!!! I am not a fan of ""squeeze"" plays as 90% of them are not true squeeze potential. ""Apes"" and ""stick it to the hedgies"" types are what ruined this sub. But this, I believe is potential to make money and thats what I like.

Read my original dd to see my PT of $100 for end of year 2022, or $35 for end of 2021. At a current price that is almost 600% profit on share alone by next year. Adam Jonas seen what I see in this company, announced his PT and then the price pumped. Everyone who was short panicked, Henrik done them a favour by announcing (bullish) news that got misinterpreted as dilution, which stupid traders, theres a lot of them nowadays, decided to sell the news without researching. Shorts seen the opportunity to double down and are now 40% of the float SHORT!

If I had to make a wild guess, I would say they have an average short price of around $17.50, just assuming they were short first time at 19.40 (strong resistance according to crayons and what is resistance anyway, but a place where most sell positions were placed - aka a price heavily shorted at) and short second time at 16.50 down to 15 (the entire fucking red candle before close today)

Assuming anything above 17.50 causes pain for short positions, then it should be interesting to note the open interest on all the calls expiring tomorrow, mainly 18 and 20:

&amp;#x200B;

[Calls on the left and puts on the right. Open interest is the far right number, check out 18 and 20 calls. over 3,000 and 7,000 OI respectively.](

This research paper titled "" *A Market-Induced Mechanism for Stock Pinning*"" (found on google scholar) essentially states that unusually large OI generally results in pinning to that price by expiry. By that theory, either 18 or 20 should act as a magnet for price all day tomorrow. From the paper: ""**We argue that if the open interest on a particular contract is unusually large, Delta-hedging in aggregate by floor market-makers can impact the stock price and drive it to the strike price of the option**"".

Positions: 500 FSR shares at 15.50 at 5:1 leverage (been in since May, and accumulating since, dollar cost averaging). Price target is $100 by next year, and I will likely keep dipping in and out until then, mainly holding a core position of shares

Tl;dr is the same as always: Read the whole fucking thing you half-assed dimwit, your fucking wife ain't gonna be proud to be married to a bum too lazy to do some actual reading.

Shorts and Hedgies have been playing around this stock for a long time and Every Retail
Investor was irritated by that, Good results - price down, new deals - price down, positive announcements - price down, how long this could go on… even last night many were skeptical with the expected Good Earnings report by saying - PLTR GOOD EARNINGS = Price Down… such was the mentality of frustrated investors for so long…

Finally, PLTR turned the tables, and the stock price started climbing up. Funny part is : just after the Good Earnings report - shorts were scared and started their bombardment of negative PLTR sentiments on Stockwits by trying to scare the bullish investors. Even when Palantir was at 24$ today - Bears tried to convince all to take the profit and run away 😂 but This time their trick didn’t work…

Couple of months back, $PLTR had touched 40$ line, but then got pulled back, but now with another great earning report and easily achievable guidance value - Palantir is going to Shine on top of all and if retail
Investors realize it’s worth and stay bullish behind it then it can easily cross 40$ again and may be even 50$+ 
Remember, $PLTR is not a meme stock (in a way it can be though, lol) - but a REAL COMPANY WITH AWESOME TRACK RCORD, Good Earnings, Incremental Focussed growth, great management team, Top of the Shelf software company which enables Private as well as Govt / Defense agencies, and it’s a Pioneer in its domain. It’s even considered as one of the top 12 AI companies in the world. So all I can see is Uphill for PLTR

So this is my personal view, and I know many here have similar opinion on it 😇 I’m not against Shorts, but I’m against their practice of scaremongering the retail investors for their own be if it’s Even when the Company is doing Real Good, that’s against the ethics of stocks investment. If a company is doing good then we want to invest there- and not to doom That company by shorting.

Palantir Metropolis is used by hedge funds, banks, and financial services firms

Palantir Foundry clients include Merck KGaA, Airbus and Ferrari.

Palantir partner Information Warfare Monitor used Palantir software to uncover both the Ghostnet and the Shadow Networks

U.S. civil entities
Palantir's software is used by the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board to detect and investigate fraud and abuse in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Specifically, the Recovery Operations Center (ROC) used Palantir to integrate transactional data with open-source and private data sets that describe the entities receiving stimulus funds. Other clients as of 2019 included Polaris Project, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children,the National Institutes of Health,Team Rubicon,and the United Nations World Food Programme.

In October 2020, Palantir began helping the federal government set up a system that will track the manufacture, distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines across the country.

U.S. military, intelligence, and police	
Palantir Gotham is used by counter-terrorism analysts at offices in the United States Intelligence Community and United States Department of Defense, fraud investigators at the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, and cyber analysts at Information Warfare Monitor (responsible for the GhostNet and the Shadow Network investigation).

Other clients as of 2013 included DHS, NSA, FBI, CDC, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, Special Operations Command, West Point, the Joint IED Defeat Organization and Allies. However, at the time the United States Army continued to use its own data analysis tool.Also, according to TechCrunch, ""The U.S. spy agencies also employed Palantir to connect databases across departments. Before this, most of the databases used by the CIA and FBI were siloed, forcing users to search each database individually. Now everything is linked together using Palantir.""

U.S. military intelligence used the Palantir product to improve their ability to predict locations of improvised explosive devices in its war in Afghanistan. A small number of practitioners reported it to be more useful than the United States Army's program of record, the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS-A). California Congressman Duncan D. Hunter complained of United States Department of Defense obstacles to its wider use in 2012.

Palantir has also been reported to be working with various U.S. police departments, for example accepting a contract in 2013 to help the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center build a controversial license plates database for California. In 2012 New Orleans Police Department partnered with Palantir to create a predictive policing program.

In 2014, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) awarded Palantir a $41 million contract to build and maintain a new intelligence system called Investigative Case Management (ICM) to track personal and criminal records of legal and illegal immigrants. This application has originally been conceived by ICE's office of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), allowing its users access to intelligence platforms maintained by other federal and private law enforcement entities. The system reached its ""final operation capacity"" under the Trump administration in September 2017.[71]

Palantir took over the Pentagon's Project Maven contract in 2019 after Google decided not to continue developing AI unmanned drones used for bombings and intelligence.

International Atomic Energy Agency
Palantir was used by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to verify if Iran was in compliance with the 2015 agreement

Europe	
The firm has contracts relating to patient data from the British National Health Service. It was awarded an emergency, no-competition contract to mine COVID-19 patient data in 2019. In 2020 this was valued at more than £23.5 million and was extended for two more years. The firm was encouraged by Liam Fox “to expand their software business” in Britain.


Partnerships and Contracts::::

International Business Machines	Edit
On February 8, 2021, Palantir and IBM announced a new partnership that would use IBM's hybrid cloud data platform alongside Palantir's operations platform for building applications. The product, Palantir for IBM Cloud Pak for Data, is expected to simplify the process of building and deploying AI-integrated applications with IBM Watson. It will help businesses/users interpret and use large datasets without needing a strong technical background. Palantir for IBM Cloud Pak for Data will be available for general use in March of 2021

Amazon (AWS)	Edit
On March 5, 2021, Palantir announced its partnership with Amazon AWS. Palantir's ERP Suite is now optimized to run on Amazon Web Services. One of the first notable successes of the ERP suite was with BP, which was able to save about $50 million in working capital within two weeks of onboarding the system.

Babylon Health
Palantir took a stake in Babylon Health in June 2021. Ali Parsa told the Financial Times that “nobody” has brought some of the tech that Palantir owns “into the realm of biology and health care.

Palantir Technologies is a public American software company that specializes in big data analytics. Headquartered in Denver, Colorado, it was founded by Peter Thiel, Nathan Gettings, Joe Lonsdale, Stephen Cohen, and Alex Karp in 2003.

Alright, so now let me explain to you why I still have a thing for the homebuilding sector – and more specifically: Green Brick Partners (GRBK). That’s right, these guys are so confident in their business that they named their company GREEN BRICK! They’re feeling themselves and so are the Market Analysts tracking them and their sector.

**TL;DR**

In case you don’t have time to read all of this or look at any of the pictures I included for you, then here’s the long and short of it: the housing market likely won’t letup anytime soon and builders will continue to keep churning out record profits for quarters to come. The safest play is to stay away from calls and look at shares. If you think shares are stupid and are only for boomers, then I suggest looking at ITM calls with a delta ≥.70 for any OPEX after August 2021. Or, in true WSB fashion, go for those near expiry OTM calls like a moth to a flame and see what happens. 

Either way, whatever you choose to do (or don’t, because that’s just as cool) please don’t interpret what I’ve researched and posted here as financial advice.

**i.**  **Overview**

GRBK is a homebuilder and land development company that deals in primarily single-family homes. GRBK does this by working with their subsidiary and affiliate homebuilders in Texas, Colorado, Georgia, and Florida. GRBK subsidiary and affiliate homebuilders are either wholly owned by GRBK or have a majority stake of their business owned by GRBK; GRBK has a pathway to 100% ownership for all subsidiary and affiliate business where they maintain a majority stake in today. Moreover, GRBK has ownership stake in two mortgage lending businesses and one property title business.

GRBK’s CEO and co-founder, Jim Brickman (henceforth referred to as “Big Jim”), plays an important part to my investing thesis and why I’m so bullish on his business. Since I don’t prefer to invest my money in companies ran by chud CEOs - à la Jimmy Chill - I’m happy to report that Big Jim isn’t even close to being a chud. 

GRBK isn’t Big Jim’s first foray into running a homebuilder business. No, in fact Big Jim was part owner of a different Texas homebuilder during the ‘80s. During this period of Big Jim’s career is where he got to experience the joys and pains of leverage. Yes, that same kind of leverage you brain surgeons use when buying deep OTM options on meme stocks with your margin accounts funded by student loans, credit cards, personal loans, etc. As you can imagine Big Jim might’ve also believed things literally couldn’t go tits up. 

Enter the 1984 – 1990 Texas housing depression which caused things to go tits up. Now, to be fair, things went bad for everyone and not just Big Jim during this period in the Texas housing market. I’m not going to go into the details of how Big Jim managed to come through this with his head still attached, but he did.

The key takeaway from all this is Big Jim has experience playing with leverage and getting burned in the process. GRBK as a result of this is one of the lower levered homebuilders in the market. This is also why GRBK resolves to operate their business by keeping their debt-to-capital ratios at no more than 35%. Despite Big Jim’s insistence to grow without the aid of obscene leverage, the business is producing record financial results each year.

**ii.**  **Target Market**

GRBK has successfully diversified their business portfolio to target buyers at all stages of the homeownership cycle. These could be buyers looking for townhomes, luxury homes, and everything in between. GRBK does this by aligning a specific brand to their target market based on price, geography, and type of home. Here’s a snapshot from their recent Q2 2021 investor day presentation deck that outlines this well:



GRBK reported in their Q2 2021 8-K filing that their average home sale price is approximately $438K/unit averaged across all brands. Per their direction advised on their recent earnings call and investor day presentations, GRBK has spent Q1 &amp; Q2 of 2021 focused on their entry-level, detached single family product – Trophy Signature Homes (referred to henceforth as “Trophy”). GRBK has identified that Trophy represents a significant position in how they will look to achieve these tremendous growth figures for years to come, as well as CB JENI, their townhome brand product.

I won’t get into too many of the specifics surrounding the various geographies that GRBK’s brands are based in, but I will narrow into the Dallas Forth Worth (DFW) market. DFW is where Trophy and CB JENI developments are primarily located. As you might be aware, DFW is one of the most active real estate markets in the country. Although Big Jim wouldn’t provide many details surrounding their expansion plans for the Trophy &amp; CB JENI brands outside of the DFW area, he did comment that they are actively looking at the Denver market for these brands to supplement their existing Denver brand product, Challenger Homes. 

I’ve lost too much money with you rocket scientists on surefire investments - such as one ticker that deals in cow shit - I’ll be foregoing the expensive market survey reports from some of the fancy real estate consulting shops and instead will use what is free and accessible – Zonda. The grid below gives a breakout of what Zonda is reporting for a given Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) of where they’re seeing the highest number of housing build starts reported in 2Q 2021. This is great for GRBK since their two biggest growth brands are already established in DFW, which is seeing a 29.9% increase!

&amp;#x200B;



**iii.**  **Land Lots &amp; Supply**

Now, here’s where some of you folks with a wrinkle or two might be thinking to yourself, “hey, housing build starts are great metrics and all, but what happens if they run out of primo land to build on?”. If this was you, congratulations because we’re going to talk about land lots soon and why they are ridiculously important – not just for GRBK, but for all homebuilders. Which now leads me to my next exhibit, which is not a graph at all but a tweet from Zonda’s Chief Economist, Ali Wolf (henceforth referred to as “The Wolf”), who has exemplified great understanding of millennial homebuyers; this is in addition to her already well documented knowledge and experience of residential housing economics (seriously, go check out her credentials). Here’ what The Wolf has recently said concerning the importance of land lots and their subsequent availability:

&amp;#x200B;



The Wolf goes on to share the following graph with us from Zonda’s New Home Land Supply Index (LSI) study. LSI aims to show how specific MSAs are trending regarding available single family vacant lot availability. LSI outputs are adjusted to provide greater weight of figures to vacant lots in MSA subdivisions showing higher building activity. LSI outputs an easy-to-digest scale of measurements based on the following score strata:

·  **125** – Significantly Oversupplied

·  **115 – 125** – Slightly Oversupplied

·  **85 – 115** – Appropriately Supplied

·  **75 – 85** – Slightly Undersupplied

·  **&lt; 75** – Significantly Undersupplied

&amp;#x200B;



Now, just focusing in on Dallas since this is where GRBK has stated is their primary development geography, we can see a reported LSI value of 48.2. Based on the above strata, this means that the Dallas MSA is significantly undersupplied. Here’s why, for me at least, this plays into my bull case for GRBK. GRBK has spent the better part of the last 16 months building up their lot position. Based on GRBK’s recently reported numbers, they’re stating they have either ownership or control of approximately 21,000 lots in their entire book. Their current lot catalog represents a 133% increase over the last 12 months, which is huge. Increase in lot size is a strong indicator for future financial growth. 

Although GRBK doesn’t report out how many of those lots are secured for DFW, we can safely assume that a good bulk of these numbers are allocated for this MSA due to how much of a focus market it is for their growth strategy. GRBK is in a great spot with their lot supply and we can now look to their projections of lot pipeline delivery for the next 6 – 18 months. GRBK plans to be able to deliver to their builders an estimated 1,800 lots within the next 6 months. Moreover, they are projecting they will be able to deliver an estimated 4,600 lots to their builders in 2022.

Next to buyer demand, developed land lots are the single most important thing for builders. GRBK’s superior lot size and strict underwriting model is what they see most attributable to their growth results and will continue to play a role in their future growth. I already mentioned that GRBK has a unique internal control system on their debt-to-capital ratios that they don’t allow to exceed 35%; they’re currently below this threshold although not by much. Additionally, GRBK has a strict underwriting model that they adhere to which targets meeting a 20% un-levered return and exceeding 20% gross margins on transactions. GRBK’s operating model also aims for them to maintain these numbers without having to rely solely on passing the expense onto customers. This is a great segue into GRBK’s Operating System.

**iv.**  **Operating System**

It’s not uncommon for large homebuilders to have multiple different affiliate builder and subsidiaries that operate underneath them and GRBK is no different. Out of all of the subsidiary and affiliate builders that GRBK either wholly owns or maintains a majority ownership stake, they all utilize GRBK’s Operating System (OS). GRBK’s OS is focused on the following:

1.  Accounting

2.  Construction

3.  Purchasing

4.  Production Platform

So, what does this all mean? This OS is how GRBK handles and runs their entire business in an efficient and scalable way. GRBK’s builders are provided with an IT platform that allows them to easily track and manage their production pipelines from end-to-end. This in turn allows GRBK to collect and analyze real-time business analytics to identify any worrying gaps or trends within the various segments of their business.

For those unfamiliar with Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses (SG&amp;A), it’s an important metric for any business. SG&amp;A though becomes more important for businesses that deal in actual physical goods when compared to other businesses. The reason for this is that margin can be more easily affected by external forces. Companies that lower their SG&amp;A can generally expect to see a positive impact to their profit margins as a result. GRBK’s OS allows them to monitor their business channels tightly and efficiently to ensure that they are truly reducing SG&amp;A wherever possible. GRBK has successfully reduced their SG&amp;A YoY and is currently reporting an SG&amp;A of 9.1%, or $45K/unit. GRBK projects that they will be able to continue reducing their SG&amp;A and therefore add additional room for higher profit margins per unit. 

GRBK has a solid OS which provides me with added confidence that they are managing all ends of their business responsibly and effectively. Additionally, it tells me that should GRBK look to acquire future builders into their portfolio this OS should help them integrate M&amp;A targets more easily and quickly. Lastly, I like their OS because it allows them to actively track and monitor their internal debt-to-capital ratios by providing access to real-time business financial performance. 

**v.**  **Financials**

We’ll cover some of the financial performance figures of GRBK in this section. Fair warning, there may be some things in these financial statements that you’re unfamiliar with, such as an astounding lack of parentheses around numbers, and that’s okay – we’re going to talk about it. GRBK has a profitable business and a balance sheet to support this. Let’s look at their recent Q2 2021 filing:

&amp;#x200B;



To me, this statement is nothing but beautiful. Out of the many great figures reported, their revenue and Earnings Per Share (EPS) are what jump out at me. When comparing this quarter’s results to Q2 of 2020, you can see that they increased their total reported revenues by more than 62%. Additionally, they saw their EPS grow by more than 53% when compared to the same period. Outstanding all around and absolutely above board what The Street projected.

In terms of where these revenues are being derived from, GRBK reports that they maintain four prominent revenue streams for their business (in no particular order): homebuilding, mortgage, title, and residential management service operation. I believe it’s safe to assume based on their financial statement that homebuilding represents their single largest revenue channel of their entire business. In the next section we’ll touch on how they’re poised to continue this growth by focusing their efforts on their Trophy &amp; CB JENI product brands. 

In summary, nothing personally jumps out to me as being bad or worrisome about their financial statement. I will say both here and in the bear case section, that this level of growth is enormous and should certainly be viewed as a positive but could also prove to trap GRBK to meeting continuously loftier financial results YoY. One thing I will note is that later in their 8-K filing it is shown that GRBK has 100MM shares authorized of their common stock versus a float of roughly half that at 50.7MM.

**vi.**  **Growth Focus**

GRBK has stated that they’re looking to possibly expand into other MSAs but have not publicly identified which MSAs they’re currently eyeing except for Denver. It’s important to note that GRBK already has a presence in Denver with their Challenger Homes brand; I speculate this statement to mean that they will consider moving other brand offerings into this MSA with a focus on entry level home buyers via their Trophy &amp; CB JENI brands. GRBK reported that their average unit home sale price was approximately $438K in Q2 2021. 

Trophy &amp; CB JENI are already established brands in DFW. As noted earlier, we know that GRBK increased their lot size by over 133% in the past 12 months. Taking into consideration their strong lot size position and Zonda’s reporting that the DFW MSA is significantly undersupplied for available developed lots is key when contrasting the reported number of new home build starts for this same MSA. My interpretation of this is that GRBK expects to see tremendous, continued growth for the balance of 2021 and into 2022 based on how they have appropriated their lot sizing and development pipeline. I find additional confidence in my thesis knowing that a large portion of GRBK’s lot positions will be allocated to support the Trophy &amp; CB JENI brands that cater to the entry level buyer group with an average purchase price below GRBK’s reported $438K average unit sale price. 

Looking back to GRBK’s investor day presentation, it was reported that their Trophy brand of homes represented their largest portion of sales YTD. This is great news especially when considering that Trophy is one of GRBK’s highest margin brands. Let’s look at the following exhibit which supports this position:

&amp;#x200B;



Per the above, you can see that the majority of GRBK’s lot position is indeed allocated to support the Trophy brand in the DFW area. Moreover, when comparing their YTD units started being lower than their other brands but showing a higher allocation of total lots controlled for the same period makes me believe that they’re truly focusing in on driving growth at the entry level buyer segment and have big plans for the remainder of 2021. Unfortunately, GRBK didn’t provide as much information regarding their plans for the CB JENI brand outside of comments made by GRBK’s leadership team, and the President of CB JENI, that they would indeed be focusing on this brand as well. Lastly, look at the financial growth results produced by Trophy:

&amp;#x200B;



The key takeaway here is how GRBK has managed to so efficiently manage their Trophy brands product to secure such incredible results on its financial growth. Lowered SG&amp;A will lead to higher margins and GRBK has already stated that their OS is how they hope to continue improving upon lowering their SG&amp;A. Another interesting thing to comment on about Trophy is how GRBK has led with some market innovation by using pre-manufactured roofing trusses and pre-built wall panels. These strategies have allowed the Trophy brands to better control construction materials costs and decrease their skilled labor needs. Lastly, they’re able to increase their build cycle timelines by having these pre-manufactured and pre-built materials included as part of their home construction.

Overall, I think GRBK has a great strategy in place for their Trophy &amp; CB JENI brands and will ultimately continue to see popularity amongst entry level homebuyers. One thing I will note is that we cannot turn a blind eye to the global supply chain disruptions that are plaguing the market end-to-end and as a result of GRBK using pre-manufactured and pre-built construction materials in their homes could open them to susceptible project overages if they must pivot to more conventional methods during the construction process; this would most likely create a negative impact to their brand SG&amp;A and profit margins.

**vii.**  **Competition**

Make no mistake, there is plenty of competition in this sector. When comparing GRBK to their competition you will find that they’re generally a smaller player in this sector in terms of market cap. For comparison, Lennar (LEN) maintains a market cap of \~$33.5BN vs. GRBK’s market cap of $1.35BN. However, of all the competitors there really are only two that have a similar market cap, float, and P/E to GRBK. Those competitors are Tri Point Homes (TPH) and Taylor Morrison (TMHC). Other tickers for this sector include: KBH, NVR, MHO, CCS, MDC, DHI, PHM, and LGIH.

I have not spent nearly as much time researching GRBK’s competitors, however a review of their overall performance seems to show that the sector in general is doing very well. I think there are some other sympathetic trading plays here to be made that apply to GRBK’s competition, too. If you’re interested in GRBK I think it would be worth the time to investigate some of these other tickers for investment consideration, too. Lastly, I’ll comment that you should look at XHB, which is the S&amp;P homebuilder ETF.

**viii.**  **Bear Case**

The primary concern that I have for not just GRBK alone, but this sector, is maintain buyer demand. Without buyer demand high there is little opportunity for GRBK to continue posting these record profits. Personally, I got interested in this space after having gone through the process of trying to buy a home myself and subsequently being priced out of where I hoped to buy. My response to this was to simply to just “wait and see” how the market responds. I’ll admit that I’m beginning to think my decision was a mistake based on what I’ve researched.

Another consideration to make is existing unit backlogs. GRBK reported a backlog of 1,876 at an average unit price of $519K for Q2 2021. By GRBK’s own admission, they are closely monitoring their backlog inventories but are not yet concerned of driving down these supply figures. There are two concerns here I recognize: if buyer demand drops off the backlog and spec home units will pile up and create a negative impact to GRBK’s bottom life and capital efficiencies. I will be closely watching GRBK’s backlog numbers reported for Q3 2021. 

Mortgage rates right now are at historic lows but are starting to creep up ever so slightly. Low interest rates can offset some of the financial cost associated with purchasing a more expensive home – you’re robbing Peter (mortgage company) with a lower interest rate, to pay Paul (GRBK, other builders) for their higher priced products. The concern here is that if cost does not equally level out when interest rates eventually increase, then you can no longer expect to be able to rob Peter to pay Paul, which would effectively price more people out of the market. Again, it’s going to be critical to see what happens with the Trophy &amp; CB JENI brand lines of GRBK since they’ll be focusing on the cheaper entry level buyer space.

Lot availability is a concern. I’ve already pointed out how The Wolf has stated that homebuilder success is directly attributable to their lot positions. If GRBK is not able to continue to manage their lot pipeline to pace accordingly with their building timelines and schedules for the upcoming years, then they will face problems with meeting their high growth projections. Watching the overall progression of available lots for the MSAs that GRBK operates in, and their subsequent lot acquisition pricing will be huge to gauge whether they can keep up this performance.

I’m sure there are other bear cases to be made, however this is what I’ve come up with now. Please feel free to add and comment with your own takes and considerations. Overall, I feel as though the bull cases still outweigh the bear cases to be made for this ticker.

**iv.**  **Technical Analysis**

For those of you who place a considerable amount of weight to TA, then you can thank u/Fox_Technicals for reviewing this. I’m going to do my best to interpret what I see, however I’ll let u/Fox_Technicals chime in with any additional comments or observations they would like to make in the form of edits and updates to the post. We’ll start looking at the following:

&amp;#x200B;



This chart is looking to show us that GRBK may be on its way towards a breakout from the 2X.XX something share price it’s been trading at for so long. I’d also comment here that following their recent Q2 2021 earnings that most Analysts are maintaining price targets that range from the low to mid 30s; one such example is B. Riley raised their original PT of $35/share to $37/share on 8/05/21. This also shows that the lower trend could target somewhere in the 24s. Also, it’s important to note the comparison to XHB and that GRBK’s RSI is improving against XHB. Earlier I mentioned LEN as a competitor to GRBK, so let’s look at LEN:

&amp;#x200B;



Looking at this chart, u/Fox_Technicals is showing that LEN also appears to be on a breakout trend upwards. Now, admittedly I’m not as familiar with LEN’s business as I am with GRBK but based on what little review I’ve done they also seem to be doing extremely well as far as financial results are concerned. I’ll let u/Fox_Technicals provide any additional commentary on this ticker that they’ve identified. Next, we’ll look at XHB:

&amp;#x200B;



Looking back to the initial chart of GRBK, and then comparing it to XHB, you’ll recall that GRBK’s RSI was increasing against homebuilders (XHB). Well, when you look at this chart and compare XHB against SPY you can see there are higher highs being made against SPY. This action could signal that we’re looking at a potential breakout for leading the market

**x.**  **Strategy**

As mentioned in the initial, TL;DR, I think the primary play here is with shares. However, there is a way to play this with options as well, but we need to be clear on the risks as such. Fortunately, this section should be brief in contrast to the rest of this submission, but there really isn’t much strategy surrounding what I think is best or “safest” with respect to this stock and that’s holding shares. Truly, just buy shares and hold and I think you will see a great return especially around their Q3 2021 earnings call. 

Now, about options there is a way to play this if you’re okay with the risk. Couple of things you need to know is that overall GRBK doesn’t have much volume in their average daily shares traded. Currently their three-month average daily volume is only 433K shares/day against a float of approximately 50.77MM shares. Additionally, you must recognize that GRBK’s options are extremely illiquid. The bid/ask spreads are tremendously wide, and you will run the risk of getting hammered on bad fills (or plainly just not getting filled at all). 

That’s not a lot of daily movement and as a result the IV for their option chain is low – only currently showing \~48%. So, if you’re interested, you could look at picking up OTM calls for September &amp; November expiries to try and possibly benefit from increased performance in this sector over the coming weeks/months and make your gains from any increases in IV accordingly. Personally, I do not think this is a good idea and is well outside of my risk profile but I’m sure for some of you this is right what you’re looking for. 

Now, the safer options play would be to target ITM options with a delta value of ≥.70 for expiries beginning in September at the earliest. If you can afford these calls, you would be able to (more or less) establish for yourself a synthetic long position without needing to hold shares. The caveat to this is that you’re going to benefit less from things such as IV expansion as the delta values of your calls become closer to a value of 1.0. The strategy here is to ride the calls for as long as you probably would if you were instead holding shares. Again, I still think shares are the better play, but you do what’s best for you.

**xi.**  **Conclusion &amp; Disclaimer**

I am not a financial advisor. I have made tremendously questionable investment decisions during my short time spent here on WSB. As a result, please do your own research. Please review what I’ve written and check into it for yourself. Essentially do not blindly take my word for anything and instead do a bit of legwork and figure out if you think you see the value in this ticker (hell, or even sector) like I do. These statements and writings are nothing more than my opinion and should not be interpreted as professional and legitimate financial or investment advice.

That now being out the way, I do believe in GRBK’s growth strategy and overall business model. I think that GRBK is an affordable, value play in this sector that will only look to see increased coverage in months to come. I also think that GRBK is uniquely positioned above their competition to be successful in how they manage their affiliate and subsidiary builders. Also, I’m quite pleased to see how GRBK was head of the curve in their decision to accumulate immense lot ownership to fuel their continued growth objectives. Lastly, GRBK’s CEO and co-founder, Big Jim, has a great approach to manage debt-to-capital in a way that has successfully proven that you don’t need to lever yourself to the tits to secure great profit results.

Currently I only maintain active positions in GRBK. My positions are solely in call options. Let me explain why that is. I’ve currently been holding 2x 8/20 25c since this past April to speculate on this stock before entering a long position. My intent was to see the share price rise to \~$27 sometime in June and then at that point make the decision to either cut away and STC my calls or exercise. I never hit my PT and therefore will most likely look to roll my calls to November OPEX or flat out exercise next Friday. I also picked up some lottery tickets this week when the rally began on Monday at 3x $30 strike – these calls are not doing great as you can imagine for all the reasons I mentioned above. Lastly, I have a single call for September OPEX at the $30 strike. Here is a snapshot of my positions:

**Production:**

The company in their earnings call said they are on track to start production at the end of Sep 2021. If you actually listened to what they said, they said this is for test-builds that they hope to validate in Q4 and to deliver a few to some special early customers in Q1' 2022. They further said or implied that they expect regular commercial deliveries to start in Q2' 2022. Previously, they said on the Q1' 2021 call they had enough cash to ramp production to produce and deliver 1,000 vehicles this year. Now delivery (ignoring their special test-builds delivered to early customers) is pushed back to Q2' 2022. Maybe the word PRODUCTION is being misused to imply something other than what they are doing. I would suggest the correct term for what they are doing now is PRE-PRODUCTION. In any case this is semantics as revenue requires deliveries, not production.

**Equity Line of Credit (ELOC):**

There have been claims that there is a ""Line of Credit"" providing up to $400M in financing in place. In fact this is a complete misrepresentation. Below is the link to an SEC filing describing the agreement between RIDE and YA. Here are some key points and how the $400M is computed and why it does not mean anything.

On 7/23/2021 they entered into the agreement with YA to purchase up to $400M of their Class A Common Stock over a 36 month period at RIDE's discretion (that should be a red flag there. As why would YA agree to this... well all will be explained). Per that filing, "" The net proceeds that we may receive under the Purchase Agreement cannot be determined at this time..."", which means that while RIDE can potentially receive up to $400M, they might receive far less but can't predict that amount, as it depends on the stock price.

The agreement says that RIDE can only sell YA, up to 35,144,690 in shares, UNLESS, (1) they obtain shareholder approval to sell more or (2) the average price they sell the shares to YA at is over $7.48 per share. The price of the shares is 3% less than the ""simple average of the daily VWAP's for the three trading days following notice to YA"" There are also daily limits on how many shares RIDE can sell to YA at any time.

So assuming 35M shares, at a current share price of about $5.8 that is about $204M before the 3% discount to market price that RIDE nets. For RIDE to net 400M, with selling 35M shares they need a share price of $11.4. Alternatively they need shareholders to approve selling much more than 35M shares (so just more dilution) or they need the average price to be over $7.48, which will allow them to increase the shares they sell, so also more dilution.

In sum, at current market prices they net about $200M under this ""Equity Line of Credit"" or share offering. However, as selling shares will likely depress the price, they should net far less.

[

**Further Dilution:**

Per the SEC filing below, it says that Mr. Burns can sell 50% of his shares by 10/23/2021. Steve Burns owns 46.4 million shares, so assuming he sells when his shares are unlocked he can sell 23.2M shares end of Oct 2021. While in theory not ""dilutive"" the end of lock-ups tend to have a similar impact by flooding the market with more shares than demand for them.

[

**Cash Position:**

Per their Q2 earnings call and reports they have about 366M in cash on hand at 6/30/2021. In their earnings report they suggested about 200M in operating expenses for the rest of 2021 and about 215M in CAPEX. While they suggested they can time some of the payments in Q3, this comes to about 415M in cash needed to get through the year. That is about 50M cash short.

Going back to their ELOC, at current share price they can raise about 200M, so assuming they raise the funds without dropping the share price that leaves them  with 150M at year end. It is reasonable to assume that their quarterly cash needs will only increase as they attempt to get to production (this has been the case so far for them and has been the case by every other auto maker as far as I can tell) means that for Q1' 2022 they will need over 200M.  The conclusion is obvious, that on top of the current share offering, if the share price does not go up, they must issue more shares. Further, they project regular commercial deliveries in Q2' 2022 so the money they need will not be insignificant.

**Other Sources of Funds:**

The Company suggested that they are getting a valuation on their plant and equipment in order to possibly borrow funds against that. They suggested that the value is much more than the book value of about $300M. The fact is, a lot of their equipment will be installed and modified to their specs and will not be suitable without additional cost to another manufacturer. This means that fire sale value, or what someone might actually lend against it, will likely be far less than the book value. Perhaps to Lordstown, the value is higher, but to a third party that is a very doubtful assumption. As to the factory itself, it was an old plant that GM shut down. This is not something people are looking to buy. For EV's, you see with Tesla, Lucid, and others they are looking or building new factories with layouts designed for EV's and not ICE vehicles. I would again doubt the factory has much value for a lender. Hard to know what they can borrow using their plant and equipment as collateral, but it clearly will not be much.

**Conclusion:**

Given the dilution and share unlocks coming and their downward pressure on share price, as it stands now the company will have difficult raising sufficient funds to get to production. For the company to be viable, it must have its share price go up first to enable them to raise funds favorably. As evidenced by today's price action, this company is not attracting substantial shareholder inflows, so it remains unclear how the share price increases first to enable them to raise sufficient funds. So based on the current share price, I don't understand how this company, even if they do everything right going forward, can succeed.

**Some Other Thoughts:**

None of the above analysis is dependent on whether the in-wheel tech works or not or is a good candidate for a commercially viable electric truck. I have for several months expressed substantial doubts about the tech and RIDE's ability to execute and have no reason to assume otherwise. In any case, even if it could work, structurally RIDE is not in a position anymore to commercialize it.

I actually also have an issue with Price Targets analysts are setting here. Either you have to have a high price target or a near-zero one. An in-between target makes no sense as current share price means they are headed to insolvency before they can produce anything. This company is either a $10+ investment or a &lt;$1 investment, there is no in-between.

**TL,DR price-target &lt;$1 and bankruptcy in Q4' 2021 or Q1' 2022 (if they are lucky they push it off till Q2' 2022).**

It’s the in-flight internet service that your wife's boyfriend pays for so you can check your robinhood account while he’s in the mile-high club.  

Gogo is the world's largest provider of broadband connectivity services for the business aviation market. They offer a customizable suite of smart cabin systems for highly integrated connectivity, inflight entertainment and voice solutions. Gogo's products and services are installed on thousands of business aircraft of all sizes and mission types from turboprops to the largest global jets, and are utilized by the largest fractional ownership operators, charter operators, corporate flight departments and individuals.

Currently, there are 2,000 business aircraft flying with Gogo's AVANCE L5 or L3 system installed. As of March 31, 2021, Gogo reported 5,892 aircraft flying with its ATG systems onboard, and 4,614 aircraft with satellite connectivity installed.

That's over 10,000 aircrafts with their technology!

*“Health and safety is one of the top reasons that explains the shift from commercial to private travel. According to Vista, the number of touchpoints significantly decreases when flying private, from 700 when flying commercial to 20 interactions with private travel. VistaJet expects the increased number of first-time private flyers to keep growing in 2021 and beyond as travelers continue to look for more safe and reliable flight solutions.”* \- **via Luxury Travel Advisors.** 

Currently we’re sitting at 32.31% SI *(ORTEX DATA)* however, a few other places are showing slightly higher percentages. Now, according to ORTEX there’s about 14.79 million shares that were reported short on Aug 10th. It’s important to note that the 14.79 million shares short were settled on Jul 30th.

A Golden Cross is a basic technical indicator that occurs in the market when a short-term moving average (50-day) of an asset rises above a long-term moving average (200-day). When traders see a Golden Cross occur, they view this chart pattern as indicative of a strong bull market.

Many investors view the Golden Cross as a “holy grail” chart pattern. They consider it one of the most definitive signals of a bull market and, therefore, a strong buy signal. However, there are also analysts who question the validity of the Cross pattern. They do so because of the limited research to detail and prove its legitimacy as a trading mechanism. The most recent evaluation opportunity is in favor of the Golden Cross. Since the pattern last occurred in the S&amp;P 500 Index, the index has gone up by more than 50%

Together, let's hyperfocus on Matterport. This following DD is my PhD thesis that I've compiled on this stock. If you don't know about Matterport, start off with my [introductory post here]( Also, check out some other bullish sentiment [here](

TLDR: Matterport is a software company that enables individuals and enterprise clients to efficiently create digital 3D models of physical locations.

\[The bot isn't letting me post certain links. Gotta remove em\] 

## Let’s Begin With an Analogy:

Amazon started selling books with a *vision* to expand into many products. Matterport is doing something similar. They’re targeting some specific industries such as real estate and a few others. However, the *vision* goes far beyond this.

## Indexing of 3D models:

Matterport’s CEO RJ Pittman (formerly at Google, Apple &amp; eBay) [spoke in 2008]( about Google’s plan to index the world’s images. This is the essence of what Matterport is going to do with 3D models. **They’re actively indexing the world’s fastest-growing database of 3D models.** This process will be automated and powered by AI.

Why does this MTTR?

## The Apex

Let’s talk about APEX Imaging Services \[Link blocked by Bot, just google it\]. Apex is [utilizing Matterport’s]( products to bring 3D building information and visualization to storefronts.

**APEX serves multiple companies such as:**

* **Starbucks**
* **Home Depot**
* **Chipotle**
* **7 Eleven**
* **CVS**
* and even **Chick Filet**

These 3D models enable retailers to take measurements of the store without sending somebody out to do it in person.

Most importantly, the features of these stores are *MASS-SEARCHABLE* because of indexing. With indexed 3D buildings, you can search for every Starbucks that has a 5 sq foot bathroom. Instantly see specific features in stores. Corporate can click a few buttons and get whatever data they need.

**Indexing Applications for Real Estate:** These searchable features carry over to real estate. Want to find an apartment with large closets? Just click a few buttons. I don't actually have any idea if this applies in real estate I just figure that it will.

I mean, after all, newer generations value integrity and honesty in real estate listings. 3D tours enable users to experience a more transparent and honest representation of the space they’re looking into. Many agree that [pictures in real-estate are becoming misleading](

Not to mention, being able to measure space to see if that couch will fit. It's a real value prop.

## The potential of searchable, indexed, 3D buildings is huge.

Just look at their partnership with Facebook AI. (Search ""Habitat AI Facebook"") 

That’s right. They’re [training AI on 3D datasets]( Matterport’s ever-expanding database of 3D buildings will fuel AI researchers in the coming years. Not to mention the datasets can be used for training robots in simulation.

This means Matterport could inadvertently accelerate our ascent towards an AI apocalypse. How could you not be bullish?

## Explosive Android Market Potential:

Android Capture is Matterport’s upcoming app which will enable a huge amount of onboarding onto Matterport’s subscription platform. Much of their growth can be attributed to their recent iPhone app, but that's only 20% of smartphone owners.

80% of smartphone owners own an Android device.  Matterport’s stock will pop when they release Android capture. I’m unsure about the specifics of how that'll work, whether it uses traditional photogrammetry, or will be supplemented with user-owned lidar attachments for Android.

## The Team:

&gt;A goal without a plan, is just a wish. And they’ve got a plan.

New hires are coming in from Slice, Grubhub, and other startup companies. Their reliable and quickly growing team is the sole reason they’ll accomplish their plan.

## In-conclusion

Thanks for momentarily skimming through this post that I spent the past hour writing. I’ll continue to post fresh and relevant updates on Matterport as more news comes around.

I am going to college for aerospace and have hours and hours and hours of obsession and background knowledge from being a fan of the industry since childhood. 

Astra just signed another new contract, this time with a private small sat company Spire to launch in 2022. This is in addition to the Space Force contract and broader Department of Defense contract recently secured earlier this week. Both contracts are multiple launches over the next decade.

I can’t exaggerate how important and massive US governmental contracts are to a young rocket company. While some space launch providers take years and dozens of attempts to prove reliability of their vehicles, the government contracting Astra as one of three companies chosen for Space Forces Orbital Services Program (OSP 4) legitimizes the company and its technology globally. Astra is meant to be a scalable company that sells rockets in the normal small satellite market but also to other governmental space agencies around the world. Of 90 countries with space agencies only less then 30 can actually reliably reach space. However, Astra’s focus on scalable production and rockets that fit entirely within a standard sized shipping container means that these rockets can safely and easily be shipped anywhere in the world to launch, and can do so at a cost basis many multiples lower then whatnot would cost to fully design and produce a rocket yourself. 

SHORT TERM PRICE POTENTIAL:

Astra will be publishing their earnings today for the first time after hours. I’ll be honest I don’t care and don’t know what to expect but I do think that it is possible that we see some massive price action given the string of new contracts and commitments that have come out just this week. It will also lend clarity to future expectations and ambitions that can be a major producer of hype. 

Astra will also be attempting to enter orbit for the first time very soon on August 27th. They have been to space but orbit is higher then that and they fell just slightly short when they planned to only just hit orbit on their last launch. This will be their first orbital flight and their first ever commercial flight, not to mention their first attempt as a public company. They have many great former NASA engineers who have put in the work and I have no doubt they will succeed. The government is marred in bureaucracy and risk isn’t very common, the DOD and Space Force would not sign contracts if the company didn’t have their shit together. This is a competitive market, those wins mean a LOT.

I have no idea how it’s so undervalued, it shouldn’t be. It’s worth 2.78 Billion but space TOURISM companies like Virgin Galactic is worth like 10 B. The market for scalable reliable well engineered and mass producible rockets is a proven market, as compared to space tourism which has had two successful spaceflights, both for show, ever (Bezos and Branson). It could easily 3X and still be undervalued, with no real catalysts because it’s simply underpriced.

I also posted DD about Rocket Lab but they are doing a SPAC thing so I won’t talk about that here. (I love that stock).

Y’all the pieces are their, Astra is undervalued because from a boomer POV, it’s some crazy Rocket people who just recently went public via SPAC, but in reality it’s an absurdly undervalued play that seems risky on the surface but is increasingly legitimate. Look at the coverage it gets from the space nerd community, it’s a lot of high praise and talk about what they do, which is fairly unique as there are a ton of space launch providers who get no coverage as they aren’t interesting or they aren’t affecting the realm of space enough to warrant a mention. This is not the case with Astra.

I have a bunch of options expiring Sept 17th as well as 109 shares, between being undervalued, the upcoming orbital launch, and attention being brought to the industry by Rocket Lab going public into the 20th, there’s likely to be some significant upside in the short term.

TL:DR; Astra might have a massive 2-5x move that could be a well justified and conservative estimate for the near term. Many crayons were eaten and I am in 100% on this company and the industry.

Catalysts:

1. Due to a rule change on iOS WeedMaps is **finally allowed to roll out in-App purchases** of products rather than only previewing what different dispensaries have in stock. This change happened this week! I believe this will significantly improve the stickiness of WM as a marijuana saas offering.

6. Any positive moves in **deregulation will continue to increase their TAM**

One concern, as is the case with many SPACs, is around new issuance and warrants. I believe the reason the share prices have remained capped largely because of concern over the company authorizing the sale of additional shares. I think they have **sufficient cash on hand and especially after the SPAC closed that they won't need to issue additional equity.**

I think the current risk/reward presents a significant asymmetric opportunity to the upside and I think more people will come to realize that $MAPS has a great business that allows for growing exposure to the marijuana industry without heavy exposure to one supplier/brand. **$MAPS rises with the tide, no matter whose ship is the fastest.**

Clover Health (NASDAQ:CLOV) is under r/WallStreetBets’ spotlight again after printing second-quarter earnings. The Medicare advantage provider reported a whopping $412 million in revenue, more than double the consensus estimate of $205.4 million.

Clover was soaring 20% toward the $10 mark early Thursday morning. Although Clover respectably printed a blowout quarter, and the share price could go much higher due to that, the stock also has bizarre characteristics that have helped to make it a short squeeze candidate in the past.

Between June 7 to July 9 Clover Health soared about 205% from $9.35 to an all-time high of $28.85. Like GameStop Corporation (NYSE:GME) back in January, Clover’s underlying statistics appeal to retail traders looking to squeeze short sellers:

Small Float: Clover has a relatively small float of just 112.38 million shares.
Ownership Levels: Clover has an unbelievable 119.64% of its float tied up in the hands of insiders and institutions with 95.06% of its shares held by institutions and 24.58% by insiders.
Short Interest: 25.26 million shares, meaning 22.47% of its total float, is held short although this number has dropped from 35.89 million in June.
See Also: How to Buy Clover Health Stock

The Clover Health Chart: After Clover’s parabolic run in June the stock sold off over 72% and found a bottom at the $7.84 mark. For the past 20 trading days, Clover has held above the level and traded in a tight sideways pattern under $8.99.

There has been low volume in Clover’s stock during the sideways trading, indicating a lack of both sellers and buyers. Often when a security’s volume drops off for an extended period of time, either huge bearish or bullish volume comes in to break it from the sideways pattern.

Clover closed Wednesday just below the eight-day and 21-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) with the eight-day EMA trending below the 21-day, which is bearish. If Clover trades above the $8.70 area on Thursday it will be above both commonly followed EMAs and the short-term sentiment will be bullish.

The 200-day simple moving average (SMA), which is a tool used to measure overall sentiment in a stock, is at about the $10.50 area. If Clover trades below the SMA, overall sentiment is bearish; if the stock is able to clear the level, the sentiment will shift to bullish.”

Just the day before yesterday, Pfizer shares hit an all-time high of $48,57, even breaking its record high of 1999.  

Not only this, the stock price of BioNTech SE (NASDAQ: BNTX) on August 9 gained 14.97% from a previous close of $389.01 to $447.23. Perhaps, the charm of BioNTech started to wane in subsequent days with closing at losses of almost 7% and 14% intraday. 

Well…these were a matter of two days, and it will be too premature to analyze the trend reversal. So far, since Mid-July, BioNTech shares have been rallying high. To give you some context, these two days of intraday loss made BioNTech and Moderna forego a combined $60 billion market value. And, what was the reason? Investors were hesitant to accept their lofty valuation! What’s wrong with everyone?! Covid has still not gone…! Companies have time to cash in some sales. 

BioNTech posted earnings of $12.67 per share for the second quarter. And, their sales were $6.2 billion, beating analyst expectations. Anyway….as per the news media, demand for the covid-19 vaccine will continue till 2022 and beyond. It simply signifies pharma companies’ sales are facing no threat in near future. 

Investors should also see that, as of late July, BioNTech along with Pfizer has shipped around a billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccines. Moreover, these pharma firms have also signed orders for delivering more than 2.2 billion doses this year. 

The estimates for these 2.2 m billion doses can be easily concluded at €15.9 billion. The catch is, these pharma firms will be manufacturing 4 billion doses by next year. Jeez! Why won’t their stocks soar high!

Things don't end here. In a presentation yesterday, BioNTech revealed that their vaccine is effective against all the current variants including the Delta variant. Additionally, soon, BioNTech will take the approval of booster shots. When demand is there, then why would the company not raise revenue guidance?",What’s In Store For BioNTech ($BNTX) Shares?,3,7

Introduction

The BLS [Consumer Price Index]( (CPI) has become one of the most anticipated data points each month. The CPI has become a controversial measure over the years. Many correctly point out that it is continuously refined to lower the inflation readings using mechanisms like Owners Equivalent Rent and goods substitution. This makes sense from a strategic standpoint as inflation expectations have shown that they can cause inflation to increase. Thus understating inflation can rein in expectations.

Even though the inflation methodology is controversial, this analysis uses the data within the CPI (indexes and weightings) to recalculate the inflation rate from a sub-category level. This allows better insight into what is driving the price changes as the charts below show. For more detail on inflation based on the way it used to be calculated before the modifications, see Shadow Stats.

*Note: Inflation by definition is the expansion of the money supply but for this article it will refer to rising prices.*

**Recent Trends**

The latest seasonally adjusted month over month inflation rate was .47%, with non-seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.37%. The biggest reason for the fall from June’s .91% pace was a significant drop in Commodities and Transportation.

Specifically, Commodities fell due to a collapse in used car increases from 10.5% in June to 0.2% in July. The fall in Transportation was driven by a few month over month factors: Car Rentals from 5.2% to -4.6%, Insurance from 1.2% to -2.8%, and Airline Fares from 2.7% to -0.1%. So, does this prove that inflation was “transitory”? Most likely not, as shown below.

&amp;#x200B;



 

The year over year chart below does highlight the dramatic impact of Commodities (Used Cars) and Energy. It is unlikely that used cars will continue moving up and may even revert lower as more supply comes on the market. However, it is also unlikely that Oil will reverse and may actually continue to increases in the months ahead.

Furthermore, as eviction moratoriums inevitably end, rents are going to push higher to compensate landlords for lost rent. Finally, there are major supply issues and port constraints that will not alleviate in the near future, it is likely that the high costs will be passed to consumers in the months ahead.

&amp;#x200B;



 

The plot below compares the recent numbers with the year over year monthly average. This chart further highlights that many items are still *increasing* in price. The blue bar shows the most recent period and the orange bar is the 12 month average. In almost all categories, the blue bar is higher except for the items mentioned above (commodities, specifically used cars, and transportation).

&amp;#x200B;



 

The table below gives a more detailed breakdown of the numbers. It shows the actual figures reported by the BLS side by side with the recalculated and unrounded numbers. The weighted column shows the contribution each value makes to the aggregated number. Some key takeaways:

* Shelter doubled MoM from .2 to .43. YoY the jump was 2.34 to 2.79.  

   * This is where Owners Equivalent rent is a farce. Many articles have been written showing rents are rising much faster. Eventually the surveys will pick up on this because obviously the housing market is rising way faster than 2.79% YoY.
* Food is up MoM from -.3 to +.72. Food does tend to be volatile, so hard to know if these prices will remain.  

   * YoY food has actually fallen from 4.07% down to 3.44%
* The big MoM drop in transportation can be seen from +2.76% to -1.09%  

   * Again, this could be due to slowing demand as a result of the Delta variant. YoY the base effect is still having an impact showing Transport up 6.22% vs -3.79%.
* Finally, even though everyone is already claiming this latest report shows June was the peak, a look at the MoM diff tells a different story. Almost half the categories are still *increasing* in price. It’s very possible this is the start of the earlier price increases making their way into the broader economy.

&amp;#x200B;



 

VALIDATING THE RECALCULATION

Recalculating the BLS number is not a perfect science. The weightings must be scraped from the web pages. The index data is then gathered using an API. Each index comes seasonally adjusted and unadjusted. To validate the recalculation there are three variables shown below:

* The Actual Reported number
* A number calculated using the All Items index that is Unrounded
* A number recalculated using the sub-category levels and doing a weighted average sum

The chart below shows the recalculation is very accurate compared to the reported numbers.

&amp;#x200B;



 

Historical Perspective

The BLS weightings have only been scraped back to 2012, thus the chart below shows the past 9 years of annual inflation data. The volatility in Energy can be seen clearly over this time period. The base effect in transportation (purple) can also be seen with the decreases in 2020 followed by the increases in 2021. Finally, the impact of used cars on commodities (light blue) can also be seen clearly in the more recent period.

&amp;#x200B;



 The historical weightings show that there is not much change overtime across categories. It also shows the massive weighting given to Shelter which is why Owners Equivalent Rent has had such a strong impact on anchoring reported inflation. 

&amp;#x200B;



 

**What is the Fed looking at?**

Finally the Fed publishes data going back to the 1950s. Unfortunately they do not publish the weightings of each category so it would be impossible to do a similar analysis showing the impact of each category on the overall number. The Fed categories are slightly different because they do not separate energy into it’s own category. Regardless, the top line number at the Fed matches the BLS CPI as expected.

Looking at history back to 1950 puts the current spike into perspective. The last time the economy saw a spike similar to the current one was in 2008. Inflation was tempered then by the Global Financial Crisis. What is going to stop the explosion in prices this time? Especially with the Fed continuing to [grow it’s balance sheet]( and [expand the money supply]( each month.

&amp;#x200B;



 Using the Fed categorical data, the next chart shows the current period versus TTM and trailing twenty years. As can be seen, the blue bars are showing higher readings across multiple categories (Food, Housing, Other, and Recreation). Even if the blue bar continues shrinking for Transportation, the Fed still has to hope all the other categories also prove to be transitory. That is a lot to hope for, because if they are wrong, it will be impossible to fight inflation. 

&amp;#x200B;



 

**TL;DR**

CPI may be less transitory than the Fed thought as many categories are still exhibiting growth even after the transitory factors have come back down (e.g. used cars). With PPI surging by 1% as reported this morning, it is only a matter of time before producers pass cost onto consumers. Additionally, if Owners Equivalent Rent starts to reflect the true price of rent increases, then the CPI is going to rock higher.

Unfortunately for the Fed, [they are painted into a corner]( and cannot scale back the monetary stimulus without devastating the economy. Thus, the Fed is not going to fight inflation because it can't. Instead they will keep telling everyone inflation is transitory and hope they are right. If inflation expectations start to increase then it's game over for the Fed because everyone will realize they have been bluffing. Protect yourself with gold and silver. Both remain under pressure as the market anticipates the Fed to tighten. Once they don't tighten, the bull market will resume.",CPI 2021-07: Many price categories are still increasing Discussion,3,2

This is a big claim but based on what i have read and how the institutions like Ontario Teachers Fund ([here is proof]( fully exited the company is worrying.

They propped up the company by lying to investors about turnaround and future prospect while helping big institutions exit the position.

TLDR: trading near all time low on zero bad news. None of this long list has been priced in yet. Meanwhile institutions are buying 21x more than selling.

&amp;#x200B;

In light of China’s recent crackdown on payment processors, FinTech company Paysafe’s strategic move last year to exit those high-risk revenue channels is looking pretty smart. This de-risking will temporarily dampen Q2 YoY revenue growth, as it did with Q1, however, their CC transcripts indicate that tactical exit will likely no longer affect YoY revenue going into Q3 and Q4.

But this upcoming earnings report is less about revenue growth than it is about forward guidance and updates on their ongoing restructuring, acquisition pipeline and how their recent deleveraging will affect margins and free cash flow.

They reported strong FCF growth last quarter and a recent CNNE quarterly report revealed that, along with recently paying down $1.2 billion in debt, upon a Moody's upgrade, Paysafe successfully refinanced their remaining debt. This, overall restructuring could translate to $150+ million in cost savings annually which can dramatically improve their profit, free cash flow and M&amp;A outlook: critical elements of their growth strategy.



EPS

Even if this ER is about forward guidance, there’s a good chance for an EPS beat which will make Q2 Paysafe’s first profitable quarter as a newly public company. Analysts’ average EPS estimate is reported to be 0.01 or 0.02 (depending on the source). We know that in Q1, without the $90+ million in one-time, non-recurring expenses associated with going public and paying down $1.2B debt, they would have beat analysts estimates with a positive EPS. For Q2, they won’t have those expenses so, unless they introduce new costs from refinancing or impairment expenses on intangible assets, there appears to be solid basis for an EPS beat. My loose guess is for 0.05 EPS or better. Not a big deal to me if it doesn’t work out that way, but it’s entirely plausible.



Revenue

Regarding revenue, even though Paysafe is already integrated as a payment processor with 75% of US iGaming operators, let’s ignore the facts that

* many new states have legalized sports betting during Q1/Q2 (see below),
* Paysafe’s Q2 revenue could be bolstered by the strong growth recently reported by its several partners like Wynn, Caesar’s, DraftKings and Penn,
* Paysafe has new revenue streams from recent deals with Coinbase, Microsoft/XBox, Luckbox, Wix, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, PointsBet, Virginia Lottery, Rent Moola, Provena, FoxBet, Golden Nugget etc.,
* Paysafe said early Q2 was already showing signs of record growth: “We continue to be pleased with where the top-line trends are going. We've had some actual record days in e-commerce processing, historical records, not just recovery records, but historical records.”
* or that the American Gaming Association reports sports betting has generated $1.8 billion in the first six months of 2021, 20% more than all of 2020 combined ($1.5B).

Rather than speculate about how much of that new revenue will affect Paysafe’s Q2 balance sheet, I prefer to keep my sights on analysts estimates and Paysafe’s own guidance, which has conservatively excluded US iGaming growth projections (55% CAGR).

Paysafe offers Q2 revenue guidance of $365 - $385 million. With $341 million in revenue for Q1’20, this represents 7% to 13% YoY quarterly growth. We’ve seen very little reason for them to miss this guidance. Quite the contrary.

Analysts’ average Q2 revenue estimate is reported to be between $371.5 million and $378 million (depending on the source). That's right in the middle of guidance. Last quarter, Paysafe came in at the upper range of their guidance which, given all the good news, suggests that there’s a very good chance that they’ll beat the analyst estimate. That would result in around 9% to 11% YoY quarterly growth, which would be a solid improvement from Q1.

As a long-term investor, I’ll be happy with anything above 7%. From there, any upside surprise will be welcome.

Last quarter, Paysafe confirmed their 2021 full year projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume. Paysafe’s already strong $362 million in free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.

This confirmed guidance implies that Q3 and Q4 will likely represent stronger revenue growth to compensate for the sluggish Q1 growth due to the channel exits. By Q3, Paysafe's balance sheet should reflect their many new partnerships and new US state markets opening up to legalized sports betting.



Recent Price Action

As Chairman of the Board Bill Foley recently noted, Paysafe ""has been unduly punished as the inevitable shareholder rotation plays out.""

Over the last few months many sources confirm regular and heavy intraday short volume (not short interest) which has successfully tanked the stock price on nothing but good news from the company. Meanwhile 13F filings continue to reveal institutions loading shares.

\[Side note: Some have a hard time wrapping their heads around this but the SEC allows this type of intraday price manipulation under the shield of making a market. It's a legal loophole that allows market makers to walk down (or up) the price to shake out weak hands in order to fill institutional orders by the end of each day. It doesn't help that many financial news outlets continue to misrepresent Paysafe’s data, claiming they have only 4 employees and falsely reporting a massive Q1 EPS miss of -0.37 and -0.38 (Yahoo/CNBC). It was only 0.02. Such things can definitely deter investors who undertake proper due diligence so, hopefully, these outlets will get around to reporting accurate data.\] But I digress.

While the shenanigans have gone on, bringing the price near all time lows and pushing many retail shareholders to capitulation, Fintel reports institutions are accumulating 21 times more than they are selling. Very recent 13F’s show Susquehanna increased their stake by 48% to over 3 million shares, Citigroup increased their position by 5000% to around 1.3 million shares, Bank of New York Mellon bought half a million shares and BlackRock just opened a new position of 8.3 million shares.

Bottom?

Whoever has been pinning the stock down has always stopped near these current levels because its more or less the price paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares). In fact, the current price is likely below where Wells Fargo bought 13M shares, where BlackRock bought their 8.3M shares and where Blackstone took on another 37 million shares, according to their 13F's.

The current low price poses an interesting opportunity for value investors because, since those major fund managers decided to invest near this level, Paysafe has had zero bad news while steadily executing on their promised strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and as Bill Foley put it, “cross-sell, cross-sell and cross-sell.”

M&amp;A / inorganic growth

Along the lines of value creation, Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, “an aggressive pipeline of M&amp;A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.”

Inorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe’s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge. Foley is a known M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. Yeah, that's 3,600X. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).

Through his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.” 6,9

Foley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: “FIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe – an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.”



Rounding out the Picture:

\#1 global leader in iGaming, #2 digital wallet in the world, and #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It has a transactional volume approaching $100 billion in over 40 currencies.

Through its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion “unbanked” globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.

iGaming Expansion

It's worth repeating that Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.”

Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape. Paysafe’s expertise in multi-jurisdictional regulations is an important aspect of its competitive MOAT (as discussed below). Paysafe is also an integrated back-end payment processor so many users don’t realize they are utlizing their gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.

In the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators.

As Bill Foley says, ""we’re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It’s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.""

He continues, ""It’s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that’s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We’ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It’s pretty exciting”

Fund manager Dan Loeb agrees: “We believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.”

Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, “PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,”

Del Grosso, who gave Paysafe a $19 price target added, “we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.” 5 Some headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:

Analysts universally rate Paysafe as a ""BUY""

Some quotes :

RBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: “We believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.” “recent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE’s business and the FTAC II transaction” and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: “PSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it’s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.” 4

RBC recently reiterated their Outperform rating saying: “Our positive thesis is predicated on three key points including: (1) PSFE has a unique set of assets within the payments space, in that it’s a digital wallet, an integrated payment platform (with \\\~50% tethered to online transactions), and provides an on ramp for cash to be digitized via eCash, and it’s the combination of the three that create a two-sided market (serving both merchants &amp; consumers), (2) new secular growth opportunity in US iGaming, which is in its early innings and could surprise investors to the upside, and (3) Bill Foley (Non-Executive Chairman) and his team have a long history of driving share holder value, which we expect to continue at PSFE.

BMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: “PSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE’s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.” iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow “at more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world” with a ""5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%."" 3

Evercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its “robust risk management operation,” and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' 2



MOAT: “robust risk management operation”

So why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and how is it able offer eCommerce services to the unbanked?

Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : “When we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.”

“We can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players…we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can’t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we’re not only talking about take rates and comps, we’re talking about revenue-generation, we’re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That’s a really, really powerful position to have.” 9



Valuation

A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.

Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),

By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.

Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.

The group's collective growth rate of \~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&amp;A growth (recent new acquisition) nor their current expansion into US iGaming.

Since 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated. This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth. In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the “mid to high teens.” But even if you include 2020’s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal’s current projected growth. Incorporating US iGaming growth will of course reveal a whole new picture.

Given all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers:

Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples:

&amp;#x200B;

* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09
* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91
* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86

Average: $97.95

&amp;#x200B;

More conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100

&amp;#x200B;

* EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75
* EV/Rev ratio : $44.64
* EV/FCF ratio : $44.18

Average : $46.52

&amp;#x200B;

In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe’s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up. Veteran market analyst Steve Grasso's call for ""$45/55"" may actually be quite reasonable.



This is not investment advice. For those who do want to invest in Paysafe, my only advice is to stay away from options. I’ve watched this stock for a long time and the market makers have a track record of ruthlessly blowing up those positions. Common shares is the way.

So I know I'm a little late, but I finally got around to updating my financials to incorporate CLF's recent 10-Q filing - and I'm very surprised. 

My previous PT was $32.25, and after inputting their new data, the **new PT is approximately $41!!!** Morgan Stanley can eat a dick. I'd love to see that ""analysis"". How does a PT of $26 make sense when their NAV alone is $3.5 billion (27% of current market cap)

I.S. from 10-Q



Assumptions:

\- Steel isn't like lumber and won't suddenly fall to normal or historical levels within a month. Lumber skyrocketed due to COVID causing a supply shortage, while demand remained steady. Steel prices have increased not only because of supply shortages &amp; demand increases, but also because of global governmental &amp; political catalysts. China will be announcing export tariffs within the next month before their building season starts in October. These taxes will range between 15-25%. 

\- Steel prices will remain elevated until Late 2022 or Early 2023.

\- Q3 &amp; Q4 financials will closely mimic Q2

\- CLF will continue to pay down debt &amp; return money to shareholders

\- CLF doesn't idle operations due to another covid variant. I think it's very unlikely since they are offering their employees $3,000 to get the shot. LG is a savage. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[CME HRC Futures](

&amp;#x200B;

[Weighted Averages for Pricing](

The analysis above is important because the surge in steel companies is almost solely due to market price increases. 

&amp;#x200B;

From CLF's 10-k and their raised forward guidance:

""The full-year revision is based on better-than-expected contractual renewals and the assumption that the **US HRC index price averages $1,100 per net ton for the last nine months of the year**. "" 

As of 8/11/21 (my 32nd birthday btw), the **weighted average price per ton according to the HRC futures index is $1756 for the rest of 2021**, or in other words, a fucking **56.7% increase** over CLF's assumption that their forward guidance hinges on. 

Now, just because the weighted average of the futures prices is $1756, doesn't mean that CLF has locked in pricing or has contracts at that specific price. However, what it does show that prices have elevated to a greater level than they forecasted, and they are very likely realizing that tailwind.

She withdrew $8K from her pension plan which accumulated over 4 years of working as a government official in Arizona. The stock market was going up so fast that she and her coworkers couldn’t afford NOT to invest. The plan was to make a quick 100% profit and then take her initial capital and put it back in the pension fund.

She only invested in strong companies that could not go down like Pets.com, microstrategy, and Amazon. At the pinnacle, her $8k investment became $19k, but she wasn’t about to paper-hand her golden ticket.

Then the bubble burst. Her original $8k turned into around $4K. She was scared of losing more, so she paper-handed pretty much at the bottom of the market. The irony is that if she had held her positions, they would have been worth a huge amount today.

Anyways, life got in the way so she never put the money back into the pension fund.

The reason this is the most epic loss porn is not because she went from $8k—&gt;$19k—&gt;4k, but because over 20 years later she has the money from selling a rental property to buy back her 4 years. However, the state pension plan is charging 8% compounded interest to buy back those years.

The total she has to pay is ~$55k! She has already decided to move forward with the payment to have a more comfortable retirement, but it essentially means she took an original $8K from her pension and turned it into a -$47k LOSS!

When I posted my first MU DD 16 days ago, the opening price was $75.80 and closing price was $76.30. After my DD, it went up to $83.10, and then it dropped again to $75 until today because of bearish news about DRAM price forecasts. I sold my positions (100 shares at $78.50, and 27 Aug 75c x 10) at $82 on August 6th because I assured that $83.10 on August 4th was the peak before it drops again and the price upward movement was getting weakened since that date.

Here is my first DD that shows the reasons why it has a great upside potential with great fundamentals and great growth guidance.

[

Now, its price went down again to $73.30 in after-market which is discounted A LOT. $72-74 is the best entry point with the lowest risk and the greatest upside potentials since MU is a strong enough to rally and consolidate in the price range of 85-90 once it starts have some more good news, better earnings and growth guidance. I thought yesterday (August 10)'s drop was good enough to be the support line so I bought some 24 Sept 72 Calls since I expect to see $80-90 price range before its next earnings date (Sept 29). One trading tip for Micron is 'Never be too Greedy'. There are too many big hands who are playing their own game with this stock, and we need to sell the greed to make good profits from it before its massive sell offs come first. But then, why would I take a risk to play this intense game with these big hands? Because MU is too good and strong stock that makes its price keeps rallying and it will eventually keeps going up crazily when it starts to gain its momentum. We all know that we must buy GOOD stocks whenever its price drops more that its value. You always buy GOOD stocks when its is undervalued, and before it becomes more popular and becomes a meme stock later. And that is the time to sell when other people finally start to talk about MU and it becomes a MEME stock. Don't be like those kind of people who bought AMD at $115-120, but be like those kind of people who bought AMD at less than $78, or at least at less than $94. Yeah, so the whole point is ""Buying MU at $73.30 is a great choice I think"".

Remember, 86.61% of MU stock is owned by institutions, which means that there will be always a huge sell offs whenever they think it is priced in because institutions need to sell faster than one another to make more profits before it tanks hard. But good thing is that those institutions keep buying it back at the support line which is $72-75 so it eventually rallies back; it means that it has a pretty high volatility, and we can use this high volatility to keep printing our profits if we know when to buy and when to sell without the greed and panicking. And I strongly believe that once it starts to get its momentum back, it has a high chance to break through its ATH $96 and go up to $150-180 in next year.

Additional News after my first DD

**Bullish**

\- Micron launched world's first 176-Layer NAND in mobile solutions to power lightning-fast 5G Experiences. (Now they just need to start running their EUV fab in order to be more competitive with their rivals).

\- Micron declared 10 cent a share Quarterly Dividend (Make big hands feel more secure which can lead to have a less turnover %).

**Bearish**

\- Forecasts of weakening DRAM prices in the fourth quarter. (However, most MU investors perceived this news which means it was already priced in).

[Sourced by Benzinga](

According to Benzinga, they set MU's support line at $74.68 and the resistance line at $95.02. Once it breaks its resistance point at $95, it will be another AMD which will soar rapidly with its crazy momentum.

If you're looking for a stock with potential to 2-3x in the next few month's than look no further. 

The company I am talking about today is Sage therapeutics (SAGE). So what is SAGE? Well it's a biopharmaceutical company committed to developing novel therapies with the potential to transform the lives of people with debilitating disorders of the brain. 

Analytics -

For starters the Average Price Target according to Yahoo Finance is around 92$ a share and it is currently at 42.57$ a share at the time of this writing. Not to mention, even after some confusing Phase 3 results which I will get into later, a few analysts cut price targets from anywhere to 63$-75$ which is still significantly above the share price as of right now. What I find most staggering is SAGE trades at a P/E ratio of roughly 3.64 which is an absolute anomaly. They have $2 billion dollars in cash and next to no debt. This 2 billion dollars was mostly from biogen's recent investment in SAGE. They invested $850 million dollars cash plus an initial $650 million equity stake in the company. They are literally trading at 0 cash/book ratio, off this alone SAGE is completely undervalued because its market cap is about $2.45 billion dollars. YES I KNOW and undervalued stock in todays market? Who would of thought it to be in biotech. SAGE's EPS is also 11.84, and this is from their current drug that is on the market (Zulresso)

Chart Analysis -

Now SAGE has been in a LONG downtrend. It went from 96$ at it's peak in January to $40.81 about a week ago. But it has FINALLY shown signs of turning around. Insiders just recently purchase shares at $56 and $45 respectively. The CEO himself has bought about $2 million dollars worth of shares, this always a bullish sign. It could be part of an insider regular scheduling or some quarterly filing, but nonetheless it's never a bad sign. Anyways, the RSI is oversold on the 1 year and 5 year. The MACD on the 1 year is finally curling up and on the 6 month it's actually broke through which is a great sign. Some volume has been coming in because of the news of insider buying, and there is a MASSIVE gap that needs to be filled from the $66 - $75 dollar range.

We will look at their main drug in their upcoming pipeline as with any biotech stock, it is the most important thing to look at. We've seen with MRNA how a strong pipeline can attract large institutional buys. SAGE has already partnered with Biogen to produce their ""bread and butter"" drug so to speak Zuranolone. Zuranolone is in phase 3 trials. Just a quick side note.... out of 100 drugs that make it to phase 2, about 12 of them make it to phase 3 and then out of those, 6 of them make it to FDA approval. Not to mention SAGE already has a drug out which produces real revenue. 

About Zuranolone- Zuranolone is an investigational medication which is under development by SAGE Therapeutics for the treatment of depressive disorders and a variety of other indications. It is a synthetic, orally active, inhibitory pregnane neurosteroid, and acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor. As I said earlier it is currently in phase 3. Here are some key highlights of the trial: 

- At the Day 15 primary endpoint, zuranolone 50 mg showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in depressive symptoms as measured by HAMD-17 (p=0.0141) compared to placebo

-Rapid onset of treatment effect was seen in HAMD-17 results at Days 3, 8, and 12

-Patients with a response at Day 15 to zuranolone retained on average 86% of their HAMD-17 improvement at Day 42 (4 weeks after dosing ended)

-Zuranolone was generally well-tolerated and demonstrated a safety profile consistent with previous clinical studies; trial completion rate was 90.3% in the zuranolone group

The results were solid and we will monitor the data moving forward but I am confident this will be approved by the FDA.

Link to the results here:



A link and screenshot to all of there pipeline. I won't mention any of them besides Zuranolone above because it is currently the most important. But you can all take a look for yourself. 





I believe this is worth at least 70$ and can be achieved extremely quickly

Anyway there will be a more in depth part 2 coming soon but this should get SAGE on the radar for some of you lads. As always this is not Financial Advice, invest your own money at your own will and all I'm trying to do is educate a few of you retards 

Position : 1300 shares at 45$, as for options I would take a look at the 50c's, liquidity may be shit though

What’s ur thoughts on it…









The company is known for three projects in particular: Palantir Gotham, Palantir Metropolis, and Palantir Foundry. Palantir Gotham is used by counter-terrorism analysts at offices in the United States Intelligence Community (USIC) and United States Department of Defense.
In the past, Gotham was used by fraud investigators at the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, a former US federal agency which operated from 2009 to 2015. Gotham was also used by cyber analysts at Information Warfare Monitor, a Canadian public-private venture which operated from 2003 to 2012. Palantir Metropolis is used by hedge funds, banks, and financial services firms. 
Palantir Foundry is used by corporate clients such as Morgan Stanley, Merck KGaA, Airbus, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.

Palantir's original clients were federal agencies of the USIC. It has since expanded its customer base to serve state and local governments, as well as private companies in the financial and healthcare industries",$PLTR earnings report Pre-Market 08/12 🚀🚀🚀,426,3

&amp;#x200B;

To understand this analysis it's best to read through previous posts; 

Previous posts [1]( [2]( [3]( [4]( [5]( [6]( [7](

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's a lot and you don't want to read it all, but I don't want to have a small dick. We've all suffered! 

&amp;#x200B;

Catch up on forecast; 

&amp;#x200B;

From  [Times to bear: When it makes sense to fade big trends. : wallstreetbets (reddit.com)]( 

&amp;#x200B;

Here was the original forecast; 



&amp;#x200B;

One of the things I've found most useful that I've covered in my posts is the tendency for markets to reverse off parabolic moves into a 161 level. 

 

&gt;Now I know most of you don't give a fuck about 161s, but that's probably because you don't know about the fucking weird sketchy shit that happens around 161s.

 [Why I think a SPX high soon is possible. : wallstreetbets (reddit.com)]( 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the move into the high with fibs drawn off the last pullback in MRNA. 



The highlighted area would have been a very obvious entry in real time if you were using the phases explained.  [ Times to bear: When it makes sense to fade big trends. : wallstreetbets (reddit.com)]( 

&amp;#x200B;

We're matching various conditions we'd need for the model. Phase 6 is a parabolic move, the rush of euphoria. Phase 7 is the dump when price rejects from the 161 level. Phase 7 is the bull trap and using this model you'd have been filling pending orders on the 161 retest (Market went a tiny bit higher and then dumped hard).

&amp;#x200B;



And using this model this was the forecast generated. 



Looks a lot alike. 



I could ""Claim"" that, this isn't actually what I was trying to show in the OP.  I think it's reasonably unlikely the high has been made and the crash has started on this, assuming there's to be a crash. But I actually meant to show a deeper drop (Bear trap) before the high, which I assumed would happen from 440 and not 500. 

I think we're actually in a dummy crash. The start of the trappy section of the trend. Where there's a big drop to trap bears and then a parabolic rally to trap bulls - and then there's a real crash. Typically this is a news loaded part of the move. Prices move fast and volatile and usually there's headlines flying around to explain these.  

If we are in the dummy crash, it should stop by around 38% retracement. And then start to aggressively uptrend. Going parabolic 20% after breaking the high. Then settling into a longer and slower top - a top usually takes a long time to form. We could still be a considerable amount of time away from the top in this.  

We may only be in this section of a top (This is a template of common stages I see in tops I use generically, it's not fitted to this move). 

&amp;#x200B;



Looking at the small timeframe price action on the break in MRNA it matches quite a lot of the common parts of this topping pattern (I can ""Claim"" this one. These were moves I was talking about when I made this template. Market breaks off highs). 

&amp;#x200B;



So all of these are flagging up heavy bearish signals, but where things go devastatingly wrong for bears is when they confuse this move with the start of a big crash and it turns out in a big timeframe perspective we're actually here.  



And that this is going to start to trend back upwards aggressively through the big down day candles and then spike these out by approximately 20 - 25% before making a real top. 



When we have sharp pullbacks we can draw 161's off them and if this is to be the last bear trap before the real crash typically we're going to see the crash starting somewhere between the 161 and 220 fibs. Over the 220 fib level price is telling you this is not working. This is not a ""Right eventually"" strategy - small zones are defined in which the probability are more favourable. 

Here would be our forecast with that.  Interestingly the 161 rule matches the ""Above 20%"" rule. And with these two independent factors agreeing we'd also still have to see price going parabolic into that level to give us a confirmed short setup. So as price is heading into the 575 - 600 zone we'd have a very well planned trade.  Very defined shorting plan.  



**Bear porn** 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where it gets fucky - and this is the only reason I care about telling people, tbh. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the trade we've just seen in MRNA in the SPX. Instability section of 2018 and 2019 into the strong breakout. Hits a 161. Price changes direction.  There was news. I know that's a fact - but this was also exactly on the 161. That's also a fact. There's only one way to draw this swing. Only one high, only one low. Hit the 161 of it. 

&amp;#x200B;



The market would drop about 30% ... This is the ""Known"" typical ratio of the last bear trap. 

When that happened, it would have been possible to do the same thing we've just done with MRNA. If we think a crash can come, we can make a plan that if it gets into a new high, and then it goes parabolic during that new high, with it going parabolic to about 20 - 25% above the high, then we can short it - only if this is also a 161 extension. 

And this gives signals here. 



Using this model is not flagging up a lot of random signals to short things because ""The stock's not worth this much"" - that should work, but it fucking doesn't.  Circled in blue are places where using this you're likely to pick up short signals in real time (Some would lose). And in red is all the places people associate shorting with when they think it always loses. We're not trading those areas.



With that in mind, a combination of the things covered in '[When to Bear]( and '[Why I think SPX High](  there is a strong case built up for shorting as it headed into 4,000 and while it is in the 4,000 - 4,750 sort of range. If it breaks over the 220 fib, this would be reason to exit bear trades. It will be right soon, or it won't be. It's not an ""Eventually strategy"". 

If SPX was to be following this model, the next big swing's rules would be; 

* Drops approximately 50% - 60%
* This spikes out low of big bear trap

&amp;#x200B;

Two rules, both have to match. Which they would if price was to fall from the 161. 

&amp;#x200B;



I want to reiterate, there is usually new news that comes along with big price moves, but to have done all the things required to flag up this area as the area in which you'd be most interested in shorting could all be done during 2020.  Like we can with MRNA today. 

&amp;#x200B;



&amp;#x200B;

Updates when MRNA moves a bit. If it crashes it's really fucking up my example. 

&amp;#x200B;

Model implies;

*  Long MRNA while under 390. Stop loss 330.
* Look for strong trending properties. 
* There will be sharp dips, these are good buys.
* Plan to short into 575 - 650 sort of zone, if price action is parabolic into here.
* Expect the news into the high to be positive for the asset, it usually is. 
* Often pop comes on bad news.",MRNA trade plan and tendencies at the end of a trend.,54,2

Just wanna add couple things to my [previous post](

\- EIA reported their [short term forecast]( for August 2021 (don't be lazy and have a look). The most interesting part is about gasoline prices forecast:

&gt;The front-month futures price of RBOB (the petroleum component of gasoline used in many parts of the country) settled at $2.29 per gallon (gal) on August 5, up 3 cents/gal from July 1. The RBOB–Brent crack spread (the difference between the price of RBOB and the price of Brent crude oil) increased by 13 cents/gal to settle at 60 cents/gal during the same period. The crack spread on July 30 of 55 cents/gal was the highest July crack spread since July 31, 2015. July’s high RBOB–Brent crack spread reflected increasing demand and decreasing inventories. We estimate U.S. gasoline consumption averaged 9.4 million barrels per day (b/d) in July, which is 0.9 million b/d (11%) higher than in July 2020, and only 0.2 million b/d (2%) lower than the pre-COVID-19 July 2019 level. The increase in gasoline demand likely reflects typical seasonal factors such as increased summer driving demand, especially around the July 4th holiday weekend. For the week ending July 2, we reported in our Weekly Petroleum Status Report that gasoline product supplied was 10.0 million b/d, a record high in our data, which goes back to 1991. Product supplied is the volume of petroleum products delivered out of the primary supply chain, rather than the actual amount of gasoline consumed by end users that week. An individual week’s amount of product supplied could be affected by a number of factors, such as the timing of when import or export cargoes clear customs. Nevertheless, this record product supplied level likely indicates that driving demand was high in late June and early July. Although gasoline consumption remains below 2019 levels, the July 2021 estimate is the closest gasoline consumption has been to its corresponding 2019 level so far in 2021. The relatively high consumption has contributed to gasoline stocks decreasing to 228.5 million barrels in July, the lowest July level since 2015. We forecast lower gasoline stocks between August and November, which will likely continue to support relatively high crack spreads.

I bring you a DD on $WISH that means nothing because I have no clue what I’m talking about.

TLDR: $WISH good.

Overview:
ContextLogic Inc. has been overlooked as another IPO flop, catalyzed by an ongoing lawsuit and shitty earnings reports. However, Wall Street targets, cash on hand, future expansion and the current put/call ratio suggest an alternative narrative for $WISH.

Sentiment:
Perhaps the most notable statistic is ContextLogic's ~0.32 put/call ratio. With greater call volume than many industry competitors, it's hard to say that investors aren't expecting some bullish movement. With an IPO price far above fair value, it's understandable that $WISH has been hit hard. But a valuation at $9.86 (Aug 11, 2021), less than half of its $24 IPO price (Dec 2020), seems like a heavy pullback. With over 2/3 of options traders betting the price will rise – it's easy to guess how the public feels about ContextLogic's future growth.

Wall Street:
As dumb as the big boys are, they move the market. Galileo (PTC) Ltd, Formation8 GP, LLC and Founders Fund V Management, LLC are a few of the top $WISH hodlers managing over $3.5B USD in investment value. Other institutions with bullish positions include JS Capital Management LLC and Morgan Stanley.
Price targets set by corporate analysts put ContextLogic shares at a low of $12.00 (+20.2%), a median of $17.50 (+75.4%) and a high of $24.00 (+140.5%) as of July 2022. $WISH currently trades near an all time low, projected to see rebounding heights in the coming year.

Earnings:
The upcoming August 12, 2021 Q2 earnings report TOMORROW 🚀 will be a significant catalyst for ContextLogic in the short-term. Whether initial traction is up or down – a young, volaltile IPO is bound to see massive movement. Analysts predict Q2 to still present a negative EPS value, but this time at -0.14, which is a far cry from the -3.04 EPS back in Q4 2020. If $WISH can beat these predictions and near the breakeven point, the company's $2 billion on hand will propel its growth ventures into EOY.

Position: 727 @ 12.41

As you know $SDC  recently had a horrible earnings (due to cyberattack, covid) and some other issues.  Their stock tanked from $7 to $5 after the earnings.  However one thing stood out!  If you look at the past, company insiders have a habit of buying the stock when it's low.  This is from OpenInsider since 2020.  Buying below 10 and selling when it's above 10.

Sysco is the the largest distributor of food to...well...everyone.  Restaurants, Prisons, Schools, Hospitals just name it.  If it serves food there's probably a Sysco truck pulling up in front of it at some point during the week.  They are the last mile when it comes to food distribution.  They also sell paper goods, trash bags and almost everything else you need to operate a restaurant or bar (excluding booze).

This week the stocked jumped up on a strong fiscal Q4 that ended on July 3rd.  Better than expected everything.  Why's that important?  Because their fiscal Q4 was a 14 week quarter that included April and May where capacity restrictions remained in place in many of their major markets.  Orders were still low.  Their fiscal Q1 is going to blow this out of the water.  The past few months in hospitality have been absolutely fucking bonkers with revenue up anywhere between 20 - 30%.  Pandemic ""ended"" and people came out and came out a lot.  These numbers are beginning to steady a little but are still way up and even if mask mandates come back into play no one is expecting revenues to drop to pre-pandemic levels any time soon.

The other major factor here is the absolute dick punch hospitality is taking from the price increases in almost every area we buy from.  Not just good for Sysco.  Great for Sysco.  Normally restaurants like to pick and choose their distributors, spreading orders based on price and and quality.  Now that chicken is at a 3 decade high along with everything else, restaurants are scrambling to renegotiate with distributors and it's all heading to Sysco.  Because of their scale, they're pricing is annihilating everyone else.  In addition to the massive revenue bump you're also going to see a massive influx of new customers and customers ordering more and more of their products through the company.

This is  an entertainment/comedy-nonfactual post. I'm a retard  posting on WSB  with a bias due to having a very large position of my portfolio in $F.  So, Don't act on anything posted in here and proceed on your own risk...)

**1- Ford's secret weapon unleashed:**

For the last **44 consecutive years**, the F-150 has been Americas **best selling Truck**. In 2019, the Ford F-Series was **second only to the Apple iPhone**, which  raked in **$55 billion**, in terms of **total revenue** generated. The F-Series **generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined**, Just something to think about.

On May 19, Ford has unveiled its EV F-150 after Biden had driven it a week prior. The EV's features are mind blowing exceeding all expectations (Watch MKBHD review or Fords 5 min ad video). It has all the features crucial for it's **target buyers** (Construction workers, Farmers, Free-lance delivery drivers, Basically hardworking Blue-collar Americans...) and it's **a Truck which actually looks like a Truck.** “Ford knows what pickup owners want,” IHS Markit senior analyst Stephanie Brinley said. More importantly, it's an F-150 first, an EV second, Ford didn't abandon the F-150 core design which has been successful for 44 consecutive years.

The reservation now have exceeded 120,000 since it's debut. An important point the CEO mentioned on the call was that **about 75%, or 90,000, are new to Ford, according to the company!** If anything, this indicates that Ford is the runner up for Tesla in the EV competition. almost every car manufacturer can make an EV, but only a few (I can count on one hand) can supply enough cars to keep up with demand with superb price and quality.

Now Ford's EVs are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EVs to compete with TESLA and they are destroying Tesla for the past 4 months with sales, more on this on #5). The F-150 starts at  $32,500 after Federal tax credit!! Cheaper than any of **""Potential(because they don't exist yet)""** competitors with superior car features.

It's relevant to mention that Ford's EV sales (counting electric vehicles and hybrids) increased 177% during June, capping off 56,570 units sold so far in 2021.

**As Ford promised, F-150 Lightning will deliver more features, and cost less...**

^(Don't forget about potential upcoming Ford SUVs, and a Bronco EV which might be announced this year.)

**2- Ford Rivian Partnership:**

Ford-Backed EV Automaker Rivian is planning to IPO as soon as September. It's looking for a valuation of 70Billion which is valued more than Ford Right now 😂(Ford is 55.64B at 14.18$). Ford has initially invested 500$ million in Rivian, but it added much more of an undisclosed amount with **the most recent news being 902$million in Q1 of 2021.**

**On Jul 23, it was announced that Rivian closed a $2.5 billion funding round,** led by existing investors **Ford**, Amazon and T. Prior to it, they announced plans to open a second manufacturing plant and U.S States started submitting bids on it.

Farley is quick to say Ford did not invest in the Michigan startup to make money in the stock market. **As more companies continue to invest in Rivian, Ford benefits from the increased value of its shares,** ""but that's not why we invested,"" Farley said in an interview with MotorTrend.

Farley with his 3D chess moves is probably investing in it to make a move to dominate the EV-SUV market too **with a Lincoln or Explorer-Rivian car**. He understands that **the first move is the most important one in the EV Game,** and with the Mach-E and F-150, Ford executed it's moves perfectly! Farley wants to take as much of the market share as possible with low prices, high quality, while maintaining the demand(something which Tesla still isn't able to). Ford can do that due to their international factories and cheap oversees labor mentioned in Part 1.3

&amp;#x200B;

**3- Bronco capturing Buyers of other brands:**

Prior to the release of the Bronco, it had 190,000 reservations. **66% of the reservations were converted to sales!** Additionally, Farley mentioned in the earnings call that 70% of the 125,000 orders it has are customers of other brands.

According to Ford, dealers are keeping Broncos on the lot for an average of **15 days!,** with a big chunk of of the buyers coming from jeep. People are killing to get their hands on one. just go on Ebay and see for yourself. Bronco first Edition is going for 6 figures with the buy now being approx 150K$.

I would understand PS5 scalpers, but that happening with Cars, I never would've imagined. This shows how the demand of this car is insane and why Ford raised it's 2021 Revenue expectation from $3.5 billion, to between $9-$10 billion and they'll probably raise it again in the next quarter.

&amp;#x200B;

**4- Ford's Governmental Fleet 3D chess Strategy:**

“Ford clearly has business and government fleets in mind,” Autotrader executive analyst Michelle Krebs said.

Ford revealed details of a less powerful version of its upcoming 2022 F-150 Lightning electric pickup for business and government fleets on Monday. Called the Lightning Pro, it’s equipped with a standard battery that’s good for an estimated 230 miles and costs $39,974, which is the base price for retail F-150 Lightnings.

Ford's vision to lead the EV market has a “no-brainer” component Elon Musk lacks: Targeting business and government fleet customers with new battery-powered trucks and vans. Ford’s focus on converting Gas fleet buyers to electric models builds on the company’s existing strengths and takes advantage of an opportunity created by Federal tax cuts. They know that they are already the best with no competitors when it comes to the quality or price of the F-150. They will literally destroy their competitors with this approach.

# 5- Valuation and Price target

Yes, I'm crazy, but hear me out. It's obvious what argument I'm going to bring up next(Tesla valuation), but it's not only about that and I'll expand more about what I mean to convey.

$Ticker - Market Cap - TTM Revenue MM - TTM EBITDA MM - Revenue Multiple - Ebitda Multiple

(Numbers referenced from -/JeffAmazon- outdated)

TSLA - $679.7B - $31.54B - $4.27B - 21.1X - 202X

NIO - $77.35B - $12B - ($7B) - 7.6X - (NaN)

GM - $74B - $116B - $18B - 0.7X - 4.3X

F - $47.17B - $127.14B - $10B - 0.3X - 4.4X

**(Important part starts here)**

As you can see, this is crazy and retarded at the same time... Take any of the stocks above and compare it to $F, it'll always come out undervalued relatively speaking. For the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations, don't lie to yourselves. Your business degree doesn't work in this market meta. **These highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations. In meme stocks, retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve.** $F is superior in most financial metrics compared to the EV meme stocks(imo), yet it's still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them.

If you are new to WSB, **$TSLA and $AMD were among our first great plays in here**, before $GME. We used to yolo deep OTM calls on $TSLA when the Press(mainly CNBC), analysts on social media, and boomers were all short $TSLA. When $TSLA was 350$(presplit), people on here were buying 1000$(Pre-split) calls!!! When it reached $1000$(pre-split) some yoloers in here bought 3000$ calls. We were the original adopters of $TSLA and we rose it to what it is today. Still not convinced? put a side by side chart comparison between $TSLA and $GME and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event. It's mind boggling.

At that valuation(110$), it won't even be 50% of Tesla's 52-week high valuation. It's a highly speculative valuation, but I don't see Ford being inferior to the other EV stocks. Don't even get me started on Chinese BS EV stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries... Why raise fat foreign Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..)(metaphorically speaking) when Americans can literally raise a malnourished All American baby $F **🇺🇸 🦅**.

**Ford is ready to dominate the EV market and it's just starting!**

Today's pick is a beaten-down stock, and looks like it's poised for a massive recovery. In this market, where everything seems to go up, there still remain opportunities and this stock is a prime example of that, I'm talking about $SDC, Smile Direct Club.

&amp;#x200B;

SDC essentially competes with Invisalign in braces. They make aligners to straighten your teeth, nothing too fancy. You can't use their products for the most complicated cases, but works great for milder cases. However, their pricing clearly undercuts traditional braces and reduce the cost of wearing traditional braces ($5'800 on average for braces to $1950)

&amp;#x200B;

SDC **dropped 25%** just yesterday after earnings. They reported

* $174m or **62.7% growth** year over year
* Net loss of $(55)m or an **improvement of 41.6%** year over year
* Adjusted EBITDA of $(22)m, a **decrease of $2m** year over year
* Diluted EPS of $(0.14), a **44% improvement** year over year

These numbers are great especially considering the extremely cheap valuation and all the headwinds the company faced last year. Most of the issues they faced are one-off expenses and the company is slowly going to get to profitability. Keep in mind that this isn't your typical Pump and Dump ultra high growth stock, this is a **value play.**

&amp;#x200B;

On their earnings call they said that they were negatively impacted by a cyber attack in April, the lasting economic effects of COVID-19, and the slower scaling of international markets due to COVID. However, they are planning to relaunch in Germany and Spain this year and will resume focus on acquiring new customers. This is essentially a new chapter for their business, as they are going to be more aggressive on their customer acquisition and expansion into new markets.

&amp;#x200B;

It's important to note that the long-term story for SDC is intact and looks very promising, as they turn their business around to avoid these short-term one-off issues. SDC has a vertically-integrated platform and a very unique way of operating that prevents any other competitors from stealing their business. This is crucial to their business and is what will eventually allow them to grow profitably.

&amp;#x200B;

Short-sellers seem to have forgotten the long-term growth story of SDC and have just thrown away the stock, and this down move is unjustified, as the future is very bright for SDC. Analysts have all come out and downgraded the stock which pushed prices down even more. The company is expected to grow about 20% this year and 24% in 2022. For a value play, have you ever seen numbers like that, this is not your average boomer stock. I can clearly see a path where this company becomes profitable this year, as they really seem to have shifted focus on **growing profitability.**

&amp;#x200B;

They could clearly receive a buy-out from Align technologies or another healthcare company. At this valuation, I think major health care companies, manufacturing companies are seriously doing due diligence on SDC. I would clearly see P&amp;G or another conglomerate getting interested in SDC at these prices.

&amp;#x200B;

Positions:

60x 5$ Calls

10000 Shares

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: $SDC just got slammed on earnings yesterday and dropped 25% to $5. $SDC is a great value play at this cheap valuation. As they shift their focus towards profitability, the recovery to $10. Hop aboard with dirt-cheap calls.**

Essentially they grew 10% even though their equipment was undergoing safety upgrades. They expect to be somewhere around or above 1b run rate by end of q4- they were cryptic in their guidance. They continue to bring machines online and they believe their legacy stores will continue to grow market share. Price targets still anticipate 40% upside with high target representing 60%+

Some interesting info from my mattress firm contacts. Purple previously was not able to compete with the big names on commissions. Purple is now making steps to be more competitive and therefor incentivize salespeople at furniture stores.

Mattress firm rumors are swirling that Intellibed may be cut from their offering, this means purple will be the ONLY gel matrix available in the largest mattress re-seller in the world.

I've been keeping up with electric buses, but my company has yet to take the plunge due to the relatively large infrastructure investment.

Given the recent Senate bill that was passed, I think we might reconsider.

I'm just one person, with one agency.

There are 480,000 school buses in America.

There are 70,000 mass transit buses.

6,800 organizations that provide some form of mass transit.

Of these, 95 percent of school buses are diesel and 50 percent of mass transit buses are diesel.

Needless to say, the market potential is enormous.

The senate infrastructure bill contains language that will include $7.5 billion for electric vehicle infrastructure. (1)

The bill still requires the House to pass it, and that may occur as early as late September to early October.

That money will go a very long way to making agencies on the fences about procuring electric buses, come off of it.

I expect the Feds will reimburse agencies and or communities who apply for these funds at over 80% (2), all the funds will surely be used.

So, the infrastructure will be built for a reason, to power up electric vehicles, and in this case, electric buses.

Who makes them, who are the top electric bus producers?  (3)

AB Volvo (Sweden)

BYD (China)

**Proterra (America)**

VDL Groep (Netherlands)

Yutong (China)

**The Department of Transportation and The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) mandate that one can only use federal funds to buy buses if they contain more than 70% of its parts manufactured in the USA (4)**

Simply put,

FTA  ""you want $1 million to buy that bus?""

You ""Yes""

FTA  ""Well, the bus has to be comprised of more than 70% American parts, or I don't give you the money, *capiche*?

You ""ok""

**Proterra is the only large electric bus manufacturer in America. (5)**

This gives them a very clear advantage with regard to meeting the Buy America requirements, and therefore winning the bid, and earning the sell.

# 

Today is their earnings announcement, after hours.

What is expected?

I'm long, so I hope their revenue has increased substantially.

That being said, it is possible that Covid related supply chain issues etc, will decrease this. One example of this occurring took place in Idaho who placed an order for 12 Proterra buses in January 2020, and expected the buses to be delivered by late 2020 (6). Most of the buses were delayed, however, and now most will not be delivered until late 2021 (7.)

In the bus world, you don't get paid, until you deliver.

I could see their revenue numbers being down from expected perhaps. So the key thing to focus on is their current confirmed orders and especially those that will be delivered sooner (by end of 2021). This will provide a deeper understanding of their financial position.

Today, if they miss their revenue, I expect them to meet or exceed their deliverables and confirmed orders.

I also think that going forward, especially in Q3 and Q1 2022, you will start seeing Proterra's revenue moving up on a consistent basis as they make up for covid losses with production.

The risk-reward is much more asymmetric now that PTRA is trading much lower than a few months ago. I also think that PTRA is suffering from a SPAC stigma, and that will soon go away as the revenue begins to increase. LUCID is still up 140% on the year (market cap $39 billion) and is barely built any cars. PTRA has sold 600, and each of these costs approximately $1 million, its market cap is $2.43 billion. Not apples to apples, but you get my point.

&amp;#x200B;

# TLDR

**I am long PTRA.**

**I think it has reached a fair price to start a position.**

**I think it will go up in price in the medium to long term even if it misses its revenue in the short term. Many delays can be attributed to Covid, and revenue should return, as they start delivering buses.**

**It's will be buoyed by federal funds that will be released after the House signs the infrastructure bill, sometime in late September-October. This will boost EV infrastructure, which makes it easier to operate electric buses.**

**It enjoys a significant advantage by being located in America, as it is much easier for agencies who procure their buses to use federal funds and meet the federal Buy America clause.**

**I see opportuny here, risk is much lower than a few months ago, and the future could be very bright for Proterra.**

I ended up taking everything and putting them in on call options, I'm up about +400% now.

How hard am I? Nucor Steel hard.

On a more serious note, now that I'm a ten-thousandaire how much should I put away for taxes once I realize these gains? I do have to pay taxes on this right?

According to señor [Investopedia]( 

&gt; When call options are exercised, the premium paid for the option is included in the cost basis of the stock purchase. Take for example an investor who buys a call option for Company ABC with a $20 strike price and June 2020 expiry. The investor buys the option for $1, or $100 total as each contract represents 100 shares. The stock trades at $22 upon expiry and the investor exercises the option. The cost basis for the entire purchase is $2,100. That's $20 x 100 shares, plus the $100 premium, or $2,100. 

&gt;Let's say it is August 2020 and Company ABC now trades at $28 per share. The investor decides to sell their position. A taxable short-term capital gain of $700 is realized. That's $2,800 in proceeds minus the $2,100 cost basis, or $700.

So if I bought NUE Calls with a $165 strike, but it only hit $150 when I sell - do I only pay taxes on 

**Total Sale Proceeds - Original Purchase Cost**

And then it would be considered a short-term capital gain? 

If my income is &lt; $40k then 0 or 15% if between $40k and $441k?

When you walk through them and see that one is x6 leverage (🚀) and one is x35 (🚀🚀🚀🚀) it opens your eyes and makes you think a bit more carefully about what you're doing so you don't accidentally do something too safe. 

I like to follow the philosophy that if you can't teach something you don't understand it well enough so I made this into a video that explains this entirely using PowerPoint icons, which is linked at the bottom. I'm going to explain everything here though because I know clicking a link is a lot of work. 

When I did this math Visa was trading at $243.17 per share. Visa might not be a classic around here but look at that 5 year graph, you literally can't lose. You can buy a call (🚀) with a strike price of 240 that expires September 17th for $853. This call has a delta of about 0.59. I'm assuming the people here at least know that delta exists and where to find it. This means that this option currently moves up and down with the “power” of 59 shares. If this option moves deeper in the money this number will increase. If this option moves out of the money this number will decrease. 

Knowing that this option moves as if it were 59 shares is the key to finding its leverage (🚀🚀🚀). 59 shares at Visa’s current price would cost $14,347 but you only need to pay $853 for this contract, what a deal, which has the same ability to make or lose money. So with $14,347 you could buy 16 of these contracts (🚀) which means this contract has about 16 times leverage (🚀🚀🚀🚀). You can calculate this exactly by dividing $14,347 by 853 to get the amount of leverage at that moment, which is 16.82. So, every dollar you put into these Visa calls is going to gain or lose almost 17 times more than if you just bought shares. 

A 2 year call on AAPL could be as conservative as 2x leverage and a daily UPRO call could have 100x (🚀🚀🚀🚀). Know what you're getting yourself into before you throw your money into something like x2 leverage. 

For the big brains out there, this is a minor greek called lambda.

🚀🚀🚀🚀
TLDR: Option Leverage = (Delta * Share Price) / Option Price
🚀🚀🚀🚀

Example: Visa 240c 9/17 = (59 * 243.17) / 853 = 16.82

If you wish to consult the stock market gods just look at [Dr PP's latest tweets]( for a few minutes and check for any patterns. My go-to is that they usually all contain words.

If any of your rolls today turn out to be bad, [publicly execute the cursed die as a lesson to the others]( As for what kind of dice, see below. It's mostly personal risk tolerance.

4. Prepare your strategy list. Just go to [a list like this one]( if you don't know any. Take the ones with cool names and write them down. I recommend the double diagonal because it looks like [Batman]( Once you have your list, just number them. I recommend numbering them in order but that's optional.

5. Select a strategy. Depending on how long your list is you may want to use a die, but dartboards and roulette wheels are proven to work just as well.

6. Now that you've got a strategy it's time to determine your strike prices. Roll a die to see how far in/out the money you are going to be.  Remember to use point number three for guidance. If it's a multi-leg strategy like a debit spread, use this for the closer strike. If it's multiple spreads like a condor, make it symmetric. Or don't.

7. If your strategy is a spread, use another die to roll spread width. Remember, smaller spreads lose faster. So don't use a D20 unless you're a certified pussy.

8. Roll another die for leverage. If you don't have margin left I recommend a home equity loan, max out your credit card if grandma hasn't croaked yet and you rent. Payday loan sharks are a great choice as well. The bigger the die you use here, the better.

9. Now we have our investment set up. Queue it up on Robinhood so it gets filled the instant market opens. If your broker doesn't allow market orders, just ask for no credit or enter a bigger debit than spread width. The faster you get filled the more time your money can make more money for you.

10. Expect Robin Hood risk management to liquidate your account an hour or two before market close. If you were way in the green and RH RM shoves a huge red dildo up your ass by being worse than national best offer, get used to it. If they don't close your position you may be really fucked.

If any of you do this for a week straight and don't go bankrupt I'll go to Walmart and buy you tendies from a brand of your choice.

Array has had a rough time so far as a public company, with shares opening at over $36 upon IPO, only to recently settle in the $15 range.

Steel costs rocketed higher this winter and spring leading to an unexpected guidance pull from the company. In my opinion, this is a temporary issue.

Commodity mismanagement is certainly a ding to management's credibility, however the recently announced Nucor supply deal does provide a backstop.

Array boasts a high quality and in demand product that is essential to the solar industry, making this potentially an opportune time to build a position.

Array Technologies (ARRY) burst onto my radar screen upon the company's IPO in October 2020. I was quite curious about the company and its products due to the alternative energy boom currently engulfing the energy industry worldwide.

What I found in my initial research during the company's IPO process was a wonderful, innovative company, with one of the best solar tracking products in the marketplace, along with a stock that upon IPO, was significantly overvalued.

In this article, I would like to explore the recent crash in the price of Array Technologies and present my thesis for why this may be a great time to build a position in the company.

**Overview**

The first quarter of 2021 for Array was certainly one to forget, while demand continued to rip along at a record pace, costs for steel and shipping the company's products more than doubled.

 BC-Steel-Going-Into-Biden’s-Infrastructure-Plan-Reaches-New-RecordSource: COMEX

With rolled steel accounting for greater than half of the cost of goods sold at the company, along with no hedging program of note in place, the company pulled guidance pending a review of the impact, sending the stock tanking to the range that we find currently.

Chart

Data by YCharts

To those unfamiliar with Array Technologies, the main product that they produce are solar trackers. The basic concept behind a solar tracker is to keep the solar panels at a solar power generation plant pointed at the sun at the proper angle needed for maximum energy capture at all times.

Solar trackers are certainly not a new thing in the industry, however perfecting the system is surprisingly complex. The tracking system acts like a mobile weather station, adjusting panels minutely based on cloud cover, humidity, temperature and acting as a damage control system for the panels in case of high winds or hailstorms.

In addition, tracking systems have now added a machine learning layer by gathering system generation data and optimizing panel position based on previous site-specific experience.

Solar tracking systems have certainly come a long way from the relatively simple, algorithmic based systems of a decade ago and Array claims to have the best in the business.

**It would certainly appear that they can back up the claim per SEC filings:**

TÜV Rheinland PTL, an internationally-recognized testing, inspection and certification company that has been providing independent evaluations of equipment used in solar energy projects for more than three decades, found that projects using Array's tracker system would achieve a 6.7% lower LCOE, 4.5% higher net present value, and 31% lower operations and maintenance cost than projects that used competing single row control architectures.

The solar tracking market is dominated by Array Technologies, Nextracker, PV Hardware and Arctech Solar with Nextracker and Array holding the number 1 and 2 positions, respectively. This is a rapidly growing market both domestically and internationally due to the relatively recent mainstream adoption of mechanical tracking systems over fixed systems.

Solar Tracker Market Opportunities and Demand (2020-2026) | See Key

See Source: Fortune Business Insights

International expansion is firmly on the company's mind going forward as the benefits of Array's tracking system are not geographically limited, in fact, the company's lower installation costs, agnostic panel compatibility and generous terrain accommodations make the system quite attractive in foreign markets around the globe.

The company has noted international expansion as a key growth driver going forward and recently signed large deals in Spain and Australia with nearly 22% of deals closed in 2020 in foreign jurisdictions.

Commodity Pressures

The company clearly has quite a lot going for it. In my opinion, the company has the best offering available in the solar tracking market, in addition, the solar industry is clearly showing no signs of slowing down any time soon.

The Achilles' heel to the story so far in 2021 has been the unprecedented rise in commodity costs hitting the company squarely in the largest input factors available for its product, literally, the nuts and bolts.

As I showed in a graph earlier, rolled steel prices have now hit the highest price in history and did so in a period of only a few months' time. Rolled steel has always been a volatile product but a 200%+ rise in a few months is unheard of, even for steel prices.

This has clearly caught Array squarely off guard as projects that were quoted and signed in August, September or even October 2020 at a 20-25% margin would now be produced and sold at a significant loss.

As a result of the rapid rise in steel prices and scarce inventory, the company has entered into a long-term supply agreement with Nucor (NUE) to secure product availability. In addition, the company expects to renegotiate contracts currently under production to pass along the increased costs associated with the meteoric rise.

The miniscule silver lining to the story is that Array estimates that all solar tracking providers are equally or even more so affected by this development. As a larger player in the industry, the company believes that they are positioned better than other players in the ability to secure contracts such as the Nucor supply agreement during this period, making renegotiations easier as they can at least guarantee providing a product.

Management clearly deserves a hefty helping of blame for the current situation as a decent hedging program and a supply agreement such as the recent Nucor deal could have benefitted the company immensely. Hindsight thinking serves no purpose unless you learn from your mistakes and it is clear that management is actively navigating the current environment in a proactive manner.

In my opinion, the current steel price is clearly not sustainable. The rise in steel prices can be attributed to a perfect storm of low inventories due to COVID shutdowns, unemployment benefits keeping workers home longer than they likely needed to and the euphoria created by the infrastructure bill proposed by the Biden administration.

**Each of these factors is temporary in nature and with hot rolled prices reaching $1800 a ton, steel mills will be firing on all cylinders soon enough.**

Steel production and utilization rates as of March 2021 were already back to 87.5% of pre COVID levels and with the type of gangbuster margins to be had by steel producers currently, I see the below graph going up and to the right much further in the months to come. Steel mills in driver seat a year after Covid hit US

Source: American Iron and Steel Institute

It may take 6 months, it may take 2 years, but steel prices will certainly not remain at these levels permanently. In addition, even if steel prices do stay elevated, the problem for Array is mostly due to contracts already signed and in production. For future contracts, the company has the ability to quote spot prices in negotiations if needed to maintain healthy margins.

A tracking system currently makes up only around 12% of the capital expenditure of a utility scale solar project, giving a potential rise in costs a margin of safety in regard to the viability of any said project.

See Source: Bloomberg graph (sorry I have not included any of the graphs but they are verifiable)

Bottom Line

Array Technologies appears to have a wonderful product, in a durable, fast-growing sector of the economy. It also appears to be the victim of a temporary bottleneck that is likely to be resolved in a somewhat reasonable time frame.

The stock has tanked by nearly 70% from its $51.05 high shortly after the IPO. I personally found the stock to be significantly overvalued upon IPO and was originally interested in purchasing at a $25 price point.

Thanks to the steel price bonanza, I was able to purchase a sizable position for a cost basis around $15. This may take some time to play out given the commodity market is notoriously hard to predict; however, fundamentally the shift to solar power is extremely likely to continue onwards and upwards in the future and in my opinion, Array currently has the best product available for utility scale projects.

Earnings estimates for Array currently are nothing more than guesses due to the plethora of moving parts such as renegotiations, steel prices, cancellations etc., so I am going to refer to prior estimates for a guidepost of steady state earnings once the situation stabilizes.

Prior to the steel price explosion, Array was estimated to earn $1.04 in 2022. In addition, the company was estimated to grow EPS at close to a 20% rate for the next 5 years.

I view Array basically the same as I did at the IPO, only with a longer fuse to account for the time needed for stabilization. I would currently place fair value of the company at $21, assigning a 20 PE to shares based on normalized potential earnings power, making this investment roughly 33% undervalued in my opinion.

In the current market environment, a 33% discount looks pretty good to me and I plan to continue to nibble at shares on weakness.

It’s funny that the Roth analyst that issued the $25 price target yesterday mentioned that if they leverage their steel pricing they could see a significant rise in share price. Now they have a deal with Nucor.","Array Technologies (ARRY) A Mispriced Opportunity, Infrastructure Play In Alternative Energy",24,7

Here’s Why:

1. Members growth 110% YOY (now at 2.3M). SOFI rolled out a ton of credit card promotions and new account bonuses. If just 10% of wsb users sign up for the free money alone, that’s a 43% increase in their membership base, which would blow their quarterly metrics and analyst expectations out of the water.
2. App store Top #4 app: SoFi app was #122 May, #102 in June, #5 yesterday, and now #4.
3. Their Galileo platform services 70 million accounts (130% YOY growth) and is used by many major Fintech companies (Samsung, MoneyLion, Monzo, SoFi, Vala, Wise etc). Galileo is used by RobinHood and nearly all their transactions are processed through it.
4. So, if RobinHood does well, then SOFI should do equally well. HOOD is valued at 45 Billion, while SOFI is way undervalued at 13 Billion. With higher annual revenue and growth, SOFI should be near 25 Billion in my opinion; once people learn more about the company.
5. A friend of a friend who knows a friend that works at the company who’s also my friend, says they are actively working on options trading platform.
6. Bank charter status:  this is jet fuel to SOFI’s business allowing them to out compete and out tech anyone.  Expected by end of year or early next. Just a matter of time.
7. Cathie Wood will likely add SOFI to ARKK or ARKF in the near future. We know how much she loves SQ. SOFI should fit her funds perfectly; both high tech and high growth.  SoftBank is already a major investor in SOFI.
8. Stock took a beating past couple months due to lock up expiration. By now, those who wanted to sell already sold. Only way is up.

The shorts have taken pretty outrageous positions.  At last check they were over 28% of float and rising.

I predict we are seeing the begining of a Covid-19 infection wave in the USA that will be even bigger than last fall/winter. 3 months ago Delta variant was not even 10% of the cases in America, but now it accounts for 83.4% of all cases. 


All the signs I am seeing tell me we are poised to overwhelm our hospitals even sooner than we almost did in many parts of the country last fall/winter.

This will all create massive pressure for the USA government to expedite funding and remove roadblocks to the EUA of 2nd generation vaccine technology, new Covid-19 antivirals, Covid-19 treatments, and repurposed medications that also assist in reducing the severity of Covid-19, but especially hospitalization and death. 

Let me break down what I am seeing: 

Pandemic fatigue is everywhere. People, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, want to return and maintain a sense of normalcy. Most people are not taking any precautions. They think they are vaccinated so the pandemic is over for them.

This pandemic fatigue is perfectly expressed by governors in right leaning states that have taken swift action against schools imposing mask mandates, and have even gone so far as to threaten to cut funding if they do impose masks upon students. These governors never want to repeat 2020 again and they feel the people that would re-elect them feel the same. Specifically Arkansas, Arizona, Iowa, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah have banned mask mandates. Unfortunately, many of these states have the highest number of unvaccinated teenagers so they are at greater risk for catching and spreading Covid-19 amongst themselves and even among the vaccinated.

Unfortunately, physicians are seeing more and more young people filling up their hospital beds. For example, Arkansas reported today that they only have 8 ICU beds left in the entire state. Yes, just 8.

A Children's Hospital in Florida recently reported they were at 116% capacity. 

We are heading into schools re-opening and starting in late September the cooling of the weather will see more people spending increasingly more time inside, which will greatly increases the risk for transmission. Plainly states without masks in many schools we can expect the infection rate to exponentially accelerate across many parts of the United States.

While children have no pratical protection against COVID-19, except for masks and social distancing, vaccinated adults are not entirely out of the woods either.

Pfizer's CEO recently reported that vaccine effectiveness drops to around 84% after 4-6 months. Research suggests that effectiveness will drop up to 6% every 2 months. Israel, which is exclusively using Pfizer's vaccine, reports it is only 39% effective at preventing infection, however, it is 88% effective at preventing hospitalization. This may not remain true as immunity continues to drop as Israel races to implement a third booster shot. 

But more concerning Israel has reported that Lambda variant is showing that three mutations on its spike make it 150% more resistant to antibodies produced by the vaccine. In plain English this means, it is 1.5X more effective at infecting a fully vaccinated person. The more people that get infected the more people will end up in hospitals.

Lambda variant is present in 44 states now. Japanese researchers believe under certain conditions that Lambda may spread faster than Delta variant. It is the main variant in South America and some researchers think it may become the dominant variant in America in a matter of months, based on how quickly it spread in South America.

Moreover, the first among that were vaccinated are now experiencing facing reduced vaccine effectiveness as Delta is surging and poised to continue to surge. In December 2020 Phase 1A prioritized the vaccination of healthcare personnel and long-term care facilities (aka generally very old people). Due to low vaccine supply and early snags in vaccine logistics many of the people on phase 1A received their 1st vaccine sometime between December and January with most having finished their 2nd dose in January or February. As I see it phase 1A all have hit their 6 month mark in August....as in right now. The other phases of those who reciever vaccine priority will start to lose even vaccine efficacy in September-December, the veey months that are looking like they are going to be worse than their 2021 counterparts.

Compounding the strong likelihood for even more cases of Covid-19 and increased hospitalization are those who decline to be vaccinated with the J&amp;J, Moderna, or Pfizer vaccines. Many employers are mandating by September-October timeframe or sooner that all of their employees get vaccinated. 

Prediction: People that refuse to work for a company that requires vaccination will find work in companies that do not require vaccination. 

Literally, in the next few months we will see a shifting of the workforce as the unvaccinated begin to congregate in workplaces that are conducive with their decision to not become vaccinated. Already my work has lost 1% of it workforce since announcing just 7 days ago that there will be mandatory vaccination completed by mid September. Based on conversations with key in-the-know people at work we will see many more people leave in the next few weeks. I expect upwards of 10% will leave. Your company could be seeing the same effect if vaccines are mandated. Most people that are unvaccinated in America are so not from a lack of opportunity, but by choice. I agree many will comply and become vaccinated as they are told by their employers, ""Resistance is futile, you will be vaccinated"" to avoid losing their jobs. However, a late 2020 study out of Germany indicated as many as 30% of people would refuse mandatory vaccination.  A December 2020 US study suggested that in many parts of the US a majority of people did not support employee-enforced vaccine mandates.

Now what will these unvaccinated people do? Will they seek work or live off government assistance? There is a strong link between people that are unwilling to become vaccinated and the likelihood they belong to a political affiliation that greatly reduces their willingness to receive government assistance. Accordingly, they will seek non-mandatory vaccine workplaces to continue to provide for their necessities of life.

It is also fair to assume that many of these anti mandatory vaccine businesses will not enforce mask rules or social distancing. It is doubtful they have invested in improved ventilation or air filtration which are two approaches validated by MIT researchers as essential to reducing the spread of COVID-19. An extreme example of this anti-vaccine mentality can be found in a Missouri taxi service that banned vaccinated or masked riders.

Now, non-vaccinated clientele and employees will begin to increasing gravitate  to these types of businesses (out of necessity) they are going to create the perfect opportunity for repeated outbreak opportunities (and greater possibilities for the introduction of new and possibly more infectious variants) that will lead to even more cases and even greater hospitalizations. 
And all of this is lining up for the fall when we increasingly are inclined to spend more time inside.

As you can see I am clearly predicting a dire fall and winter ahead. I don't think the stock market is realizing how bad this actually is going to be in America and other parts of the world. When the hospitals get close to getting overwhelmed, governments will be forced to institute another round of lockdowns. Again, because of pandemic fatigue they will resist until the absolute last moment to institute lockdowns, but they are coming. I predict by Thanksgiving. 

The market is in for a shock this fall/winter as politicians will likely surprise investors by resisting shutdowns until the very last minute. Accordingly, I have purchase VXX calls and Spy puts. 

But let's you think, this guy is all doom and gloom I have tremendous hope for the future that in a mere 6-12 months we will develop the rights vaccines, the right antiviral drugs, the right treatments and discover the right existing drugs to absolutely crush Covid-19. We will conquer it and there are several publicly traded companies that I have identified that I think may paly a huge role in saving lives and ending this pandemic.

Here is my write-up on $AVIR: 

Dr. Fauci has mentioned the company and drug by name several times, which means it is definitely on his radar. AVIR has already received government funding, which means it is on the US government's nice list. Roche has established a partnership with them based on phase 2 data and provided AVIR with around 322M in cash because their phase 2 data was so positive. By day 2 of treatment 80% of baseline viral load was reduced! They had a positive EPS of 34 cents last quarter. AVIR is a clear winner that is poised to become a leader in antivirals and may be an excellent acquisition target. Phase 3 results for their oral antiviral pill should be ready by end of year. 

There is a low share count of 92M authorized shares and they currently have a tremendous 833M cash on hand to fund their pipeline.


Disclosures: I am not a financial advisor, tax advisor, or a medical advisor/expert. I have provided this for entertainment purposes only. I own shares and calls options for AVIR.

So let me begin with some TA or as I like to call it SA (Stonk Astrology) 

[$AAPL 1 day 2 year chart](

&amp;#x200B;

[$AAPL 1 hour 30 day chart](

&amp;#x200B;

 What am I looking at? You might be asking and that's a decent question. So let me explain first starting with the 1 day/ 2 year chart. This chart I'm using to show that Apple tends to have its run ups preceding earnings. On that note if you have ever been wondering why you always get IV crushed at earnings its because Apple is so reliably profitable and has grown so consistently throughout its life span that Wall Street tends to price in that Apple will meet or exceed expectations well before they actually announce. This tends to be the pattern for most of the mega cap stocks that are highly globalized and have monopolistic tendencies. (think: MSFT AMZN GOOGL probably). 

 This second graph is the more important one as it actually shows actionable data. If you direct your goldfish-like attention to the 1 hour 30 day chart you can take a look at some things that I have laid out. 

1.)  The orange lines: they form a triangle if you didn't notice that than you definitely shouldn't be trading stocks, but if you have gotten far enough to identify a triangle than you can probably handle the idea of a breakout. As these triangles form they general lead to a breakout from the triangle formation and on to higher, highs or lower, lows. that's it, not that hard to understand

2.) Purple Lines: Just a trace of the prices to better visualize the patterns forming 

3.) Blue Lines: Simple moving avg I set my 3 moving avgs. to 20, 50, and 200, When the cross or spread out  they can help identify downturns or breakouts respesctively. 

4.) Red Lines: this is a fib retracement which uses the fib. sequence to help identify support and resistance levels between the highs and lows of and stock and beyond. The fib. retractions are the most difficult to explain because simply put I literally have no idea why prices using fib. levels as support and resistance. That being said, my research indicated to me that no one else could really explain it either, whether or not prices actually act this way or since everyone uses fib sequences that we cause price to act that way. Either way I have found these work really well when Identifying support and resistance. 

 Studies: I'm just going to clump these into to the same category but these are the charts that you seen on the bottom first one is volume, second one is the ATR which is relative volatility, and MACD which helps indicate refeversals and RSI which helps identify overbought and oversold conditions 

 The trade: so what this chart is telling me is that $AAPL has been consolidating for some months and could break out to new highs. What I am going to do is buy the oct 15 $155 call or the sept 17 $155 call if you are feeling confident like me. Something important I forgot to mention above is that $AAPL's implied volatility is not only historically low but also below the historical one year avg. What this means is that not only will your call option increase in value due to the run up in price but the run up IV that is likely to happen will compound your gains. Why is this likely to happen simply the law of averages? 

&amp;#x200B;

[$AAPL IV vs. historical IV ](

 Couple of notes: first I am not a financial advisor just a dude with a hobby, second obviously TA is a good look into what has happened historically it doesn't guarantee that it will happen. That being said, if this TA begins to bring down I would look at the $143.50 level as confirmation and as for confirmation on the upside you should look for the previous high of $150. To make this trade successful you might want to consider staggering your buys instead of the traditional balls deep all at once. For an example I have already entered this trade with 10 shares at an avg. of $147 and a sep. 17 $155 call at the same price. I plan to buy more 155 calls for both sept and oct. as the price drifts up to $150 if all goes to plan I am looking at a pt of around $160 

TLDR: I thing this is the begining of the apples run up before q3 earnings sep 17 $155 calls

A few years ago, 99% of dentist were against smile direct, primarily because we did not know anything about the structure of how they work. All we knew was that someone was moving patients teeth without our authorization or pre-approval.

As time has passed, many dentists including myself has opened our eyes and gained a lot of knowledge about what exactly smile direct does.   They move teeth that are in the mild/moderate cases.  Which means that severe cases would still need traditional braces.  
That is totally fine by me. If a patient comes to my office with a slightly curved front tooth, then why would I not want to save her $5-6000 (the cost of Invisalign) when she can get that corrected easily with smile direct ($1900).
It’s ethically wrong of me not to offer this to my patients, and greed does not belong in healthcare!

Now let’s proceed to the continuous negative sentiment from my fellow dental-colleagues.   Orthodontics is a VERY exclusive private sector which has for 100 years kept their work for themselves and even during dental school they did not want to teach general dentists much about it.   So you can imagine the threat they felt when they suddenly see that a company is eating off their plate. (Loss of $income!).    They have gone full force against smiledirect in all ways possible, including legally!   Smile direct club has so far won every single legal case brought against them, with the most recent one being against the dental boards of Georgia.

It’s important to understand that many dentist will claim that it’s “unsupervised”, which I can tell you first hand it is not. When patients come to my clinic, I do a full exam, including cavity and periodontally clearing my patients before possibly referring them to SDC. 
Now, If patients decide to go directly to a smile shop (and not through a dentist), then they would fill out paperwork where they are clearly asked if they have seen a dentist and been cleared. If patient is self neglective and chooses to lie then clearly the only one doing harm to themselves here is the patient, and not SDC. 

Let’s continue my thoughts about the stock;  the stock with an IPO of $22 in 2019 has been slammed by short sellers (many suspecting Invisalign competitor being a big part of it). Currently there is a 28% short interest in sdc! That is huge when it comes to a potential short squeeze.   

Smile direct have focused on growth and expansion, so all of their income has gone back in to their business. So they have not even attempted to show profitability, since growth has been priority.
In January of 2020, invisalign lost their patent to work directly with dentists in dental offices, so SDC are now growing their partnerships with dental offices directly at a high pace!  In their most recent earnings they said they are signed up with 1,800 DSO dental offices. Which is huge!
See link of Invisalign patent expiration below; 


Furthermore, smile direct has signed an exclusive partnership with Walmart to sell their products in their stores. Now also in CVS stores.

Smile direct has recently also focused on international expansion which includes US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Mexico, Austria, Spain, Netherlands, Hong Kong and Singapore.

For everyone else, it’s time to start traveling without moving. Part I concerns CEO moves, and Part II involves some good old fashion geopolitical conspiracy talk. 

Part I – BB’s CEO is Ready

John Chen, the CEO of BB, is scheduled to present at a JP Morgan Auto Investor Conference on 8/11 at 3:30pm. [

So what? JC does not fuck around with bullshit. He has never presented at an investor conference, but now he’s so sure of his auto products that he’s ready to do heavy promotion. Believe me, JC is confident that profits are coming. On the day of Lyft’s IPO, JC was interviewed and stated, “Profits are important. Investors will eventually come back and want to know about the return.” [

John Chen is not going to go hype something that’s not a sureshot.  He’s 66 and highly accomplished. He will not throwaway his reputation shilling for something that is speculative. BB’s CEO has always been positive about his company, but actively recruiting investors for the first time at a conference is a significant change for JC.  In fact, the timing of his presentation appears calculated to make him look good, like someone that can move a stock. But how?

PART II – China Has the Autonomous Vehicle Lead, and BB is Essential to Catching Up

For all the people sweating under tinfoil right now, here’s that geopolitical conspiracy I promised. Baidu is going to release earnings before market on 8/12. The earnings will contain some real hype on the Level 4 autonomous vehicles (Robotaxis and Minibuses) that the public can use right now. The CCP is going to boast about these vehicles from now through the Beijing Winter Olympics in six months. These Level 4 vehicles, without steering wheels, are too big to fail for the CCP.  It’s gonna fuckin work.  BB’s QNX is the OS for these vehicles.

BB and AWS are now promoting IVY as a means of safely and quickly extracting data and making updates to vehicles on the road.  IVY is the key to speeding up autonomous vehicle development.  Here’s the promo piece that AWS is now paying to run in the WSJ: [

Conclusion:

Starting on 8/12, there may be a BB pump related to Baidu’s earnings report. John Chen is going to get the credit for BB’s 8/12 movement due to having given a presentation on 8/11. The presentation may also have market moving news for BB.  This quick play might work, but the real moonshot probably occurs over the next few years, when the profits actually come in.

1) 130 years old Merck and 172 years old Pfizer could not make mRNA vaccine. Pfizer is marketing German BioNTech's vaccine. PFE did not invent it.
2) Moderna can not be assessed on age-old fundamentals. The same way Apple, Amazon, Tesla because their valuation is way over.
3) Insulin has increased more than 1200% since it was invented.
4) Gilead Sciences Sets US Price for COVID-19 Drug at $2340 to $3120
5) Gilead Sciences Sovaldi, a drug that can cure Hepatitis C in 90 days when used in combination with other antiviral drugs. The initial price was more than $1,000 per day, and the total cost of treatment could exceed $80,000
6) Moderna has only 1 product to sell. Which happens to be in the middle of a pandemic. Moderna was awarded some funding and it is keeping its prices down for Covid vaccines.
7) Moderna does not need to keep its prices down for future products since it will not meet with a similar pandemic.
8) Moderna has developed 100 proteins in the last 10 years but did not have enough funding to continue with the product R&amp;D.
9) Now Moderna has the cash and can spend money for R&amp;D so it can release many products in the years to come

Now how would you compare the company valuation when there are so many factors in play?
BofA’s Geoff Meacham said to compare its last 4 successful quarters – Moderna started selling its only product i.e. Covid vaccine from last Dec in the middle of the pandemic.

The insulin &amp; Gilead was added for comparison that Moderna would not need to cap its future product price(Covid vaccine price is capped due to small government funding &amp; Pandemic) and therefore will not need to sell many doses to make up the revenue

I'm Moist Lunch - the best kind of lunch! - and you might remember me from other popular TnA threads like AMD DDs and... well... I've only ever done one, so there you go.

In that TA post, I described the AMD cup and handle formation and predicted the 20+ point run-up which we so thoroughly enjoyed these past few weeks. Having said that, maybe we haven't all so thoroughly enjoyed its sudden but inevitable betrayal!... I mean run-down.

Of course, anyone following AMD knew it was going to come down at some point... because it's $AMD. So the question on everyone's mind is... when's it rocketing again? Come on Glorious Leader Su, you know we love you!

So I hit the charts again and have some findings.

# TL;DR: Predictions

Not to be a stock tease, but unlike the last TA where the cup and handle formation provided some data to give a solid price target, what we have right now is not worthy of a price target. We're in no-mans land at the moment for the stock, but we do have some indicators suggesting that a trend reversal may be in the making either right now or soon.

I decided to make this post because the charts have, today, finally given up some indication of a change in trend, and I want to share this information with you so that you have something to think about in deciding when to get back into the stock.

My overall guess from the chart trending today (and this is not a prediction and you should definitely NOT trade based on this guess) is that the current bottom is 105, and that it will either rebound from here, or rebound and then take another trip down to test 100. If it break below 105, I believe there's a better than average chance it will retest 101 and then probably drop into the high 90s, based on the Fibonacci retracement.

\*\*\* I am not a professional and this is not financial advice. I am just sharing this analysis because I found the data interesting! If you buy anything based in this data, anything could happen up to and including your spontaneous combustion or a hole may be ripped in the space-time continuum, sucking everything into the magical unicorn buttplug universe. You are forewarned, and probably heavily perforated. \*\*\*

# The TnA, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Waking Up In A Cold Sweat Wondering If I Lost my Life Savings

&amp;#x200B;

**Overall trending considerations**

&amp;#x200B;

[AMD 08-10-2021 Trends, MACD, RSI, and EMAs](

&amp;#x200B;

I've included a shot above of the 1 month chart for AMD. I believe the 1 month to be the best trending representation right now because it encompasses the entire current trend. Others have different methods and I'm still (and always will be) learning so if you have a different view of things, please let me know. All readings are at 30 minute intervals.

Obviously after earnings, we saw an amazing run-up of well over 30 points from the bottom of about 86. The high was short-lived, and if some of us blinked, we probably missed or slept through it. Now we've seen a predictable decline, the sum of which seems to match a rough Elliott Wave pattern. I have to be honest, I don't put a lot of stock into Elliott Waves as predictive patterns and has seen them give way more than a few times since I started doing TA (which has not been very long). Having said that, AMD is adhering pretty closely to standard algorithmic trading patterns (more on that in a bit) so there's some reason to believe there's relevance here. I began thinking about this last night and when the run today intersected with the yellow trendline, it confirmed that there may be something to this thought.

The MACD indicator tells a similar tale, with a cross over the signal line. It also has the first run of consistent buy pressure that we've seen since the peak. I view this trend as weak at the moment, rather than decisive, so take it with a grain of salt.

Similarly the monthly chart RSI shows that we're bottoming out and may be oversold. I also consider this to be a weak signal, but one which indicates that there's reversal potential. I'm looking for this to migrate back up to the middle in the next couple of days, but if it continues to trend down I think we're looking at more sell-off acceleration, and that's when we need to think about it potentially dipping down below the 105-100 range.

&amp;#x200B;

**VWAP trends**

&amp;#x200B;

[AMD 08-10-2021bars VWAP](

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the VWAP trend for the current run. I've chosen to use bars representation here because they better show the trending of trades within the weighted average. As you can see during the run-up period trades regularly trended in the higher VWAP range, and during the run-down they trended lower. What caught my eye today was that they again began trending more heavily in the higher end of the VWAP range.

This corresponds heavily and is basically the same metric as the MACD above. This is a pretty weak signal, but taken with the other signals it suggests a potential change in trending direction for AMD to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Moving Average and Support Line (FIB) trends**

&amp;#x200B;

[AMD 08-10-2021bars EMA 8 &amp; 21 + volume profile](

In this graph, with a lot of the noise reduced, you can better see the relationship between the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) 8 (blue line) and EMA 21 (red line). What we're looking for here is a strong cross of the blue line up into the red line so that it's above, indicating a stock price support point. The tightening here indicates that we're not quite done with the downtrend yet, but that we may be approaching a point where the tightening of price dynamics produces a stronger support trend and eventually, if volume can remain elevated, a stronger buying trend.

I've included the volume profile indicator here even though it's somewhat questionable because it correlates strongly with both the established support level from today and the Fibonacci sequence support position 0.5... and the line of control (yellow line) also strongly correlates with a significant point of support during the run-up. Take this with a major grain of salt because the run-up data may tilt the output of the indicator, but its strong correlation is worth noting.

Speaking of Fibonacci sequences, and this one shouts at me in the dark, we bounced right off the 0.5 today:

&amp;#x200B;

[AMD 08-10-2021Fibonacci Retracement](

This was a little too abrupt to just ignore for me. That's a pretty stark bounce off the line and there's a matching bounce at the 0.382 previously. The high on 8/6 is REALLY close to the 0.236 point.

You can also see extraordinary correlation with the FIB sequence in the run-up as well.

Will we test the $109 price point (probably closer to $110) again? Or will the stock test $105 again and try to break down to $100 or beyond? I'm not sure because the current trend is weak, but to me I expect there to be strong support in the $105 position based on this data, and this looks like a consolidation around $107 at the moment.

# Reasons for Concern

**Volume**

Volume is still insanely high for the stock, with much of it being sell volume recently, but the current volume trends are declining, particularly relative to the NASDAQ:

&amp;#x200B;

[AMD 08-10-2021 volume trends](

During the run-up, volume strongly correlated with NASDAQ volume (not surprising since it was a top trading stock) but since then has really slipped and the price decline matches a volume decline. The On-balance volume decline is concerning and unless the volume trend reverses, we're likely to see more decline. Further decline will feed profit-taking desires and panic sells and that's when we start testing back into the 90s, I think. Having said that, we're not there yet, and volume is still relatively elevated.

Also, while the indicators suggest a reversal trend, they're weak and don't indicate any kind of price targets. What we're looking for here is a continuation and an expansion of the trend and a tightening of the EMAs, along with increase in RSI and higher correlated buy volume. If those trends continue, I think we could easily retest up to 120 within the next two weeks, but I will be hedging and setting stoploss sells to my risk appetite until the sell trend completely resolves. I won't really be happy until that EMA cross occurs, because until that does this trend could keep going down.

**Positions**

I sold most of my calls during the run-up, but am currently holding the following positions:

Sorry for the wall of text - but if you are serious about trading **please read through this -** I think you all could really benefit from a bit of intermarket analysis - and I see way too many victims of ignorance here who could prevent their losses by understanding these relatively simply concepts.

This sub is primarily focused on IWM names (Russell 2000/Small Caps). If you look at that stock - **it's been sideways for almost a year**. No secret you all have been losing tons of money as of late on your favorite names (Except MVST - nice one there).

In my eyes - for the best probability of success - you always want to be playing the names that are within the strongest index at the time (or simply playing the strongest index itself). I determine which is the strongest via charting plus some simple intermarket relationships.

Last year during the recovery we got a huge **everything rally** \- that is not usually the case. Money constantly rotates from sector to sector - this is how it usually is - and how it's been for most of 2021. For instance - notice today (8/102021) tech is dropping while financials, materials and other inflation camp names are pumping. This is one of many useful correlations.

# II. The Indices

The indices are large groups of stocks lumped in together that usually move in unison. Most of you probably already know this. I'm just going to list out what each index is and what it focuses on.

**S&amp;P 500 (SPY, SPX, ES)**

*from Wikipedia*

""The Standard and Poor's 500, or simply the S&amp;P 500, is a stock market index that tracks 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. It is one of the most commonly followed equity indices.""

Basically a compilation of most large caps in the United States. Great gage of overall market health - and sort of a cross between the other two large cap indexes (Nasdaq 100, Dow Jones).

**Nasdaq 100 (QQQ, NDX, NQ)**

*from Wikipedia*

""The Nasdaq-100 is a stock market index made up of 102 equity securities issued by 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock market. It is a modified capitalization-weighted index. ""

These are going to be mostly your large cap growth names (tech stocks) - but there are a few boomer names in there. Just more heavy on the growth side than the other indexes.

**Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA, DJIA, YM)**

*from Wikipedia*

""The Dow Jones Industrial Average, Dow Jones, or simply the Dow, is a price-weighted measurement stock market index of 30 prominent companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States.""

These are going to be your ""boomer"" names - I like to call it the boomer index. Value, materials, healthcare etc. Not really any growth names in there (except AAPL, CRM I guess). One thing I like to note is that **all the names in Dow Jones are present in the S&amp;P 500 - the Dow is the most closely correlated index to the S&amp;P** (about a 0.92 correlation iirc).

**Russell 2000 Index (IWM, RUT, RTY)**

*from Wikipedia*

""The Russell 2000 Index is a small-cap stock market index of the smallest 2,000 stocks in the Russell 3000 Index. It was started by the Frank Russell Company in 1984. The index is maintained by FTSE Russell, a subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange Group.""

These are all your small cap names. There is also a Russell 1000 and Russell 3000. Notice how many more companies are in here than the other indexes. This one isn't going to be moved by one or two stocks. Small caps usually benefit from risk on environments (they are perceived to be riskier) - but note the more speculative growth ones will lag in those situations.

These are also **meme stocks - pretty much every single one is in a Russell Index.** If you are someone who likes to play memes - you always want to watch IWM. When this one is popping off is when they will be making a run.

# III. Risk On vs Risk Off (Inflation vs Deflation Camp)

Moving onto more practical applications of this information. I could do a section on Forex, Bonds, etc. - but honestly you only need to know what they are to apply the analysis that I do.

The primary narrative driving the market in recent times is whether we are getting inflation or deflation - and this has dictated the flow of money.

**Risk On (Inflation Camp)**

Risk-On is described as a rotation from save haven assets into riskier assets. If market participants believe in high inflationary pressures, they will want to invest their cash into **""risk"" assets** including, stocks, real estate etc. to combat the residual effects of inflation on their money. Additionally, they believe we are now in a rising rate environment (rates already at zero, likely to increase in the future), which would help benefit **value stocks, financials/banks, energy, specific forex/currencies**, anything that benefits from low rates (currently).

More specifically, **banks benefit from a gradual steady increase in interest rates.** Banks make an interest rate spread on deposits received versus money lent. In a rising rate environment, they are able to pay lower interest on their deposits and make a larger spread on their loans.

Commodities, materials (energy), and consumer/defensive stocks **benefit from inflation** as they are able to pass on rising costs to consumers. Additionally, value/defensive stocks typically have a strong track-record of recurring dividends and share buybacks to provide yield to shareholders. Conversely, in later stages of rising rates, investors may divest from growth or tech stocks because rising rates have a direct effect on liquidity and cost of capital. **When rates are high, debt is heavier and money is more expensive.**

AUD/JPY is an easy forex pair to watch for risk on movements based on the Australian economy in relation to Japan. A**UD is seen as a ""risk"" currency**, whereas **JPY is seen as a ""safe haven""**. When AUDJPY is increasing, typically this is a sign of ""risk-on"". This is only one of many pairs to watch for in Forex Markets, considering Forex Markets are much larger than the stock market.

Remember, in the early stages of inflation, small caps or tech stocks will perform well because the negative impact of inflation on sitting in cash; however, if the federal reserve is required to combat hyper/stagflation worries, they will raise rates and growth or tech stocks may perform poorly in that environment. Furthermore, **Dow Jones Industrial Average (boomer)** names will usually outperform, and investors today may be pricing-in this effect.

Equities as a whole will generally do well in a risk-on environment. Stocks are considered a hedge for inflation, but watch-out for JPOW and his antics later on.

**Risk Off (Deflation Camp)**

This is the opposite of risk-on. Money rotates out of risk assets into safe havens. People in the deflation corner believe inflation is transitory, asset prices will decline, and virtually **assume the Federal Reserve won't have to raise rates**. In low inflation or deflationary environment, money flows **to safe haven assets out of risk assets**. Participants would hoard cash (increasing in value) and wait for asset prices to decline. They would invest in **bonds, safe haven currencies, speculate on an increase in volatility, and save cash to reinvest later.**

In recent times - growth performs well here because when interest rates are low - money is cheaper to borrow. **Growth depends on debt to continue it's operations. Most of them also don't make money and so they have** **no yield.**  An increase in interest rates will raise the cost of capital making it harder for companies to generate higher returns. With rising rates, a company has to pay a higher interest expense that lowers their overall profitability. Lower profits lead to lower cash flows, which lead to a higher required rate of return for investors, all of which lead to a lower valuation for the company's share price. Note this is primarily due to recent macroeconomic events - and in the past all equities have been considered risk on.

Bonds outperform because investors believe rates to remain low or fall further. They'd be able to receive a **""higher"" interest rate today versus in the future.** Bonds are typically safer than equity because they are first in-line in the event of a liquidation (bankruptcy) and earn a fixed rate of return. Additionally, the **USD, JPY, CHF** perform well because they are a 'safe-haven' currency. The US Dollar is still considered the world's reserve currency. (Trust in the US Economy/Risk Free) In addition, deflation has a natural increase in the dollar's value.

The VIX performs well because it's **essentially a measure of how hedged SPX players are**. If you are expecting deflation in assets - you are expecting prices to drop for the most part - and so you want to be hedged on your long positions (or make straight bear bets).

**In Summary**

Today, the Federal Reserve has created a low interest rate environment to stimulate the economy; through allowing participants to borrow funds ""cheaper"" or lower rates. This stimulates demand, supply, borrowing, lending... overall growth. Asset prices are attempting to ""price-in"" the future state of the economy.

If you believe that inflation is here to stay, then you'd want to shift into risk-assets. If you believe that inflation is 'transitory', then you'd want to move towards safe haven assets. Ultimately, you could assume that the Federal Reserve controls the narrative and that any major movements in the flow of money, cost of debt (change in rates), could have a positive or negative impact on asset prices. In either scenario (in the future), inflation can lead to higher interest rates causing a drop in asset prices or deflation worries can keep interest rates low and fuel the rally for longer than one would expect. I hope that makes sense.

Glancing at a watchlist of these will give you a quick picture of where money is flowing at the moment - but in order to predict the odds of future movements (and more profitable ones) - I perform technical analysis on all of these names.

Basically - I analyze all the indices and only play the one that is the strongest from a technical standpoint. I further filter these signals and determine position sizing by analyzing their correlated assets.

For instance - if **DIA** is breaking out - and **ZB** is breaking down - this is confluence for a risk on rotation. The more confluence - the higher probability you have of success in any play.

On the contrary, if **DIA** is breaking out - and **ZB** is rallying - this is a sign one of the moves is likely fake - and a signal I have lower odds of success. Subsequently, I want to size smaller.

***Let's take a look at one example in which QQQ (Growth, Risk Off) caught the rotation this past May. This is a perfect example of Bonds and Growth moving in unison to provide a high probability long trade in QQQ and TLT. Note: I just use trendlines and volume for my technical analysis. No indicators.***

QQQ - 

The red circle is Nasdaq on **5/13.** You can see that is the day it bottomed - and every day since then pretty much Nasdaq and Growth assets have been leading. Not only that - but on **6/22** it broke a huge technical setup (the big red line) - which triggered a ton more upside.

TLT - 

The red circle here is also **5/13.** You can see that is also the day that TLT (ZB or Bonds) bottomed - and every day since then except for the past three days - it's held the same uptrend. Not only that - but on **6/22** it also broke that big red line - which was a downtrend stemming from last year - triggering more upside here as well. We also broke out of that teal symmetrical triangle, which provided more confluence for the move.

I try to assign a signal strength to each move in order to make it easier for my monkey brain to understand.

* **Indexes:** 3
* **Bonds:** 2
* **Everything Else:** 1

You will see a lot of people say bonds are everything - and in my experience that is very true. Last year we had an extremely odd situation where risk parity was fucked - but in recent times it has come back. Correlations almost always revert to the mean at **some point**. Subsequently - you could watch just bonds and the indices and efficiently track the flow of money.

# V. Divergences

Correlations are not perfect. If they were - everyone would be a billionaire. There are times when we get divergences and things move opposite of the way they usually do. Like I said - they **almost** **always revert to the mean** at some point - but the catch is the divergence could blow your account before it reverts back. If you are good with technicals you can easily spot when a setup you are trying to play breaks down and stop loss accordingly - but the key point here is **always have a stop loss when playing correlations.** Lots of people think they can average down infinitely and eventually profit off the arbitrage that comes with assets reverting to the mean - but **the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.**

# IV. TL;DR

The main thing to takeaway here is the indices. If QQQ is weak - maybe you want to take a look at DIA. If IWM is sideways - maybe you want to take a look at QQQ. Keep your head on a swivel and don't be too biased towards one sector. **If you can effectively track the flow of money - you can theoretically catch every rotation.**

Also - you don't have to apply the technicals I do to track it. That's just my method. Lot's of people use complex macroeconomic analysis to assess these sorts of things, among other methods. I'm just too smooth brained for that.

I hope this helped you all - and if anyone has questions drop it in the comments.

\---

Edit: One final note since I know the more advanced people will likely comment on this. I know QQQ/Growth has not always been risk off - this is a new thing. I was trying to explain things from the perspective of recent times as correlations shift with macroeconomic changes.

We haven't had a true deflationary environment in over a decade - and subsequently the market rotations have been more about pricing in rate hikes/rate cuts than rotating in and out of equities as a whole.

RKT has burned many people in the past. To some it will always be the ex that hurt you, broke your favorite mixtapes you made just for her, and told your friends you had a small member. 

Hell I get that, but here is why I will continue to bet my money on RKT. I bet on what they are BECOMING. 

RKT is already MORE than a MORTGAGE company, but you wont here that from most ANALysts. 

ROCKET COMPANIES is currently profitable in three major markets. Mortgages, Home Searching(Rocket Homes), and now Rocket Auto. 

I believe this earnings will show the undeniable proof in the success of RKTs branching out. Auto was insanely profitable before it even fully launched in Q2. 

So a couple factors that scream bullish during the current market. 

HOMES sales are not at the record high but are still high, and RKT is now the Number 1 mortgage lender in the country. RKT is aggressively stealing market share from all competitors. With the addition of Rocket Homes they are now directly in competition with zillow. RKT is profitable in every industry they touch. 

Rocket Auto, with this expansion in todays current used vehicle market this is a no brainer. This expansion was profitable before it's actual full launch. 

And finally one that many people are not talking about, Solar. 

RKT will be entering the Solar energy market to offer refinancing packages for customers to take advantage of the Solar energy tax credits and help facilitate and manage installation of solar to homes. 

What makes me the most bullish on RKT is the billions in profit they make every quarter, and the cash and shares on hand they keep for the NEXT BIG IDEA or acquisition.

Everything RKT has dipped its toes into has made them money. 

The last thing that screams out putting my money on the Red Rocket, everyone is telling you its doomed. The ANALysts are screaming SELL, the media is saying doomed, and every bank that they have already beat for the number one spot says it's going down. Everyone that Rocket has stolen market share from screams from the rooftops that they are ONLY a mortgage company.  This stock is so undervalued it makes me sick, excited, and slightly aroused. 

This is a FinTech Stock, and it deserves FinTech recognition. That's why I continue to bet on RKT, because the day rocket gets its deserved valuation will be a week to late. 

I would love to hear anyone's counter argument.

Position 126 Calls for 8/20. 75 for 19.50c, and  51 for 30c. It that's gets lost I'll continue to buy more.

Edit - Holy smokes, thanks to u/Future-Dimension-937 for reminding me about Rockets acquisition of Finmo. The Fastest Growing Mortgage Origination platform in Canada. This will be finally shown on the books this earnings!

Update edit! RKT company with continued record revenues, and home originations. Currently sitting at a 90 percent retention rate. Margins grew, sales grew. On track to even beat 2020 records. RKT HOMES made 2 Bil in revenue, RKT auto that's not even full launched made 400 million even with the constraints of limited inventory. Was up to a high of 19.15 AH and has settled at 18.50. 

Julie Booth CFO announced they have 7 billion on hand capital with over 4 to 5 billion for Dividends and continued Share Buy Backs. 

RKT will confirm Buybacks from last quarter in tomorrow's filing. 

I'm jacked to the TITs, do what you want but I'll be printing tomorrow.

Update #2 RKTs Quarter Filings show a Buy Back of 496,829 Shares for 8,312,921 between 5/1/21 and 5/31/21. Notably this was when RKT fell to a low of 16.55ish.
RKT has 991.7 million left of the Board Approved One Billion. RKT CFO Julie Booth mentioned multiple times in the Conference Call that they believed RKT is Massively Undervalued.

With the Earnings showing record revenue, Guidance on track, Great progress on RKT AUTO, RKT HOMES, Market Share gained, and 4 Billion on hand capital I believe RKT has more ammo than ever before. 

RKT Filings for anyone Interested.

&gt;Jefferies analyst Randal Konik said that while the third-quarter guidance may appear low, he believes management’s call reflects supply-chain troubles rather than problems with demand. Konik raised his target for the stock price to $49 from $45, implying a potential gain of 55%.

Callaway Golf has entered a new chapter after merging with Topgolf earlier this year, combining its equipment business with a recreation and hospitality segment. Preliminary results suggest that the combination has some untapped potential.

The company, which announced earnings after the close of trading on Monday, crushed expectations for its second-quarter profits. Non-GAAP per-share earnings came in at 36 cents, while analysts had expected just a penny. Revenue came in at $914 million, topping analyst expectations for $755 million.

Driven by a 91% increase in golf-equipment sales compared with the corresponding period last year, Callaway (ticker: ELY) notched a 97% year-over-year increase in revenue across all of its business lines except for Topgolf, the recreation and hospitality company it acquired earlier this year. 

Revenue and earnings were both outsize even compared with the same quarter in 2019, before the economic uncertainty stirred up by the pandemic briefly slashed spending on luxury goods. Excluding sales at Topgolf, the company reported revenue of $588 million, up from $447 million in the same quarter of 2019.

While the Topgolf business segment, which accounts for 36% of revenue, posted solid numbers, management reported that same-venue sales are still recovering and currently are around 90% of the 2019 level.

CEO Chip Brewer told investors Callaway is confident about the long-term outlook. “While in the short term we will experience some lingering supply constraints and other challenges caused by the pandemic, we believe that these challenges will be manageable given current demand levels and actions we are taking to mitigate the impact,” he said.

For the current quarter, management is expecting revenue to come in between $775 million and $790 million. That would be less than the $914 million for the most recent quarter, but Brewer said on a call to discuss the results with investors that seasonal factors mean the second quarter is generally stronger than the third.

For the full year, management expects around $3.0 billion in consolidated revenue, substantially more than the $1.7 billion in revenue generated in 2019.

From the guy that sold his HIMX for a loss after the election, and his AMC 2.5c in January for 100$ profit, and lost *bigly* on vaccine manufacturers with call dates that expired early, I present my OCGN gamble.

&amp;#x200B;



Ocugen bought the North American distribution rights to an Indian Vaccine - ""*Covaxin*"" made by Bharat Biotech.  It's a traditional vaccine in that it uses the tried and true whole-deactivated virus instead of the new mRNA technology and *Covaxin* has been [proven effective against the delta variant](

I originally gambled on the stonks because they have emergency use authorization [(EUA) in 10 countries]( (these 9 + Hungary) and thought the US FDA EUA approval would go... but no.  They were told no more EUAs being issued and go for full Biologics Application License.  Not gonna lie, that shit might take a year to get the full trials and paperwork vetted.  So, I've been bagholding the past couple months waiting on their other upcoming catalysts: Canadian EUA soon ^TM , the results of their 2-6 year old children's trial in September, AND the near (next week) WHO announcement on a EUA for the vaccine globally.

Its a gamble: WHO gives global approval to Bharat Biotech's *Coxavin,* that'll provide some serious legitimacy behind OCGN's Canadian EUA or even possibly lead to direct manufacturing for the global  COVAX distribution.  Coupled with the recent surge in Delta variant in the US, the FDA may even revisit an EUA for them...  but that's somewhere between maybe and using hopium as lube for a wishful gain-porn circle jerk.  It all comes down to WHO approval next week.

Flip the coin.

In this post we'll follow the same structure as previous posts. I'll do some hindsight porn examples. Show some real examples of me using the things explained in real time and then leave a forward looking example to test the theory.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll refer to stages in [Public Perceptions in Stages of an Asset Bubble]( I won't be quoting from there in full so read that for better context.  A fuller explanation of this post can [be found here.](

&amp;#x200B;

To keep this somewhat brief we'll split the sections of the trend rise and fail into bitesize chunks.

&amp;#x200B;

* Phase 1 -  Slow trend.  Up and down. Looks flat when viewed in the grander context later.
* Phase 2 - Structured trending breakout which starts to go parabolic later.
* Phase 3 - Early bear traps fucking over momentum chasers.
* Phase 4 - The boom and re-boom. Massive move that attracts attention to the asset.
* Phase 5 - The early instability of a trend.
* Phase 6 - The blow off high.
* Phase 7 - The first dump.
* Phase 8  - The bull trap
* Phase 9 - The crash

&amp;#x200B;

What I want to teach you through this post is when you understand these sections of the trend, you start to want to short into phase 5 onwards. The caricature of a bear is being a perma-bear and getting fucked over in the booming part of the trend -  but it's only after the trend displays late stage bubble properties that well researched bears start to come in.

&amp;#x200B;

Here this is in the DJI of 1929.



&amp;#x200B;

A fucking lot of people who have not looked at the crash of 1929 and now it relates to crashes of today tell me we can not use this to make forecasts on markets now.   But here this model is flagging up a useful time to short a certain popular asset that not many people expected to crash from 50 - 60K sort of area.



And [here you can find real time links to analysis and signals]( generated on this. You'll see all of the signals begin to form only into the latter end of the trend. From about 55K. The high will be 65K. There's the optimal retest entry on 60K and then the target is 31k  - the low of the move will be 29K.  I picked the low target using a 161 of the topping swing - [

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the bear porn version of this on the big SPX chart of today.



&amp;#x200B;

For my forward looking example, we'll use MRNA.  This has now extended about 300% above the bear trap high. This is typically where the boom and re-boom stage would end. It makes no fucking sense to short up until this is complete. Every time someone says, ""It would not have worked if you did it during the worst possible time"" - I fucking agree!

&amp;#x200B;



But once we've seen the boom and re-boom stage it makes a lot more sense to start to plan how you'd make bear trades if certain other things happen.

&amp;#x200B;

First we need to see the trend becoming unstable. Then we want to see a parabolic move high. Ideally we want to see this about 20 - 25% above the last high and that's the area in which we can look to short. Into this area we need about 10 - 20% space to find out if we're wrong. Take early stops and not be caught in a real serious uptrend.

&amp;#x200B;



If the trade works out and this has become a bubble move due to have a large correction, we're typically heading back to at least the bear trap (Usually a bit under)

Post 

Listen you money-hungry smooth-brained daddy dolphin fuckers - I’ve got something to say. Most of the stuff mentioned in WSB would traditionally fall within the analyst zone - not the financial Advisor or Planner zone. 

The DD and TA can be well researched and adhere more to research and analysis principals rather than traditional “Financial Advisor” services. 

I’m a CFP (in real life) and operate a financial services practice where I interface with individuals and businesses in order to make great financial decisions. 

When the WSB commenter scuttled out of the gutter to type with his crabby little claws “Not a financial advisor”, it doesn’t make sense. 

Financial advisors rarely or never conduct this type of research. We maintain great relationships with actual people and business. We help clients take what they have, add in the tax code and get to their goals - investments, retirement, insurance (life, disability other), annuities. Business succession planning can be one of the most profitable activities in a persons life. 

I know CFA’s, research analysts and portfolio managers who conduct research similar to that which WSB top contributors conduct and submit. It’s actually not similar - it’s the same. 

The WSB researchers who produce solid DD are in fact financial analysts. 

So - my main point is that WSB has shit DD sometimes and that’s not financial analysis. WSB has great research and DD sometimes and that IS true financial research and analysis. It’s based in the reality and usually has sources. 

“Not a financial advisor” correct - also not a pine cone - we all fucking know you are not a financial advisor.

“Not a financial analyst” and your DD is monkey gif based - probably. We assume if you were a financial analyst you would be working at a financial firm doing the exact same thing but posting the DD to a manager. 

“Not a financial analyst” - but you are actually submitting research - WRONG - you are a financial analyst. You fucking analyze finance for fun. If you wanted to get a job taking in the news and financial filings from public companies - you could. There aren’t always licenses needed to be a researcher. You don’t need to pass many tests to be on a research team. 

Stop flipping burgers and read up on how your passion for research could be a career.

ALRIGHT RETARDS. This is the only $SAVA DD you'll need to read to understand what's going on with Alzheimer's research. I broke it up into 3 parts so your tiny attention spans would be able to read it over time. This is the third part, the part i know you all care about: **Valuation.**

## TLDR:

1. I present an **extremely conservative** Discounted Cash Flow model of Simufilam sales (if successful) that values SAVA at **$18.91B or $472 per share**. This model only includes US sales until 2027.
2. SAVA was recently attacked by short selling, dishonest journalism, and unreasonable lawsuits. At current price ($96.04), it presents a buy opportunity. The CEO has hinted at a [major announcement]( in the near future.
3. I believe that SAVA is a daunting buyout opportunity and an attractive partnership opportunity. If a Big Pharma company were to buy SAVA, I believe the size of the buyout would need to be one of the largest ever, perhaps even larger than Gilead's [purchase]( of Immunomedics for $21B. Another way for SAVA shareholders to unlock the value of its research is in a licensing deal with a Big Pharma. In this case, we can expect the value of SAVA to continually grow into the $18B+ valuation I provided from US and global sales of Simufilam running to 2037.

# Valuation

Let's run a simple and conservative Discounted Cash Flow model for Simufilam sales in the next 7 years (assume 5 years of sales starting 2023):

|Year|2021|2022|2023|2024|2025|2026|2027|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Number of mild to moderate US AD patients|3,636,000|3,792,000|3,948,000|4,104,000|4,260,000|4,416,000|4,572,000|
|Market Penetration|0%|0%|10%|16%|22%|27%|33%|
|\# of US Patients Being Treated with Simufilam|0|0|394,800|649,800|923,000|1,214,400|1,524,000|
|Annual Cost of Drug|0|0|15000|15000|15000|15000|15000|
|Total Revenue from Simufilam|0|0|5.922B|9.747B|13.845B|18.216B|22.86B|
|50% Revenue [split](

Based on an extremely conservative **discount rate of 12%**, the net present value is **$18.91B.**

This simple model only looks at 5 years of sales and only 10% market penetration in the first year of sales. SAVA has patents on Simufilam [running till 2037]( Additionally, the model does not include global sales. Cassava Sciences at the current market cap of 3.86B is an asymmetric risk opportunity. At current valuation, the market gives SAVA a 20% chance of reaching this valuation. I believe this percentage **should be much higher**.

This analysis actually lines up decently well with another $660 price target i gave earlier based on a competitor, Biogen: 

**Phase 3 is de-risked by 9 month data results**. Simply put, as time passes and each of SAVA's trials progress and return positive data, the likelihood that Simufilam succeeds in Phase 3 increases (see Addendum). As the likelihood of success increases, the valuation of SAVA should also increase.

# Recent Price Manipulation

Here are some examples of inaccurate news coverage:

1. Cramer said SAVA was a sell because SAVA was [""trying to get people off opioids""](
2. Benzinga released an [article]( titled “Cassava Sciences Shares Fall Sharply Lower After STAT News Reports 'FDA calls for federal investigation into its controversial Alzheimer's drug approval'” Then, Benzinga revised their title to Cassava Sciences Shares Fall Sharply Lower After STAT News Reports 'FDA calls for federal investigation into \[Biogen's\] controversial Alzheimer's drug approval'
3. Stat News Article - Adam Feurerstein, a writer for Stat news with  known history for bashing biotech (take a look at what he said about Moderna: [Tweet History]( released this [article]( I wrote a [DD]( exposing major conflict of interest for all 3 scientists he quoted (who he has previously quoted as well).
4. Lawsuit Announcement by Pomerantz - After SAVA was shorted down from 146 to 73, this law firm, released a [PR]( claiming it is “investigating claims on behalf of investors” alleging possible securities fraud. The firm claims that Cassava’s PR was inappropriate because Cassava said its cognition data was positive (it is) but that Simufilam wasn’t proven to be more affective than Biogen’s Aduhelm (it was).

The CEO has even recently made remarks about the price action in a recent earnings call, responding to unfair criticism. You can read more [here](

**In my opinion**, SAVA is attracting so much bear attention because it represents a very real **David vs Goliath** threat to big pharmaceutical companies Biogen and Eli Lilly. I also believe that the deliberate or accidental misinformation and FUD campaigns will ultimately serve to benefit SAVA as investors (you retards) realize the full story of what is going on.

Due to this recent price action following the release of positive 9 month open label data, I believe SAVA  provides an even better asymmetric risk opportunity. In other words, I think the stock is currently trading at a discount.

**Positions:** 3954 SAVA, $10c 01/21/22, $20c 01/21/22, $45c 01/21/22, $22.5c 01/20/23

* Here is a link to SAVA's most recent [corporate presentation]( for those of you who can

**Addendum:**

If the drug doesn’t work in 9 month, it will not work in p3. Let's construct a simple probability chart where we have 4 different possibilities and the probability of each possibility below:

||Works at 9 month OL|Doesn’t Work at 9 month OL|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Works in Phase 3|0.05|0|
|Doesn’t work in Phase 3|0.15|0.8|

In this example, **given** that Simufilam works for 9 month Open Label, it now has a much better chance of working in Phase 3. To illustrate this, we just cross out ""Doesn't Work at 9 month OL""

||Works at 9 month OL|~~Doesn’t Work at 9 month OL~~|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Works in Phase 3|0.05|~~0~~|
|Doesn’t work in Phase 3|0.15|~~0.8~~|

Prior to knowing 9 month data, the drug has a 5% chance of working (sum the top two cells). After 9 month data it has a 0.05/(0.05+0.15) = 25% chance of working at phase three.",$SAVA Monster Writeup Part 3: Valuation,53,7

Ecovyst! This play will make you SO RICH you can finally fuck some strippers to satisfy yourself since your wife won’t.

&amp;#x200B;

Ecovyst (ECVT) just announced a special dividend of $3.2/share, which at a share price of $16.2 is OVER a 20% return! Now I am not here to talk about a boomer 20% return, but more so how this news has not been priced into the stock/options and provides a perfect short-term options play

Over the past few days ECVT has traded relatively flat, only really increasing over the past day or so. News of this insane dividend has barely made any headlines and no one seems to know about it. Once more people find out about this stock and buy in for that 20% return, the price will EXPLODE

Since the announcement of the dividend, the stock has ONLY increased by 8 cents



&amp;#x200B;

The stock ‘should’ drop around $3.2 after the ex. dividend date (efficient market hypothesis) which ‘should’ mean people won’t buy in just for the dividend, but people (and the market in general) are irrational and greedy so stocks generally have run-ups prior to special dividends (see price action on RKT, MCFE, AFG, SUTL ect.)

Special dividends also signify to the market that the company is being successful

In addition to this, the stock has low liquidity with an average trading volume of only around 223,000 shares and an institutional ownership of OVER 69%. This means the stock will MOON if only a small amount of people buy in

&amp;#x200B;

Besides the whole special dividend play, ECVT is actually a decent, profitable growth company. Y/Y revenues were up 47% and they posted a profitable quarter of $0.11/share. They manufacture and catalyze chemicals for green tech, which will be a growing industry in the future. I know this play is not about the viability of the company, but this being a decent company takes some of the risk away

Additionally, options have not priced in ANY pre-dividend volatility, the 8/20 $15C only needs to have the stock go up 0.92% to make money

The ex. Dividend date for the special dividend is aftermarket 8/11 so I would sell before then

The record date is on the 12th, so if you are feeling risky you could hold until 8/12

My positions:

10 8/20 $15 C, 10 8/20 $17.5 C

TLDR:



Edit: Turns out the ex div date was in the morning of 8/11 so I wish everyone luck, hope this doesn't fuck up the play",Ecovyst: Get rich from this special dividend,1584,7

Bayer AG, however, is currently trading at  only x1 revenues and only x8 price-to-earnings. The company is valued ridicously cheap!

I know, Monsanto. But let us acknowledge that the company has already accounted for 15b of claims. And besides the Monsanto story, Bayer AG is a strong company with attractive growth opportunities, high profit margins and valuable intellectual capital. Just go to your local pharma store and look how many products are branded by this company ... !

But most interesting is the underlying options market on Bayer AG. Implied volatility has it completely wrong, estimating the 1y / 1SD move at only 25%.  Considering the upcoming hearing with the US supreme court with regards to the Monsanto litigation, the implied expected move should be more like 50 - 70% -- which suggest a 100% upside potential just by going long volatility.

In August Bayer AG will file for a review the U.S supreme court. If the US supreme court accepts the review, the stock could move 30% just on that, and probably another 100% if the supreme court decides in favor of Bayer.

To sum up: I am very bullish with a long 10.000 US$ position on the Bayer AG call option chain ranging from 52 till 80. (Exp. Dec 2021 till 2022).","Redicously cheap company, inefficient options pricing and a potentially 100% upside catalyst",0,13

It's time for volatility, a new high, and a new low. Place your bets on SPY before Wednesday because that's when things will pop off. Discussing the following stuff below: GEX/DIX, Elliott wave, general TA

GAMMA / DARK POOL:
-GEX is the lowest it has been in a while, and the DIX is on the rise to test it's highest high. This setup of burning off excess gamma and the index pattern matches April 15th 2021 - May 12th, but on a slightly larger timeframe. I believe this is happening because dealers are holding cash liquid (that was sold after a bad CPI report, but prior to earnings, July 13-19) with hedges already placed on the market. Depending on the report of the CPI, they will place their bets on the megacaps, incides, and other analyzed securities. When GEX has a new low and DIX has a new high at the same time, it's time to buy. 

ELLIOTT WAVE:

We are nearing the end of the last leg of an uptrending Elliott Wave that's been going on since late March of 2021:

First leg ~ March 26-Sept 1st
Second leg ~ Sept. 2nd - Oct 30th. 
Third Leg ~ Nov 3 - May 6th
Fourth leg ~ May 10 - Jun 18
Final leg ~ June 18 - Aug 18.

Then we'll enter a period of consolidation on the large Elliott wave which will help bring speculative prices back down closer to true value. This is where I think we will see the return to low 400's on SPY. This is NOT the big, Burry-pocalyptic one. 

TECHNICALS:

RSI on SPX is at a healthy 61.3 on dailies and touching 70 on weeklies. I don't have much to say about the daily RSI other than it has room for growth and is expected to catch up to my trendline on the weekly chart. A bad CPI report will probably bump it down to 41-42 level like the previous 3 times. 

I am confident in one final push of growth on the weekly RSI as it will test the all time high (set in early may) and give way to a lower low which, at this point, is only 69.5 (and the next big low is like 5 points below that)The volatility of a quick rise up to 455 and fall to 410 will allow SPX to maintain a more realistic RSI while maintaining an uptrend. 

Megacaps are all due for a short term rise to test ATH from technical standpoint, plus most of them had positive ERs, or some good news in terms of short term trading. 


TL;DR:
Following a positive CPI (below M/M inflation) report on Wednesday, SPY will go to 450-55 by Aug 18th-20th. Then it will quickly retrace down to 415-405 area in the first 2 weeks of september and then consolidate into ~ Oct 1st. 

If CPI is higher than expected, we will see a quick gap down like in may/june/july to 435 followed by a failed retesting of ATH into the first two weeks of September, then falling down to 425 area into the first week of October. 


Positions:

I will be focusing on just one particular aspect of their business that I think is really intriguing: school busses.

The yellow school bus is the largest form of mass transit in America and **outnumbers all others by more than two and a half times combined**. This fleet of busses transports over 26 million students each day. 

There's one big problem though. Of the currently 480,000 school busses in operation in the US today, [fully 95% of them are run on fossil fuels]( 

Studies have demonstrated that pollution levels on these school busses often exceed surrounding areas [by five to 10 times]( This can cause a [multitude of health problems]( for the kids who use these busses (which is over half of all public school students) such as asthma, bronchitis, developmental disabilities, and cancer and studies show they even [hurt students' test scores](

Even worse, about \~160,000 of these busses were manufactured before the EPA diesel emissions standards took effect in 2007, meaning they are even worse ([producing 90% more harmful emissions than busses built today]( and desperately need to be replaced. 

And this isn't even getting into how bad school busses are for the environment overall, as they can contribute to the production of [smog, acid rain, and other air pollution](

Despite all this though, the Federal government only dealt out a **pitiful $10m in 2020 for school bus replacements of all fuel types** (so not even focused on electric). This is extremely underfunded compared to the $130m given to transit busses the same year, and even more laughable compared to investments by [other countries]( 

**But enough about kids and the planet dying, let's get to the good stuff. Namely: how do I make money off of this?**

The three top US based school bus manufacturers are [Blue Bird]( [IC Bus]( and [Thomas Built]( all of which have recognized the problem of fossil fueled school busses and have each unveiled their own versions of the school ebus. However, just because they're the big dogs, doesn't mean that they will stay there. Competition for the school bus market is becoming tight, with the number of manufacturers going from just six, to a total of ten [in just the last decade alone]( All competing for about [40,000 school busses sold yearly]( Now, the fact that all busses need to go electric does mean this number will most likely increase, but the fact remains, that the need of electric busses for schools by all corners of the sector means the competition will only get tighter and not all of them will succeed. 

And before you think it's easy to make a school bus, just know that there are **approximately 9,000 to 12,000 different parts of a school bus**, with a possible bin of 23,000 parts these manufacturers can call from. This is due to the fact that school busses are not synonymous across the board, and actually require a relatively high degree of customization and specific design for each order. As CEO of major school bus manufacturer BlueBird, Phil Horlock, explained in their 2021Q2 Earnings Call: 

“The actual customization of a school bus is incredible at the school district, rightly so, you know, they drive a different topography, their weather conditions are different, they want the unique requirements. So, we have a federal level of standard, we have a state level of standard, and we have a school district level of standard. That is a lot to handle. \[...\] I think that's the biggest challenge for any of these startup companies out there, who have sold a few hundred vehicles or actually not even sold any, when they say \[they're\] going to sell several thousand in the next few years.” 

As such, what we will most likely see is a relatively similar situation to what is currently happening in the consumer ev market: top legacy payers are just catching on to the ev craze, but with absolutely [massive amounts of money]( they are bringing to the table combined with their decades long relationships with government agencies, they'll quickly catch up and squeeze out more nascent players. As such, it's important to remember that many of the new ebus manufacturers will most likely face stiffer competition than their current projections anticipate. 

**Which brings us to Proterra.**

Proterra does not make their own school busses. Instead, they've partnered with o**ne of the oldest and most well known school bus manufacturers in the United States, Thomas Built Busses**, to produce the school busses for them, while they focus on the battery packs and powertrain that actually propels the vehicle. 

This has several advantages:

* Instead of attempting to compete with legacy school bus manufacturers, Proterra can utilize the Century long relationships Thomas Built Busses has already built up to swiftly and quickly gain contracts and form relationships. 
* Building just the battery packs and powertrains means that Proterra can largely rely on Thomas Built current logistical manufacturing capability and avoid having to try and scale up their own factory production too much.
* Thomas Built can utilize Proterras decade plus experience developing electric powertrains for busses to swiftly and quickly push out electric vehicles, skipping a few steps and enabling them to circumvent many of the problems and R&amp;D their rivals will have to invest time and money in. 

Essentially, while Proterra focuses on the electric output, Thomas Built can focus on the bus frame itself, such as developing first of its kind features available like their [Auto-Reversing Door]( as well developing  prototypes of new pedestrian detection technology to prevent pedestrian accidents outside of the school bus. 

Furthermore, Proterra is able to utilize their credibility to smoothly enter new markets, a task that can take a lot of time and effort from newer, less established school bus makers. A [prime example]( is how Thomas Built busses recently received full California Air Resources Board (CARB) and Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project (HVIP) certificates for its Type C electric bus (the Saf-T-Liner C2 Jouley) as well as announced eligibility for funding from the California Energy Commission (CEC). This means that rather than spending the time and energy going through this cumbersome and lengthy process themselves, Proterra instead just needs to focus on the electric propulsion tech while Thomas does all the heavy lifting in terms of securing new customers. 

This comes in especially handy when dealing with support networks, as, sticking with the California example, Thomas Built [already has established relations]( with local vendors, such as BusWest, who are able to immediately provide maintenance and support to customers as soon as the first electric busses roll out. 

As such, (and yes I'm really trying to hone in on this point here) Proterra can quickly and efficiently enter new markets without having to worry about establishing support networks or local contacts with the state/county/etc.

This symbiotic relationship has already reaped significant rewards, with Proterra/Thomas Built securing the[ largest US school bus order]( ever this past February with a municipality that is looking to eventually replace its entire 1,400 unit fleet of school busses. And if they’re filling 300+ school bus orders with barely any federal funding assistance, imagine how easy it will be to convince local school boards to replace their aging, kid-killing boxes of environmental death with shiny, new and (very important here) Thomas Built Backed school busses when billions start coming down from the federal government?

In fact, with the Infrastructure Bill [set to pass the senate]( early Tuesday morning, federal funds for school busses is about to see an increase of 10 million a year to a possible pot of [5 Billion]( a **10,000% increase in funding**. Even cutting this new money in half (as half of the funding is possibly being allowed to go to low emission busses) should still represent a **massive increase** in funds available for electric school busses. 

This combined with the fact that many local school authorities are mandating only electric school busses going forward (with [many studies and organizations pointing to 2030]( as when the entire school bus fleet should be all electric) means that electric school bus manufactures are in for a **brisk business over the next decade**. 

Due to these macro conditions, it's not unlikely to think that most, if not all of Thomas Built school busses will be electric by the end of this decade. That would be a significant boon to their Proterra partner, which as the battery pack and powertrain developer, would stand to reap significant rewards from piggy backing off of the mass conversion of their fleet.

And none of this is even touching on any further money that will be disbursed through the 3.5 trillion reconciliation bill that Democrats desperately want to include more ev funding in, with Democratic lawmakers [saying]( “they’ll be pushing to go much further to build out EV charging and convert the nation’s bus fleets” in the larger companion bill. 

Electric school busses are the future, and not the far off future, but a very close and present one. Besides the fact that local and state governments are moving to mandate all school buses be electric, the economics of electric school busses is only getting better and better. Electric school buses are [60% less expensive to operate and maintain]( than traditional fossil fuel busses, which means schools can invest more in students, teachers, and learning opportunities.

Add on to this the fact that these new federal funds from the Infrastructure Bill means the upfront costs of a school ebus is essentially the same as a standard fossil fuel bus, the facts all point to huge demand for electric school busses very, very soon. A demand that Proterra is poised to take advantage of in a way that I do not see any other company competing in. Legacy players will have to invest time, energy, and funds into fully developing their electric bus divisions. More recent startups will have to compete with the decades (and for some centuries) long reputations and connections of the legacy players once they fully ramp up. Proterra, through Thomas Built busses, stands out as uniquely able to benefit from the pro’s of each category while neatly circumventing the con’s. 

Tldr: Government mandates and five billion in funding means Thomas Built Busses will go majority electric by the end of the decade, which means big bucks for their primary electric powertrain partner, Proterra.

&amp;#x200B;

[Insider buying in 2021](

That, Ladies and Gentlemen, is 2021 insider buying that is still not really seeing profit (SAGE currently trades at $43.20 at the time of writing). The insiders have bought in ranges of $43.x-56.x for at total of **$2,615,399** this year.

The company reported results from the late stage study (whatever that means, I'm not really into pharma/biotech) that were - [according to own words]( \- positive yet somehow disappointed investors who sliced the stock by \~40% since. Talk about being sensitive, sheesh..

&amp;#x200B;

[10h 30d chart](

If you bother reading all the [bots on Twitter,]( it seems that the robots are fairly hyped by this CEO purchase. The stock is also up \~5% today, maybe because of that news.

I know financials are boring since you'd rather buy OTM options on TSLA $1000 for next week, but for that one special person that ends up looking, [here goes](

[Fundamentals](

So, a price to book (P/B) value close to 1. Um, okay. That's rare to see these days. But what's more rare is a P/E of 3.47. Trading below 50 multiples in the year of 2021, I'm lost for words. Anyway, in reference to the above image of financial jargon:

Green = good  
Red = bad

No, I don't care about the SI. Scroll to the bottom why. That out of the way, lets move on.

[The CEO apparently has nothing else to do but talk]( which he'll do both tomorrow (the 10th) and the day after tomorrow (the 11th for the slow). I have no idea if this means anything, I told you already, I'm not really into pharma/biotech stuff.

So, now you might ask, why does a person with no knowledge about pharma/biotech write about a pharma/biotech stock on a forum of degenerates?

**Rebound.**

I don't really care about whatever trial or phase X study they got rolling. The stock was sliced 40% in two months cause someone had their expectations hyped to the moon and got mad. I see insider buying as a strong signal of trust towards the company and their pipeline.

This play is only surrounding a rebound from that massive drop from the 14th to 15th of June and nothing more. I don't see any financial indicators as to why the stock needs to plummet nor do I see any news related that should explain it.

It's more interesting to watch paint dry than look at the options chain. Only notable strike is 40p for 20th of August with high OI compared to any other strike this year on both sides. That's not really talking into the play here but take it for what you want.

While analysts previously had an average price target in the high 90s to 100s that has been cut down with the lowest being $62 (there's still price targets in the high 90s), which at current price is still a \~$20 or \~43.5% upside from where it trades now.

**My position**

Since I've lost more than half my account buying stupid OTM options or straddles on stocks that flat lined I've become poor and could only afford this:

The crux of the argument here is that Draft Kings has so many catalysts that aren't priced in. Of course, the risk is that these catalysts won't end up happening. Which I will get to at the end. 

The rundown: 

Draft Kings current market cap is 22 billion. They've grown revenue by over 300% in the past year. That's just with NJ, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and a bunch of smaller midwestern/southern states. 

Pennsylvania: 12 million

New Jersey: 9.4 million. 

Virginia: 8.6 million. 

Draft Kings has managed a 300 PERCENTAGE REVENUE GROWTH with just a bunch of smaller states. They've beat earnings estimates on every quarter. So what do you think happens when bigger states start legalizing? 

Florida: 21 million. 

Florida has already legalized. You will be able to download draft kings and bet on football games October 15. That is already going to cause a tremendous amount of market cap to this stock as they continue to smash earnings reports every quarter. I can just tell you as someone who grew up in Miami, there are more gambling degenerates in that state then all the other legalized states combined.

Canada: 38 million.

It's literally an entire country. And it didn't fully legalize there, they've so far only allowed single game betting. But as soon as they get a taste of that tax revenue, the Canadians are inevitably going to deregulate further. That means a day where you wake up and see ""Draft Kings up 5% as Canada to allow multi event sports betting""

New York: 19 million

New York has made plans to legalize online sports betting. But it hasn't happened just yet. And it will be closely regulated and heavily taxed. However, it's the home of tons of data analysts and number crunchers that all think they are geniuses. Everyone there already bets retail, online apps will just make it easier for those coke snorting finance associates to blow thousands of dollars betting on the Knicks making it to the second round. No matter how much the NY government tries to ruin online sports betting, there will be plenty of revenue there. 

Of course, the biggest reason I think this is a buy is because 2 of the biggest catalysts aren't priced in at all because they are at least a few years from happening and they aren't certain. 

California: 39 million.

Texas: 30 million. 

The reason I'm so sure these states are going to legalize is because of the reasons for making Sports betting illegal in the first place. Sports betting was made illegal because of organized crime and leagues complaining that it compromised the integrity of their games. But professional athletes no longer take coach busses to their out of state games while wearing chuck taylors. You couldn't bribe an athlete to lose because they are being payed so much more to win. Lebron James has a net worth of $500 million. Good luck paying him to lose. In fact, it's leagues that are now PUSHING for online sports betting because they realize it generates more viewers. 

Conservatives and liberals (not making a political statement, just stating facts) in Texas and California are very paternalistic, they want to protect people from the evils of gambling. But just like both Florida and New York realized that making online gambling illegal is pointless and just costs the state money, so will Texas and California. And those will be huge, astronomical catalysts. 

The Risks:

Obviously, nobody can predict the future. Nobody knows when Texas, California, and other states will legalize online sports betting, or if they will. But as someone who studies politics, I can just say that deregulation often move with momentum. Take marijuana, first a few states legalized medical marijuana. Then one state legalized it recreationally. Now state by state is starting to realize ""Hey this happened in other places and it didn't turn the place into a druggy wasteland so maybe it's not so bad."" so they are all doing it. Simply put, the reasons for making online gambling illegal in the first place are just no longer there, and there's a lot of money to be made in the industry, so it will be legalized.

The company I’m going to be talking about today is AVIR. 

What is AVIR? Well it’s a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing oral therapies. It IPO’d recently and has a market cap of currently as I write this 2.75 billion. I know what you’re thinking, “yeah yeah yeah another explosive biopharma that will pump and dump”. 

Well unlike your traditional clinical stage bio company, these guys have a ridiculous backing from some of the biggest names in the biopharma space.

Fidelity- just raised their stake by 60% quarterly into AVIR to about $335 million.

Cormorant- holds a $200 million + stake.

Bain Capital- $175 million

RA Capital- $167 million

Perceptive- $96 million

Not to mention Goldman Sachs also holds about a $60 million dollar stake. Seems small but when the companies market cap is under 3 billion, all of these stakes add up. I believe institutional ownership is at around 60% which is abnormal in this space.

So what’s there to be excited about? In particular one drug. That drug is called AT-527. If you look at the chart of AVIR you’ll notice it spiked from roughly 24$ -  $94.17 in the span of a month. This is all because of this beautiful little drug. AT-527 is an oral, direct activist antiviral drug candidate which is being evaluated for COVID-19. It is currently in Phase 3 and the results from Phase 2 were astounding. It was well tolerated in 35 COVID-19 patients and in 28 HCV-infected patients. The results were so good in fact they secured a partnership with ROCHE (one of the biggest bio tech companies out there) and continue working together to bring this drug to market.

Now as we’ve seen, COVID is not going away. The delta variant is spreading rapidly and now CNBC is already touting headlines that supply chain issues are starting again. The fear mongering has started and it’s only going to get worse as 40% of the population refuses to get vaccinated. The sentiment has started to change and the market is looking for a cure, I believe AVIR is well equipped to deliver. AVIR is the closest company out there to having a drug in pill form ready to distribute for the population. 

CASH AND RUNWAY

So AVIR is in a fantastic situation financially right now. They currently have around $800 million + in cash and are sitting at around $250 million + in debt. They came out and said this will give them enough runway to pursue all their programs through 2023. In biotech it’s common for companies to dilute their stock in order to raise cash and this OFTEN times kills momentum. One of the most frustrating things to see as an investor. AVIR also has 2 other programs moving forward (AT-752) Fighting against Dengue Fever and (AT-787) which fights against Hepatitis C. 

The stock has been beaten down from its 52 week high of 94$ to roughly $18 on seemingly no news… absurd I know but the rally has started back up. The MACD has curled and we are already at 33$ give or take a few cents. I think moving forward this could easily be a 10 billion dollar company if all goes according to plan. The upwards momentum right now has no plans of slowing down. The RSI is an a pretty healthy spot on the 1 month and 6 month. I believe a short term PT of 55$ is not unreasonable and the sky is the limit for long term potential.

Keep in mind that the distribution of their drug will be much easier too. They are already well equipped to deliver it around the world and it is CONSIDERABLY more feasible to distribute a pill form substance rather than one that needs to be injected. 

We are expecting Phase 3 news which could be an amazing catalyst in the 2h of 2021. Not to mention we are also expecting a Phase 1 result of AT-752 for Dengue Fever in 2h of 2021 as well.

This DD isn’t the most complex but I promise you take a look for yourself and you will not be disappointed. 

As always, My position is currently 1,000 shares at 27$.. skys the limit here fellas, hop in while you can 🚀 🚀

\- Growth oriented, slow and steady (I know everyone wants 100% every day, and this isn't your stock if that is the case).  The market and industry is rapidly growing for AI Technology, more and more companies will likely look for AI solutions

Running some very basic #s using latest reported revenues. This is a super-duper-dum-dum analysis with dum-dum math and Assumptions:

This also assumes they are not significantly adding to, or reducing their operating costs

|2025|149|594|73|292|

&amp;#x200B;

So if the bottom is around where we are now (lets say $50)

And if the chart above which is likely a terrible representation of where they will go as far as earnings.

I would target AI @ $142 by 2025.

(\*EDIT\* - This Price Target may be a bit high, \~ 47 P/E based on my numbers, though feasible, \~$100 per share is a more achievable PT by 2025, anything can happen, anything).  

So though this isn't a 10 bagger, I still think its a pretty solid 1-2 bagger at current levels (that is if you are willing to wait for a few years).  There are surely many other better buys out there and competition may increase, but the industry is very new still so I am willing to make a gamble and say that these are probably very safe #s.  My hope is the company will out-perform the estimated growth rate of 30% of a year (or make some wild deals or even be bought up by a larger company).

An all out crash and in the future us seeing different US market conditions than we've had over the last 30 years.

# Making a more efficient bet  

# 

 

**Betting the market stops or slows**

Timing a top is hard. Super hard. If in 2006 I told you the exact price the SPX would top and crash 50% off, that info would have made it very hard for you to actually ""Time"" the top. You could have sold into the top tick. Forecast the point the market stopped rising higher. But this would not be the same as making a timely forecast on the crash - you'd have been really early.

Forecasting the right price level also has it's difficulties but if you have ways to make estimates of zones in which you'd expect to see major inflection points you can start to take on a bearish bet on the market by first betting that the market will stop going up. Not crash. Just stop going up. You bet the market will not go above a certain price.

Absent of someone telling us in 2006 where the SPX would make a high, we'd have had to have some way to forecast important levels beforehand. Our best method (That I know of) to do this would have been to use a 161 extension off of the last pullback. Starting shorting as it hits the 161 and trades a bit above the 161. If 220 breaks this is the short exit signal.

And in 2008 that would have worked pretty well on task of picking out the important area to trade in. But look how tough it would be here to make money on puts. It hits the level and goes sideways for a few months, spikes out and then the move happens over just one candle. So getting in when it's happening is tough and trying to be on-time without being too early is tougher.

And that was just to catch the first drop. Then another rally comes before the real crash. So we have a period of several months in which the market is setting up for a 50% drop but being very unaccommodating to bearish bets on that if we're using put options as our main way of speculating on the move.

&amp;#x200B;



 But if instead when the market tags into the 161 on the first touch we start to bet on the market slowing down and not going higher, then almost everything that will happen from here to the low will be either really good or very acceptable for this position. The range is profitable for us and apart from a couple candles most of the candles in this area are just little ranging ones before the break.

When selling call spreads here we are usually get a pay off of close to 1:1. If we risk $100 we can win $100.

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Adding crash bets**

Once you have some call credit spreads in you've greatly reduced your chances of being right but still losing, which is a very real possibility otherwise. You've made it more likely that if you lose it is just because the market is not crashing. Not because the market is not crashing yet but you've been at it for too long to keep going.

Now we can start to add in some bets on a sharp break in the market by buying put options. The call credit spread we've sold was expensive. Calls are very expensive at market highs and we're selling them at the money. These are much, much cheaper than OTM puts - these are priced really low because the market has been up or ranging for a long time.

We'd need a way to target a price drop in the crash and the best available option to us in real time would have been to draw a 161 from the last low to high and assume this was the topping swing - and then use these fibs for downside targets. This would give us an expected exit in a good trade somewhere between the 127 and 161 fibs.

 



 If we're going aggressive on put options we can buy strikes just a bit above there and these will be incredibly cheap relative to the calls sold. If we buy a deep OTM put for a strike something like 1370 our upside on the trade if the market does crash increases massively, while our downside in the event it does not crash only increases a tiny little bit. If the market just does nothing for a few months we still breakeven. 

 

If the market crashes within those months you do super well. If the market ranges you win, come in breakeven or have quite small losses and if the market rips against you you've got a predefined loss that's not going to get worse whether it's 5% higher or 50% higher.

The SPX general top in 2007 would take about a year. As with all big market moves people will report the crash as being impossible to foresee, but if you used some basic TA models you'd have watched, waited and wondered for a full year and by the time you were hearing ""The news"" - you'd know what you were going to do.

So here this type of position could have been taken 6 times. Would be ""Right eventually"" and either be slightly profitable or at least pay for itself in the run up to the crash actually happening. A strategy of just buying puts would have likely exhausted your will and resources sometime into the final few months, weeks or even days before the crash.

&amp;#x200B;



&amp;#x200B;

 

**Our SPX**

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's look at the SPX of our times. And let's assume we've taken a lesson from 2008 and when the March drop happened we drew a 161 fib and were ready to engage shorts into that area. Once we got into the 161 there's been a couple months sideways action and now we're into a spike out of this action.



 

Looking much like these conditions.

 



 

Using the same basic theories and strategies of an options position here we can bet on the market making a short-term crash, maybe even turning into a full crash. While also covering us against whipsaw bear/bull traps moves into the high and giving us a way to benefit from such a whipsaw back to the high by selling high value call spreads into it to get cheap OTM puts.

We can set ourselves up positions that will be profitable in these three types of moves. Almost entirely removing the risk of being generally right but specifically wrong on any aspect of timing, bounces and speed of the move. You're only going to lose if the market continues upwards - and the area of tolerance for moves against the position isn't that big, and the net risk is capped.



&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

**In conclusion**

As is oft said, timing tops is hard. But that's not a reason to stop thinking. If you make a study of previous market tops you'll find there was usually ways to approximate the zone in which the market would reverse. To know when was hard and in real time it'd not have looked like it was going to - but to make a structured plan before it and take a position into the high was possible.

If anyone does not think these things are applicable today, you can draw a fib from the high to low of the 2018 drop in the SPX and see how this strategy performed into the March 2020 drop. It still seems pretty relevant. To me it represents the best way to bet on a 50% crash without making a complete ""Hail Mary"" out of it.

These are the base concepts I'll be using to build up my bet on a big crash. What would have to be the biggest drop we've seen - making March look cuddly - and could start to become obvious sometime during Q4 of this year.

SUP SMARTS. First post here.

In 6 weeks PBF stocks lost 50% with HFs shorts attack. Nothing dramatical happened within the company, but capitalisation felt to $1B while PBF has $1.5B in cash.

&amp;#x200B;

[PBF Energy](

just look to key facts here

**Pros:**

• No. 5 biggest refinery company in the US (6 facilities in 4 states, 6th bought in 2019 for $1.5B - more than current total capitalisation(!))

• $1.5B in cash (enough for buy one more lol)

**• 321 Crack spread now is $24 (first time since 2018) vs. $20 in Q2 2021 vs. $10 in Q3 2020. Simply - PBF now making approx. $3.5-4M extra per day (with 90% of max 1000 bpd production) in comparison to Q2 2021.**

• Revenue for Q2 is $6.9B - keep increasing

• EPS for Q3 likely to be positive for the first time since 2020 even the spread will down to $20-22

• Production rates will keep increasing form 90% to approx 93% in Q3 due to petroleum consumption. It will not hit above 95% since all yearly maintenance work going on May-September period.  


[CRACK321  2016 - 2021](

**Cons:**

**• Huge long term debt - around $6B with covering starts in 2023**

**• RIN prices** \- which are currently killing small refineries - RIN D6 still nearly $1.5 (slightly lower of max $1.62 in June 2021). But this situation will change soon since 2 things will happen: 1. US administration will likely reduce blending mandates for 2021-2022 according to ([1]( ,[2]( , [3]( 2. Renewable diesel production will increase significantly through 2024 ([Renewable diesel production forecast](

&amp;#x200B;



I'm sure in Q3 PBF will increase their cash or will start to cover short term debts.

With all this facts fair capitalisation should be around **$2.5B (or $20-22/share).** In 2022 capitalisation likely will keep rising to $3B.

90% of total shares is hold by insiders and institutions (most of them bought before 2020 for &gt;$30). More than 15% of float shares in short (seen the data for July, 15 - now the persentage of shorts should be higher). Only need any positive trigger that will lead HFs cover their shorts and $PBF will surge dramatically. Thats could be:

• US/Canada, US/Mexico land borders opening // US/EU regular flights increasing

• $1T infrastructure bill

• RINs regulation relief - the most desirable

Bought 2k shares and will buy all-in up to 10k between $12-16.

**Target - $22-24**. If it become a meme - shares can rise up to **$28-30**. Not the worst opportunity to apply your **YOLO** philosophy. Funds can be doubled within 4-6 weeks, just wait any positive release.

If $PBF will hit $16 before Aug, 20 I will drop my email waiting for offers to replace retarded clerks who keep shorting while crack spread is in the highest level since 2018.

And do not trust to forecasts. For example, if you trust Credit Suisse forecast for $PBF you would sell it for $4-7 in spring 2020, then buy it March 2021 for $17 and now sell for $9 lol.

P.S.

Already applied same strategy with:

• $HAL - first buy $7 (03/20) - aggressively buy $6-8 - sold $14 (06/20)

• $PBF - first buy $7 (04/20) - aggressively buy $7-11 - sold $13 (06/20)

• $PBF - first buy $7 (12/20) - aggressively buy $7-11 - sold $16 (03/21)

• $MAC - first buy $7 - aggressively buy $8-12 - still hold

• $SPCE - first buy $22 (04/21) - aggressively buy $20-27 - sold $39 (06/21)

• $HOOD - first buy $34 (08/21) - aggressively buy $35-40 - sold $50 (08/21)

Will do with:

• Rivian - first buy - IPO '21

• Instacart - first buy - IPO '21

The company was founded in 2014 as a spin-off of the old SallieMae.  Importantly, this company has expanded into data collection or some kind of logistics for state government unemployment compensation benefits and Covid contact tracing.  Much of this company's growth in earnings over the last year has come from these fields rather than their student loan division.

Navient's stock has gone up 118% YTD.  The P/E ratio is still a paltry 4, with a PEG of 0.17. 

Three other things that appeal to me are 1) the competition seems flaccid, including SallieMae proper, although I haven't checked whether their competitors are also branching out into data collection for state governments (perhaps I should), 2) Student loan forgiveness probably isn't going to happen in the short term, and even if it did, it's unclear what would happen to the company anyway, 3) nobody ever talks about Navient, unlike many other growth stocks that are regularly hyped online and elsewhere.  A reddit search for Navient stock mentions comes up with just a handful of posts in the last several years, none of which got many replies.

I was looking at this stock last spring when it was still trading at 15 (as opposed to ~21 currently) but got distracted and never followed through on it.  This week, however, I'm selling a portion of my Treasuries and starting out with a purchase of seventy (70) shares.",Making a play on Navient (NAVI) and cashing in on the student loan crisis,10,13

&amp;#x200B;



**Psychological**

SAVE is a budget airline that has destinations in 47 domestic locations and 28 international. They run the [cheapest flights](  with the [best on-time arrival rate]( among US-based budget carriers, and fourth in the industry. This little bird is hot in the press right now for [righteously fucking over]( half of their booked flights for a week now. But this moment allows them to [strengthen their systems]( and prevent it from happening after you buy your calls. What I hear at the ground level is, “Wow, I didn’t know so many people flew Spirit.” People are surprised to see the impact that this relatively small airline has had on vacation plans.

See, people talk down on Spirit but, they fly Spirit. We don’t care to remember the last time we flew, when that carry-on fee was a nasty surprise, we begrudgingly book the flight with the least layovers and the cheapest cost. When it really comes down to it, our little animal brains want to buy at the low number and sell at the high number (except for you drooling degenerates).  The recent slate of bade news presents an opportunity to buy a fundamentally strong company at the low number. 

**Fundamental**

The meat and potatoes, Spirit is valued at a market cap of 2.9bn. They [have cash equivalents of 2.2bn ]( dollars. This company is my personal favorite because they are among the only airlines expanding their operations, while remaining small and nimble enough to grapple with the uncertainties present in the airline industry.

While companies like DAL are[ bitching and moaning ]( about significant debt pressures, Spirit is extinguishing 331m in debt early. Unlike budget airline peers that I hoping to get by, SAVE is [increasing their fleet]( into 2022. The expected available seat miles are also expected to exceed pre-pandemic levels. 

SAVE operates at the highest operating ratio relative to low-cost-carriers and is only beaten by travel giant DAL. This informs us that SAVE has greater operational cost efficiency. Not only do they have incredible operational efficiency they have the [lowest cost per mile in the USA ]( Additionally, SAVE has the second lowest price to book value among US-based airlines at 1.289 and is well below analyst price targets of $39.91/s.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 1. Operational ratio among competing airlines](

    
 **Technical**

  
I trade channels and triangles, not much else. You can see very clearly that there is a channel within which SAVE has been trading on the 20D/1H. The bottom range of that channel is the best time to buy, the second-best time is now, or don’t fuck you.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 2. 20D\/1H from 08\/05](

We can see that there is plenty of upside potential throughout the holiday season when air travel is expected to be heaviest. I expect further consolidation within this channel, but continued price discovery to 30 before FDA approval of the $PFE vaccine that should extinguish many fears surrounding air travel and send this thing ripping. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 3. 180D\/4H from 08\/05](

**Downside Risk**

Downside risk to Spirit is centred on two central themes, staffing and COVID. [Staffing is a big reason]( why flights are being cancelled. But staffing shortages are not unique to the airline industry nor are they resultant of decreased demand. As Americans are compelled back to work by changes in public policy, hiring incentives, and relaxed worries about COVID we can expect to see substantial improvements in staffing and economic activity, nationally. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 4. COVID case rates in Florida](

The Delta Variant of COVID19 is of increasing concern. Particularly, in Florida. However, depressing this news is and badly it batters the value of the stock it does not fundamentally devalue the airline if air travel continues to exceed expectations (as it has). In fact, I would argue that buying while cases are high, and prices are depressed offers the best value. 

**Conclusion**

Spirit Airlines has a lot of bad news in the airwaves. But if you can get through the noise, it’s clear that this company is fundamentally the best low-cost-carrier to invest in. Spirit is entering a growth cycle exactly when it is needed. The operational efficiency of this airline and the value it provides to customers make it a no-brainer while air travel ticks back up to pre-pandemic levels and beyond. A technical setup within a consolidation pattern presents an excellent buying opportunity.

This is your opportunity to reclaim your carry-on costs. Please board the ✈️, get duct taped to the seat, and prepare for takeoff 🚀

Thesis:

WFA (Work from Anywhere) became a huge trend this spring and summer as people got vaccinated (Jan-Apr) and weren't required to go into the office. I believe TONS of people took advantage of this with pent up demand for domestic travel (international restrictions still apply in many areas).

Enter AirBNB, the clear-cut leader in the rent-someone-else's-home space (nice try, VRBO). They are commanding a huge market share with the most valuable demographics, and many businesses are now allowing business travel to expense AirBNB's -- recognizing that hotels are just one option.

RE investors are a tailwind: with home prices at ATH, there's a throng of younger RE investors that have been buying/rehabbing/renting properties in high-demand cities. There's a whole ecosystem building around property management, cleaning, and listing for AirBNB owners. Low rates = lots of new supply.

I think this is the ER that the business opens people's eyes after their version of the COVID-19 full house (kind of like PTON last year).

Firstly, forgive me in advance for the rambling nonsense I’m about to write out since I need to get around the dumb auto—mod who is going to remove my post for being 0 IQ. 

 $MQ - Marqeta has earnings this week, and I’m bullish only because no one here has talked about $MQ at all. They’re also in a boring fucking industry, credit processing, which indicates that no one thinks about going and making a meme stock out of it. They have some pretty solid fundamentals — and the clients they’re working with include Uber, JPMorgan Chase, DoorDash, etc. They’re also going to be helping Goldman Sachs ($GS), (who is making a shit ton of money and outperforming the market, as-is) open their checking accounts before the end of the year, same thing for Affirm, who is going to eventually provide a “Buy now pay later” card that’ll be able to be used on ANY purchase, not only those available on the Affirm platform. Once Marqeta has these companies as clients, the don’t enough of a shit to go and find other card issuing solutions, since Marqeta does it all. 

[Marqeta’s website]( alone is more than enough to give me confidence that they know what they’re doing. I have no idea how credit processing works, other than that there is minimal risk for the card issuers and much more risk for both the merchant as well as the banks/those providing capital/money. 

Since MQ is into card/digital issuing, there’s minimal risk and downtime for consumers who fall for credit card fraud — they’re able to be issued new cards instantly, with new card numbers, which they can use right away. Plastic will be a thing of the past within a few years. According to Google and some bullshit [MacRumors]( article, in 2019, over 65% of US retail merchants accepted Apple Pay (and other NFC/digital payments). 
Additionally, 74 of the top 100 merchants accepted Apple Pay. Marqeta also recently partnered with Google to provide cards for their [GooglePay]( platform. This will make MQ even more valuable, since consumers can get an account and start spending instantly, both online and in person.

To recap: MQ is working with Uber, Google, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Affirm, and other big companies to, what is likely, permanently provide card issuing solutions for them. They literally cannot lose money. The stock is also on sale right now. Earnings estimates are expected to be negative — they’re probably going to blow past it even if it is still negative, it’ll be free money. If they go positive, this will print. So now I ask: what is the play? Weeklies are available only for next week, so 8/20 $30c ? Dirt cheap.",Reposting this since you dumb morons will miss out on MQ,6,13

ALRIGHT RETARDS. This is the only $SAVA DD you'll need to read to understand how Simufilam works and the timeline of the research behind it. I broke it up into 3 parts so your tiny attention spans would be able to read it over time. This is the 2nd part, the part none of you want to read: **The science behind Simufilam.**

## TLDR:

1. Cassava Sciences is developing a new treatment for early to moderate stage Alzheimer’s called **Simufilam** and a diagnostic for Alzheimer’s Disease called **SavaDX**.
2. Cassava Sciences finished Phase 2 trials in September 2020 and are currently running Open Label trials. Cassava Sciences is starting Phase 3 trials in September 2021. Once Phase 3 trials are over, the FDA will decide on whether or not to approve Simufilam. I believe Simufilam’s Phase 2 and Open Label trial data are extremely promising - patients who are currently testing it are actually getting better.

# Cassava Sciences, Simufilam, and SavaDX

Cassava Sciences is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company. Its mission is to develop a treatment and diagnostic for Alzheimer’s disease.

Simufilam is a proprietary, small molecule oral (pill) drug that restores the normal shape and function of altered Filamin A (FLNA), a scaffolding protein, in the brain. Altered FLNA in the brain disrupts the normal function of neurons, leading to Alzheimer’s pathology, neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Simufilam is protected by patents.

SavaDx is an investigational blood test to detect Alzheimer’s disease. SavaDX is protected by trade secrets.

[Drug Development Timeline](

# Timeline of Drug Discovery and Research

1. 2012 - Preclinical Studies [\[1\]](
   1. Cassava Sciences published “Reducing amyloid-related Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis by a small molecule targeting filamin A”. In this paper, they show that Filamin A is required in the toxic signaling of amyloid-beta by the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which results in tau phosphorylation and formation of neurofibrillary tangles. They show that a new small molecule compound they discovered, called PTI-125 binds strongly to misfolded Filamin A. In this study, they used mouse models and postmortem human brain tissue.
2. 2017 - Preclinical Studies [\[1\]](
   1. Cassava Sciences published “PTI-125 binds and reverses an altered conformation of filamin A to reduce Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis”. In this paper they show that Amyloid Beta causes Filamin A to deform and induce associations with α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Since PTI-125 binds strongly to Filamin A, it restores the original function of this scaffolding protein in the brain and prevents negative downstream effects. This trial used mice and human brain samples.

[Mechanism of Action](

1. 2020 - Phase 2a Trial Results [\[1\]](
   1. Cassava Science published a paper “PTI-125 Reduces Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease in Patients'' describing the results of a phase 2a study. The objective of this study is to assess the Safety of PTI-125 and measure its effects on biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid and blood plasma for 28 days. This study included 13 mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease patients, age 50-85, Mini Mental State Exam ≥16 and ≤24 with a cerebrospinal fluid total tau/Aβ42 ratio ≥0.30. PTI-125 oral tablets (100 mg) were administered twice daily for 28 consecutive days. PTI-125 reduced cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease pathology, neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation from baseline to Day 28.
2. 2020 - Phase 2b Trial
   1. The design of the trial was as follows: Phase 2b was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-center clinical study of sumifilam (formerly, PTI-125). Sixty-four patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease, age 50-85, were randomized (1:1:1) to 100 mg or 50 mg oral sumifilam or matching placebo. Treatment was administered twice daily for 28 days. Nine U.S. study sites enrolled patients. A clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease was confirmed with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) ≥16 to ≤26 and a CSF T-tau/Aβ42 ratio ≥0.28. Safety was assessed by ECGs, clinical labs, adverse event monitoring and physical examinations.
   2. On May 15, 2020, Cassava [reported]( that they missed their primary endpoint in their Phase 2b trial. However, upon further analysis, they realized that the lab that ran their data made a mistake. (Lot of bears shit on the company for this reason, FUD in my opinion)
   3. On September 14, 2020, Cassava [reported]( final results for their phase 2b trial. 2021 - Open Label Trial. They reported that the drug was safe and well-tolerated, and that they met primary endpoints for biomarker data. They also showed improvement in cognition via the CANTAB test.

[Compared to placebo, biomarker data shows improvement across all biomarkers](

1. 2021 - Ongoing Open Label Trial
   1. 9 month Data was [presented]( to AAIC:

[CSF Biomarkers continued to improve](

[88&amp;#37; of patients responded](

[Cognition improved from 6 to 9 month Open Label](

Comparing 6 month Biomarker data to 2b biomarker data, while not academically sound, shows ***increasing*** effects on biomarkers.

# Conclusions:

1. SAVA has conducted preclinical trials, placebo controlled phase 2a trials, and placebo controlled phase 2b trials. Phase 2 trials have enough participants to show that Simufilam is **safe and well-tolerated.**
2. SAVA is conducting an Open Label (non placebo controlled) trial. This trial just completed 150 patients enrolled. [\[source\]]( They reported increasing 6 and 9 month cognition data on the first 50 patients, because the first 50 patients are the ones they have data for.
3. Placebo effects for Alzheimer's are most significant early on. Therefore, when data is released about 6 month and 9 month results, any placebo effect we should see is diminishing.
4. Two phase 3 studies are planned: the first is 12 months 600 patients placebo controlled testing for **cognition improvement,** the second is 18 months with 1000 patients placebo controlled testing for **cognition maintenance**. [\[recent slides\]]( [\[old announcement\]]( Note that they actually switched the order of these two phase 3 studies (they firsts announced 18 month trial for maintenance will be first). My wife's psychic says this is a bullish sign of confidence as the company wants to complete the more challenging 12 month **improvement** trial first.
5. Placebo groups for Alzheimer's in previous trials do not show increasing cognition at 9 months. For example, this is what the Aricept trial looked like: [\[source\]](

[Note placebo effect wears off after 12 weeks](

You’re all probably thinking, “WTF why Crocs? Their clogs are so ugly!” (Ticker: $CROX)

Well, despite the fact that they may have some footwear that isn’t the most attractive, they as a business are doing incredibly well and I’m sure most of you can put your feelings aside if there's some upside potential.

Crocs has had a **very** volatile history as a publicly-traded stock. They nearly went bankrupt during the financial crisis back in ‘08 but managed to survive. Their stock price was then pretty range-bound for nearly a decade before finally in the last few years started moving in the right direction.

Then during COVID, they seemed to gain some serious recognition through their support of [healthcare workers]( with free pairs of Crocs and they’ve continued their [celebrity endorsement]( marketing campaign where celebrities like Justin Bieber have endorsed their brand.

Google Trends shows a solid uptick in terms of “Crocs” queries since January 2018.

&amp;#x200B;



However, regardless of endorsements, PR events, and other things a company does to drive up demand and awareness, what’s most important are the numbers. So let’s take a look at their most recent [earnings report from Q2]( (Released July 22, 2021):

* Revenue grew **93.3% YoY** (a near double!) and 39% sequentially (QoQ)! That’s a **huge acceleration** from what was already a very strong Q1 report of 63.6% YoY.
* Non-GAAP Net Income **doubled** YoY and maintained the trend of 22% net income margins
* Non-GAAP EPS doubled from a year ago which means **their trailing twelve months of EPS is nearly triple** from what it was a year ago!
* Their shares outstanding also dropped 5% YoY from their accelerated share repurchases program, **so high EPS and share buybacks generally means more share appreciation**
* **Gross Margins increased by 600 basis points QoQ and 700+ basis points YoY to 61.7%,** for some context, 60%+ gross margins is REALLY high, especially for retail. Nike for example has 45.8% gross margins, Lululemon has 57.1% gross margins. Their gross margins have been ticking up since Q1 of last year
* Operating income came in at $195 M which represents **30% operating margins which is really good.** This is the highest operating margin they’ve ever in the past 5 years at leastt (as far as I looked).
* Their Wholesale business is on fire, in the Americas region, it increased **150% YoY** and APAC/EMEA weren’t too shabby at 76.4 and 82.6% respectively
* Their direct-to-consumer business is doing really well too. With Americas revenue going up 128% YoY. Their last 3 quarters of D2C Americas YoY growth were: 80.4%, 131.3% and 128.1%, so the second consecutive quarter of triple digit growth. In addition, what’s really encouraging is that their APAC and EMEA D2C businesses are starting to show some life with APAC which has been struggling since COVID turned out nearly 11% YoY growth and theiR EMEA business is now doing \~30% YoY growth. There is a huge opportunity for Crocs to expand internationally
* From a cash flow perspective, they **generated $212 M in cash flow which is really good seeing how they only generated $30 M last quarter and only $267 M in cash in ALL OF 2020.**
* ***GUIDANCE was 60-70% revenue growth for Q3*** **and 60-65% YoY revenue growth for 2021 which means Q4 will have 35% YoY revenue growth.** Since Crocs has historically beaten their revenue guidance, this means Crocs will stand to grow revenue 70%+ in 2021 and despite a tough comparison in Q4, will still stand to grow revenue by 35%+.

Let’s now talk about what management is thinking:

1. They are going to increase marketing spend and increase it a lot. The goal is to spend 7% of total revenue on marketing in the back half of Q2, which will likely amount to $100+ M assuming they keep up growth figures, this is a HUGE increase from their $28 M in marketing spend in Q1 &amp; Q2 combined.
2. They expect to see strong growth in all regions and in all channels as brand momentum continues.
3. They will have net zero emissions by 2030, so a lot of people who invest in companies, this is a plus for Crocs
4. They expect the strong international growth to continue

Fundamentally, this is a company that just had a very strong Q2 where their stock increased another 10%+ the next day. Remember, this stock is up 100%+ YTD already, so a lot of share price appreciation has been priced in and yet it continues to impress with such strong earnings results.

Assuming Crocs continues to outperform their guidance which they have in the past 4 quarters, Crocs will continue to see big EPS gains which will continue to be a boost for the company’s share price.

As with any stock, there are risks:

1. COVID continues to be a problem and may impact their supply chain
2. They increased their LT debt to $386 M after issuing a $350 M note, this is the highest level of debt they’ve had in the past few years. We’re in a low-interest-rate environment, so this should be fine, but something to monitor
3. Inventories increased to $209 M which is the highest level of inventory the company has had in the past few years. Something to continue to monitor.
4. Their brand momentum may slow down which would slow down sales

I have been looking at Coinbase recently. And I felt that the market, and analysts were all overly pessimistics concerning Coinbase Q2 earnings, which will be reported tomorrow.

Over Q1, Coinbase reported a 3.05 EPS, with a user growth from 2M to 6.1M transacting users, and in total 56M users. In total, they generated 1.8B revenue. They reached these impressive numbers thanks to the start of the bull market.

See below the number of transactions on the Bit-coin, over the last year.



&amp;#x200B;

Q2 report will be between April and June, which means during still-extremely strong volatility market. In my opinion, it should results to even stronger EPS, when they will announce their results. The crazy part is that consensus amongst analyst is 2.23 EPS for Q2 2021. It's 27% lower. Crazy right?

So yes, June to August looks weaker. The volatility levels seems to have been affected, as the Bit-coin plumetted from $60K to $40 - 45K today. However, Coinbase are not the kind of guys that will deliver a poor outlook on their future performances. On their last Q1 report, they said: "" “As we have previously discussed, it is important for investors to remember that our business is inherently unpredictable.” 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Analysts are totally wrong about projected Q2 EPS by over 30-40% for Coinbase. There is a great opportunity to buy calls, as the company will reveal its surprising Q2 results, without mentioning any interesting (and potentially harmful) outlook insights.

- Fabless semiconductor company based in Taiwan
- The main product consists of display drivers, basically the chip that runs a computer screen. They also provided the LCoS display for the original Google Glass in 2013, which is why yahoo finance lists it alongside AR plays.
- 2000 employees. More than 90% are engineers. 3000 patents.
- Market cap: $2.4B
- Share price: $13.92
- PE (ttm): 11.0
- Forward PE (for 2022): 8.6, but this assumes that the chip shortage is over in 2022

The automotive chip shortage was rather prominent in the news a few months ago but is still ongoing. The shortage is specifically due to the lack of display drivers. Himax controls 30% of the global market share for automotive display drivers. They expect the situation to be dire until 2023: 

Being fabless is not an issue as we can see from the EPS history:

- Q2 2020: $0.01
- Q3 2020: $0.07
- Q4 2020: $0.20
- Q1 2021: $0.38
- Q2 2021: $0.62 

And they expect up to $0.81 ($0.69 non-GAAP) for Q3. The EPS growth is due to higher gross margins, from 20% to almost 50% in a year. (Due to the shortage, they cannot exactly grow by selling more. They are selling everything they have.) These margins are not solely due to the chip shortage but also by focusing on more lucrative segments, e.g. tablets instead of smartphones. They have 60% market share for non-iOS tablet TDDIs. TDDI is a combination of display driver and touch controller, so you only need one chip instead of two to get a touch screen.

The last big share price movement was after the Q4 2020 results. It has been oscillating ever since. Even the Q2 earnings beat and the excellent guidance had zero effect on the share price. To put things into perspective, the latest EPS of AMD were $0.63 and the AMD share price is $110. So Himax has some room to run. It will most likely overtake AMD in terms of EPS in the next quarter. They serve different markets though, so the standards are a bit different.

Competitors:

- Samsung. PE of 17 and there is no room for growth anyway. Is a customer of Himax for tablet TDDIs.
- Novatek. Only traded in Taiwan. PE of 15. Five times the market cap of Himax but extremely similar overall. Share price is 10% up since announcing their earnings a week ago.
- SiliconWorks / LX Semicon. Only traded in South Korea. Market cap of $1.76B. PE might be around 18.
- Raydium. Only traded in Taiwan. I have no idea about their financial situation because IR is not in English.
- Synaptics. PE of 20. They just beat earnings and went up 16.5%. 

Both Novatek and Synaptics went up quite a bit after their earnings and both are less profitable than Himax. The chip shortage affects them pretty much in the same way, so we can see that Himax is a safer deal than its peers.

Why Himax will likely remain very profitable after the chip shortage is resolved:

- There is a shift in demand towards segments with high margins. Higher resolution and higher refresh rates require more complex chips which can be sold for more. In the grand scheme of things, these chips are still very cheap (around $1 per chip) so display manufacturers are willing to pay a dollar extra if they can sell their 240 Hz 8K TV for an extra $1000.
- Their TDDI technology is a clear winner in the automotive segment. They say ""The number of awarded projects is already in the dozens and still growing quickly as we speak. We expect the [automotive] TDDI volume to expand exponentially starting from this quarter."" Their overall automotive market share is increasing. So even if they have to sell each chip for less after the shortage, they can make up for it in volume. They are fabless and their biggest fixed cost are the employees, so by selling more they can keep up the profits. 
- Electric vehicles typically come with more displays than ICE vehicles, so the overall demand is getting larger as well.

It is not even clear whether the shortage will be resolved any time soon. Work-from-home demand will probably go down, but then again the demand shifts towards more sophisticated displays with increased resolution and refresh rates. A chip that handles 240 Hz refresh rate is bigger than a 60 Hz chip. And the total foundry capacity is still limited. From the earnings call: 

- ""Some design requires more sophisticated design, i.e., larger IC per panel. So we believe the demand in terms of wafer area will increase. We actually, based on internal estimates, [believe] the supply can actually decrease somehow.""
- ""The fact is that the industry, overall, there is simply no new major capacity expansion this year and next year or even second half 2023""

So demand is increasing, effective supply is decreasing, there is almost no capacity coming online before 2024 and what happens afterwards is still unknown.

&amp;#x200B;

**I. Introduction:**

Lion Electric is a manufacturer of yellow school buses, public transit buses, semi-trucks, bucket trucks, and garbage/refuse trucks. Incorporated in 2008, Lion has over [390 vehicles on the road today]( with over 7 million miles driven. They are known for having some of the highest quality commercial EV's on the market, deep connections with Amazon and the the full backing of the Canadian government. With the new Biden EV initiates, Lion is primed to take advantage of incentives in both markets.

With congress passing the bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, the US government is expecting to spend “**$39 billion in new funding** to modernize public transit and[ replace thousands of buses]( with zero-emission vehicles”. Combined with Biden now beginning to issue mandates that 50% of new vehicle sales be EV by 2030, Lion is in an **incredible position** to expand rapidly. Throw in a potential green reconciliation bill, and things get crazy fast.

You might ask ""But Lion is Canadian, how will they get US funding?"" They'll use their [brand new 900,000 square foot manufacturing facility]( in Joliet, Illinois, of course! This facility will be able to manufacture a **staggering** [20,000 vehicles]( **per year** and is expected to come online in Q4 2021, all with a 'Made in the USA' sticker. The state of Illinois is giving Lion $7.9 million in tax credits just to create this facility.

Many companies stand to benefit from the inevitable government funding that will fuel the commercial EV revolution. Proterra, Bluebird, and even Lightning eMotors will rocket as the sector rises together. But only Lion has a full catalogue of [school/transit busses, class 6/8 trucks, bucket/garbage trucks, and soon ambulances.]( Lion's TAM is monstrous, and with their new Joliet facility, as well as their new battery plant in Quebec, they are poised to become the undisputed leader in the commercial EV space.

**II. Connections:**

The CEO of Lion Electric, Marc Bédard, has been busy building connections both in the USA and Canada. While you might think their strong relationship with the Canadian government or the [Illinois state]( government might be their impressive connections, I believe Lion's relationship with the richest man in the world is most important: Jeff Bezos.

Lion has deep ties with Jeff, ""*Amazon plans to procure up to* [*2,500 all-electric Lion 6 and Lion 8 trucks*]( *from Canadian manufacturer Lion Electric by 2025.""* More importantly, Amazon has retained the option to purchase up to 20% of Lion Electric. With Biden's mandates coming in to place, Amazon is sure to use Lion to convert their class 6 &amp; 8 fleet. When this news hits, Lion's share price is going to go bonkers. I can't stress how important this relationship is.

Marc's relationship with Illinois is becoming increasingly impressive as the state becomes a hub for EV manufacturing. Rivian has set up [a massive manufacturing facility]( in the state, and Lion's new Joliet facility just happens to be right next to a massive set of Amazon distribution warehouses. Lion will no doubt take full advantage of the huge tax incentives Illinois is giving them. As of last month, U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin [met with Lion]( to discuss the future of EV growth.

As Lion builds more connections, expect to see them partner with more big names, [such as IKEA]( If retail monsters like Amazon and IKEA are choosing Lion to electrify their fleet, then surely more big names will follow. As they build relationships with smaller state and local governments, expect hundreds of announcements of orders over the next year, such as the [Green Mountain bucket truck order]( that came out last week.

**III. Advantages:**

Lion Electric has a long list of advantages over its competitors, which is one of the main reasons why their stock price has managed to hold on into key support levels during the 'SPAC attack'. These include:

* A superior product: Lion vehicles are known to have top notch quality in the industry. Competitors such as Proterra have a mixed reputation, with [many of their vehicles inoperable.]( Lion has no such PR issues.
* Killer managed team: Heavy hitters like Marc Bédard, Nicolas Brunet, François Duquette, and Brian Piern are the reason Lion forms relationships and wins over big name customers like Amazon and IKEA.
* Dual government incentives: Lion is in a unique position to take full advantage of both Canadian and USA green government incentives. Unlike Chinese EV makers who will not receive any US government support, or US companies that can't tap into Canadian support.
* Customer relations: Lion has invested heavily in customer relations and offers complete support when customers start an EV fleet of their own. They set up charging, maintenance, and are considered extremely reliable.
* Proprietary technology: Lion holds proprietary tech that allows a Lion EV fleet to [store energy during off-peak hours and feed it back into the system]( during peak hours using bi-direction chargers. This provides huge savings to customers such as school districts and is very attractive.
* Battery Production: Lion announced their $185 million CAD investment in their own battery manufacturing facility, [$100m of that paid for by the Canadian government.]( This will streamline their production capacity and reduce costs, as they plan to pump out a new battery ever 11 seconds.
* Scaled manufacturing: With their new Joliet facility launching in Q4, Lion will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles annually at full capacity. With the monstrous TAM that their full catalogue offers, they are set to become the undisputed leader of the commercial EV space. It will take years for competitors to get facilities of this scale launched, yet alone be at full capacity.

**IV** **. Projections:**

Having raised $490 million by going public, Lion has aggressive growth goals for 2022, 2023, and so on. Their preparation for rapid growth combined with the government EV push is one of my largest reasons for this investment.

|Year|Units Sold|Revenue|YoY Growth|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2022|2,475|$668M|281%|
|2023|7,580|$1.67B|206%|
|2024|18,400|$3.6B|143%|

You can find the full set of this data [on their investor presentation]( Spend 10 minutes looking at this document and you'll see that they are prepped to become an absolute beast.

If you were to call Lion Electric ambitious, that would be an understatement. Fortunately they've prepared to meet these numbers with their new Joliet facility, and rumor has it they are looking to expand into a second facility in the USA. As regular earning reports are delivered and Lion proves its mettle, larger institutions will begin taking large positions in this company.

**V** **. Catalysts:**

I wouldn't be holding such a large position in Lion if I didn't see a large string of catalysts lined up in the near future. I've tried to list them in order of stock-price impact.

1. **Amazon announcement:** With 10% of their production capacity reserved for Amazon, and Amazon [considering purchasing up to 2,500 vehicles]( it's only a matter of time until this announcement takes place.. When this happens, and even better Amazon announces taking a stake in Lion (up to 20%), the stock is going to go through the roof.
2. **Biden infrastructure**: With billions of dollars being poured into EV, the start of the commercial EV revolution is officially beginning. Knowing that they must start converting their fleets to electric, businesses, school districts, and local government will start ordering the highest quality vehicles in the market, Lion Electric vehicles.
3. **Earnings:** Lion will hold earnings [on August 13]( and earning calls for a small cap growth company are crucial. As long as Lion has shown an expected number of deliveries, their production will be validated and new money will start moving in. There is also a possibility of the Amazon announcement on this day.
4. **Big Investors**: It's only a matter of time until Cathie Woods picks up some Lion for Ark. As larger investors gain trust in Lion's projections and take positions, the company will start gaining public recognition. Remember, Lion Electric is very under the radar.
5. **Orders:** All commercial EV companies are gaining regular orders, and these announcements come out on a weekly basis. However, once a new big name (Like Amazon or IKEA) announces plans to form a Lion fleet, a huge tailwind will ensue. Unfortunately I'm not an insider so I don't know who this will be, but Biden is basically guaranteeing this will occur.
6. **New plant:** This one is based on speculation and rumor, but supposedly Lion is shopping around for a location for a second US manufacturing plant. This would be huge news and would only serve to validate their presence as the new leader in the space.
7. **Short squeeze:** The hedges went in big shorting every SPAC, regardless of their fundamentals of company strength. And they made a lot of money. Short interest for Lion is huge, and the moment of the above catalysts hits, these shorts will need to cover. You know the rest.

**VI. Current Price**

Lion Electric has a market cap of  **2.737B.** Nikola motors has a market cap of  **4.094B.** Let that sink for a moment. Lion is everything Nikola wishes it was without any of the fraud or scams, yet trades at a fraction of its valuation.

Why?

*The Spac Attack*

During the Spac craze of last year, a large number of companies went public. Many of these spacs brought healthy companies public, like Lion Electric, Proterra, and Lightning eMotors. But unfortunately, a number of them like [Nikola]( and [Lordstown]( were fraudulent scams which resulted in a terrible event... *The Spac Attack.* There was a massive rotation out of Spacs and every short seller moved in like a hawk to take advantage of the Spac name being tarnished. The ex-spacs like Lion and Proterra haven't recovered since and the [shorts are still in place](

While this sucked immensely, it has provided us an amazing opportunity to buy the legitimate ex-spacs at a massive discount. (I don't count Lucid, because they aren't at a discount.) Everything is in place for Lion to become the leader of the commercial EV space, and we get to buy it for pennies on the dollar.

Lion has actually held up pretty well despite the *Spac Attack,* managing to maintain its key supports. This is because their investors know Lion has the superior product, management, and growth prospectives. The other EV ex-spacs have suffered from issues like failing vehicles ([Like Proterra]( or doing absolutely no PR (Like Lightning eMotors.)

**VII. The Product**

Lion is known in the industry for its high quality products and customer support, and as corporations and school districts decide who to build their fleet with this will become increasingly important.

* Lion offers [7 electric truck and bus models available for purchase today.]( These include school/transit busses, Class 6/8 trucks, refuse trucks, and bucket trucks. In 2022 they are expanding to [ambulances, boom trucks, and even class 5&amp;7 trucks](
* Charging infrastructure: Lion offers full turn-key solutions for charging infrastructure and has an entire division dedicated to managing and maintaining customer projects. Lion times its vehicle deliveries with the completion of charging infrastructure installation which makes the process of moving to electric as non-disruptive as possible.
* Lion vehicles come with a telematics system called 'LionBeat' which is a full electric fleet management software system. I haven't actually gotten to play with this system myself yet, but I understand that it handles [performance, prioritization, fleet management, driver management/training, maintenance, and diagnostics.]( I think it's really exciting that Lion is developing custom software systems for their vehicles!
* In-House Batteries: At this point Lion has a partnership with BMW to handle its battery needs, but they are investing in a [5GWh battery plant located in Quebec, Canada]( to produce their cells in-house. Lion will be the first Canadian manufacturer of medium and heavy-duty vehicles to equip itself with its own automated battery pack manufacturing capability. This should really streamline their production and greatly reduce costs.
* Vehicle-To-Grid (V2G): Lion fleets act as [energy-storage systems]( that build up energy during off-hours and feed them back into the system during peak-hours to generate a daily profit. This cost-saving system is a big selling point for school districts and Lion's proprietary tech in this field is making it stand out from its competition.

Lion's [TAM]( for medium and heavy-duty urban electric vehicles is **110B** in North America. Keep in mind, Lion's entire current market cap is **less than 3B.** With its currently facility in Quebec rated for 2500 vehicles a year, and its new Joliet facility rated at 20,000 vehicles a year, Lion is going to take a massive chunk of this TAM. Since EV companies generally trade a much higher multiple of their yearly revenue, you can begin to grasp how massive this trade is.

[The Lion catalogue is primed for the EV revolution.](

**VIII. Popular Opinions**

If you take a look at the analysts, [4 out 5 rate Lion Electric a Buy]( and one as a Hold. Their average price target is $22.48, with a high estimate of $26. To be honest, I don't really care much for analysts or their price targets. Lion should be trading a multiple higher than these targets, which goes to show you how much of a deal it really is at $14.

I care more about popular investors and their influence on market perception.

* The Dumb Money crew, lead by investor Chris Camillo has turned $20,000 into well over $20 million using their unique investing style called 'Social Arbitrage'. They hold a $1 million dollar investment in Lion Electric and [did a full deep dive on the company.]( The video is from when Lion was still a spac, but the thesis holds and they still have their position.  Check the video out!
* Jim Cramer is a Lion Electric bull, having talked about it multiple times on his show. He even had the CEO Marc Bédard [on his show]( to discuss Lion's Amazon partnership. While I don't consider myself a MadMoney fan, once Lion starts meeting its projections Cramer is going to be pumping this to all older investors.
* MeetKevin, a popular investing YouTuber, is bullish on EV companies and mentions Lion Electric all the time. While he's much more focused on Tesla and Lucid, I'm expecting some good coverage from him when Lion ramps up. Also he actually has a realistic chance of becoming [the Governor of California!](
* Alex Cutler, popular overall EV bull, talks about Lion quite often and has a position. Unfortunately he got absolutely wrecked during the Spac attack. I think once the rotation back into small cap EV occurs he'll be getting a lot more spotlight, and his appreciation of Lion is sure to help us moon once we start trending.

While Lion Electric is still very under the radar, already having a number of big YouTubers on board is going to help Lion's market cap immensely when one or more of the above catalysts hit the news. I would still be as equally heavy in my trade if Lion had no support from popular influencers, but exposure from people like Chris Camillo is only going to help.

**IX. My Position**

This DD wouldn't be complete if I didn't put my money where my mouth is. In the spirit of WSB and to emphasis my conviction on this trade, I've put my entire portfolio into long-term OOTM call options.

I own 600 $20 call options expiring 1/20/23, valued at $2.45 each for a total of $147,000. This is my entire life savings accumulated through work and investment profits. I would be holding these contracts to expiration and expect to make 2-3 million dollars off of them, perhaps more.

Why did I buy leaps? Simply put, they provide me much more leverage than owning equity while still giving me a comfortable time buffer for the above catalysts to make this stock run. Since Lion was at $22 within the last month and has an ATH of $35, I consider the chance of them expiring out of the money extremely small. When Lion reached $22 last month my portfolio was worth almost $400k, but these diamond hands ain't selling.

[My life savings, all in on Lion.](

**X. Conclusion**

In my opinion, Lion Electric is almost the perfect trade. With a huge tailwind of government incentives on the way, big name clients such as Amazon, and a massive new facility about to come online, I genuinely see this stock going to the moon. As the United States moves to meet its 50% 2030 EV mandate, corporations and local/state government will be racing to get ahead of the game. Lion will be ready to supply their entire fleets.

As legacy auto-makers continue to fall farther and farther behind, a few key US names stand to rise above and take advantage of the coming EV government spending spree. Rivian and Workhorse on small commercial EV, Bluebird and Proterra on busses, and Tesla beginning to produce semis.

But only one company has the catalogue, connections, and production to become the true King of the commercial EV jungle. Lion Electric.

HOOD 70c 9/24. RH might be a POS but this is about money.**

My plan to post these consistently fell apart a bit. Anyways the last call for SPY 439c 7/23 betting on $440 was on the dime (Actually within a dime) and ended up being fairly profitable after some averaging down. The put credit spreads not so much but that's life. However this trading method (Modeling out Delta Hedging) works significantly better on heavily options driven equities which brings me to the recent IPO of Robinhood (HOOD).

First off, forget what you think about the company or Vlad Tenev. This is about making money and I don't give a fuck about the emotional component. Second, I've explained the options/underlying mechanic and some explanation of what I'm doing in past posts. We're looking at delta hedging to predict what prices are more likely. Go read it there if you're still confused.

**Options rolled out last week** and have been very influential on the movement of HOOD. This is the model of the options chain (weighted for Delta **Δ**) on 4 AUG close.

[HOOD ΔWeighted Model for 4 AUG 21](

Two neat things here. First, $70 strike has the most significant options concentration and therefore has the most pull on the underlying. Interestingly HOOD closed at $70.39 on 4 AUG which is right on the money. Second, the options concentration is almost entirely from $50 to $70. After news of insiders selling shares broke premarket 5 AUG, HOOD declined heavily but bounced off a low of $50.85  which is the lower bound created by the options. Given this and overall options volume, it would be fair to conclude options/delta hedging is influential here.

Over the weekend I updated the model for the new strikes and expirations added.

[HOOD ΔWeighted Model for Week Ending 13 AUG 21](

* Call buying on $70 is still elevated and is the most significant strike here. Based on that alone, I like the probability of a gamma squeeze towards $70. Enough said.
* There's a bound between $50-75 that the spot price should stay within. All of the options are tightly grouped in there and are pulling the spot around.
* The even Put/Call ratio on $75 creates an interesting setup. Overall, the number of contracts on $75 is high and should therefore be a significant strike and attract the spot price. However let's take a look at  net Δ (Call+Put).

[HOOD ΔWeighted Net Model for Week Ending 13 AUG 21](

Because of the even Put/Call ratio, the net Δ is slightly negative and nonsignificant. Therein lies a problem. To say $75 is  Δ neutral assumes all those options are being held/hedged by one entity which would therefore have neutral directional risk and no need to hedge much at all. This isn't entirely realistic since different market makers are writing these contracts and each hold different directional positions. But the hedging effect would balance out on an aggregate level because hedging calls and puts balance out. My brain is too smooth to have a hard answer either way so I'm not confident enough to bet anything on it.

**Positions: HOOD 70c 9/24**

My one concern is the insane implied volatility. As of Friday close, IV was sitting at 235% which is insane and options premiums certainly reflect that. You can be completely correct about direction and price and still lose when Vega bends you over. But I didn't get here being risk averse so fuck it.

ROIC: 7% (Industry Avg: -23.3%)

Altman Z-score: 4.2

Average Bond Rating: A+

R&amp;D Spending: 26.21% of Revenue (Industry Avg: 18.7%)

Hi apes, so Bristol Myers-Squibb is a generic pharmaceuticals corporation, and a boring boomer stock. So why would you buy this low beta snooze fest? High Dividends, good value, rising revenue, and more.

So first we start with basic reasons why you should buy into the health sector, demand literally never goes away. You could take out a mortgage to buy a play on oil futures, but you'd be at the mercy of some fat Saudi Arabian man halfway across the world, but with health, it's a market that has constant and steady demand with no catalysts that can diminish it in any significant way. You might also consider it because of the potential of the delta variant, and how health stocks may be one of the few sectors resistant to it.

Now onto the company itself, if you've seen pharmaceutical ads in any capacity you are probably familiar with [Eliquis]( [Revlimid]( and [Opdivo]( all of which generate over $1 billion dollars in revenue for BMY. Along with 41 other brands of drugs it produces,  BMY has large enough diversity to hedge itself through the amount and variety of products it offers.





BMY is also incredibly financially strong, since even though it has a debt to equity percentage of 125% (brought on by financing of its acquisition of cancer and immunology drug maker Celgene), it has a current ratio of 1.54, a quick ratio of 1.21, and an outstanding covered ratio of 6.13.

📷

R&amp;D is an important metric to consider when buying pharma stocks and BMY is in the the top 10 of spenders when it comes to percentage of revenue allocated. In order to perpetuate growth, companies need to consistently pump cash into research new drugs, which obviously comes with risk of failure. This puts BMY in a category of pharma stocks that are financially stable enough to warrant a buy on that merit, while also having robust spending in their R&amp;D department to facilitate growth. This spending continues to grow, this being demonstrated by the near 40% increase in R&amp;D spending within the last year by BMY. Forecasts predict the company will grow by around 7% a year for the next 3-4 years and forward EPS growth expected to reach close to 20%.







&gt;""Bristol Myers' Opdivo -- a cancer medicine -- and anticoagulant Eliquis (the rights of which Bristol Myers shares with Pfizer) will both be among the **top five best-selling drugs in the world by 2026,** according to the research company Evaluate Pharma""  [Source](

&amp;#x200B;

While you may not buy for the dividend, it will definitely make you want to stay. With a 2.88% yield and growth rate of 9% over the past year, it is a nice bonus to an already amazing stock.

Now lets talk value, BMY has a current P/E Ration of 10.08 (9.09 FWD) compared to the industry average of 24.01 (23.47 FWD). Already with head start,  BMY has an EV/EBIDTA of 9.75 (7.48 FWD) compared to the industry average 20.29 (16.36 FWD). I could go on, but you get the main idea that in all value metrics BMY is beating the industry (and market). With the recent acquisition of Celgene undoubtedly adding more value, it's undeniably undervalued.

Upside for BMY is crazy, to bring it to the industry average P/E ratio would bring the price per share to around $179 at current EPS estimates ($7.49), an over 250% increase. While this may be wildly optimistic, even an increase to a P/E ratio of 15 would bring the price to around $112.

**TLDR:**

Bristol Myers:Squibb is a great, financially stable pharma company with good growth opportunity, tons of value, and dividend growth. The overall consensus from analysts is buy for a reason. BMY is a great way to hedge your portfolio from any volatility in the market (Beta of 0.59) while still getting more gains than any other comparable hedge.

Position: 15 Shares @ $67.76 (I'm broke so this is 34% of my portfolio)

What’s poppin’ bull gang, Flux here with your weekly Historical Post Earnings Moves spreadsheet! We’ve got meme week this week, so expect extra volatility alongside some absolutely stupid price action. I hope you all managed to close some profits last week during the chop. **$FSLY strangles returned 60% while binary options would’ve done around 300%. $ROKU strangles more or less broke even. $UBER and $LYFT both moved in tandem resulting in solid returns for most collateral plays.** I personally played $NKLA (even though I said not to) and lost 19$, while also getting punished by $SMG and losing a small chunk of premium. Managed to close out the week at roughly breakeven, which is honestly a blessing.  Will need to re-evaluate my plan going into this week! That being said, I want you all to be careful. Meme week is often not worth trading, and it may be wise to play the sell side if you’re really looking to scratch the itch. Similar to last week, if you wish to track my trades and try them out for yourself, feel free to check out the community links on my profile! Let’s get into it.

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**]( Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&amp;nbsp;

- **$APPS has very expensive options.** Options are pricing in a 14% move, yet Digital Turbine only moves 8% historically. We can abuse this by selling a straddle or strangle and raking in those juicy premiums! The same holds true for $BIDU. Options are pricing in nearly 6%, while historically we get a move of around 2%. In this case, I would be a little more conservative when playing $BIDU, since it’s a Chinese stock, and we all saw how those fared earlier this month. Regardless, the premiums are there should we choose to play.

&amp;nbsp;

- **Sample sizes are small this week. This is both a blessing and a curse.** Many companies who report have only recently gone public, meaning we don’t have our standard 20+ data points to draw conclusions from. For companies with less than a year of ERs under their belts, I wouldn’t look to the historical moves as a reliable metric. That being said, this leads to opportunity. Because some of these companies are so young, it’s going to be extremely hard for market makers to price their options efficiently and put a price tag on each companies potential “growth”. What is a good metric of growth and guidance for Coinbase? What about AirBnB? Literally nobody knows, meaning there’s the potential to make some money due to pricing inefficiencies.

&amp;nbsp;

- **Expect muted volatility out of meme stocks. Sell side reigns supreme.** Despite what the apes are hoping for, I really doubt we see any huge moves out of the memes. There’s no squeeze factor, no new fundamental changes, and no reason to see insane moves. We even got a sneak preview of this last week with $CLNE where we literally closed flat post earnings. Options prices are jacked up, and you’re just going to get robbed by theta gang if you go long. The best way to trade these tickers would be on the sell side, with OTM credit spreads or strangles. The premiums are extremely nice, and the moves will likely be weak. Keep in mind, this is just a guess, so there’s a chance I’m entirely wrong and get blown out, but I really feel like meme season is over, at least for now. MMs are going to be laughing all the way to the bank with these ones.

&amp;nbsp;

All that being said, this week is shaping up to be awkward, so I’ll likely look to pull the trigger on some plays at the very last minute. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.

#Summary and Conclusion

Meme week up ahead! It’s probably best to sit this week out as it’s extremely difficult to trade with such a limited set of data and such a volatile pool of companies. If you really need to make some plays, look to prioritize the sell side, as those will give us the best risk to reward on our trades. If you see any appealing plays I’ve missed, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet]( to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment!

Everyone is hyping EV/batteries in expectation for the gigantic titty of all government titties: the $1T infrastructure bill. 

So calls on “growth” tickers like LEV, MVST, PTRA, etc gonna print right?

Remember when the USPS had a contract up for grabs to transition their vehicles to EV? And you retards thought WKHS was the sure play?

Wha happahn???

The US government happened. 

Workhorse employs fewer than 100 people. Oshkosh employs more than 16,000 people. 

The US government doesn’t give a flying fuck about “market disrupters”. They have infinite money and if Workhorse comes along and makes waves in the private sector and produces long-term reliable vehicles, the US government might throw them a contract someday. 

There is no EV moat. It’s a car with a battery. Your mom has an EV startup. 

There *are* car companies though. GM. Ford. Chrysler. 

These companies employ hundreds of thousands of American workers. Not a hundred. Hundreds of thousands. 

So, like the Oshkosh thing, the safe bet is on the huge automakers getting the lion’s share of whatever contracts come up. At least that’s my opinion. 

If there’s one thing the federal government loves, it’s companies that employ American workers. And the big automakers in the US employ a shit-ton of people. I’m curious to hear what y’all think. 

TL;DR: the US government is not going to let an EV start-up fuck up major auto companies’ market share and risk layoffs of workers. You were retarded to bet on WKHS. You may just be similarly retarded betting on LEV/PTRA. I think MVST is a reasonable bet tho.

Maybe it’s because of the reports that need to come in, and maybe they’ll give something that will help the stock rise, and maybe even rise high.

Pluto TV alone would be worth at least $18 billion if it traded at Roku's multiples, almost half of ViacomCBS' enterprise value of ~$39.3 billion.

Although Pluto TV is considerably smaller than Roku, it is growing faster and is forecasted to surpass Roku's active users this year.

Streaming subscribers are also growing at a high rate, ViacomCBS added 12M subscribers in the first half of the year and reached 42M global subscribers.

The decline in traditional TV viewing is a headwind, but growth in streaming and Pluto TV will more than compensate for it.

A conservative DCF Model gives us a fair value of $65.79 per share, 58.5% above the current price of $41.50.


The entire traditional media industry is in a difficult transformational period, with consumers shifting away from traditional TV to streaming, companies are being forced to adapt or slowly wither away. ViacomCBS (VIAC) is no different, even though the merger put it in a much stronger position to compete in streaming, it still faces a few difficult years ahead.


As revenues from traditional TV ads and subscribers inevitably fall, growth from streaming subscriptions and Pluto TV will be essential to offset this fall. Streaming revenues are forecasted to be $4.3 billion this year, 15% of total revenues, with a growth of 67% y-o-y, far ahead of the initial guidance given by management.

Source: 2020 Q4 earnings presentation ViacomCBS

Pluto TV has proven to be a key asset and an invaluable acquisition. As linear TV ad spending shifts to connected TV, Pluto TV stands to capture a sizable share of the market with its fast-growing user base. The company has already grown from $70 million in revenue in 2018 to over $1 billion expected in 2021, more than doubling revenues for four consecutive quarters.

Streaming subscriptions have not been slacking either. After rebranding CBS All Access to Paramount+ last March, ViacomCBS added 12M subscribers in the first half of 2021, and with a Paramount+ planned launch in Europe in 2022, the segment is forecasted to experience outstanding growth in the following years.

*Pluto TV*
Pluto TV is a free ad-supported internet TV service, similar to The Roku (ROKU) Channel. It is available as an app in most smart TVs, iOS and Android, and can also be accessed through the web Pluto.tv.

Pluto TV active users


Source: 2020 Q4 earnings presentation ViacomCBS

Viacom acquired the company for $340 million in January 2019. Since then, Pluto TV has quintupled its active users and more than tripled its ARPU with no signs of stopping.

Although ViacomCBS does not report revenues separately for Pluto TV, CEO Bob Bakish commented in the latest earnings call: ""we now, in fact, expect Pluto TV to comfortably generate more than $1 billion in revenue this year.""

Applying the current 2021 ~x18 sales multiple of Roku to Pluto TV gives us a valuation of at least $18 billion. At the current price of $41.50 per share, VIAC is worth ~$27 billion and has ~$12.3 billion in net debt, for a total enterprise value of ~$39.3 billion.

While the multiples of Roku may be deemed to be too high by some, it is what the market is currently valuing it at. I am using the same multiples since both companies are in the same industry and Pluto TV is actually growing faster. In 2021 Q2, Pluto's revenue grew 169% while Roku's platform revenue grew 117%.

In addition, if we remove the hardware revenue component from Roku, which has negative margins, Roku is trading at ~23x times 2021 platform revenue, giving us a valuation of at least $23 billion for Pluto TV.

Pluto's revenue grew 169% in the quarter. This tremendous expansion of the business has been driven by growth in users’ engagement and sell through. Domestic watch time per MAU increased 45% year-over-year in Q2, and Pluto TV domestic ARPU more than doubled year-over-year

It also has a sizable investment in content, with $15 billion spent in content in 2020.

VIAC's management forecasted 65M-75M global streaming subscribers by the end of 2024, but the excellent performance of the launch of Paramount+ in the US shows that this target was extremely conservative.

ViacomCBS streaming subscribers

Source: 2020 Q4 earnings presentation ViacomCBS

The recently announced partnership with Sky to launch Paramount+ in Europe in 2022 will also considerably boost subscriber growth. Analysts have already increased their subscribers' forecast and are now expecting 66M subscribers by the end of 2022. At this rate, we could see 80M subscribers by the end of 2023.

Streaming subscriptions revenue is on track to reach close to $2 billion in revenue this year (70% y-o-y growth), and this does not include the advertising revenue from the ad-supported Paramount+ subscription. This is quite small compared to giants like Netflix, but its fast growth will be more than enough to offset the decline in revenue from the traditional business.

Traditional Business
When thinking about the traditional business, two things come to mind: secular decline and cannibalization. As consumers continue to move away from linear TV; advertising, affiliate, and licensing revenues will inevitably fall. The next few years will be especially hard for earnings growth as ViacomCBS has to increase its spending to grow its streaming business, adding pressure to margins.

Source: 2021 Q2 Trending Schedules ViacomCBS

Some investors might be rightfully concerned that streaming will simply replace the current linear TV revenues with lower margins as consumers just shift from one platform to another. ViacomCBS' management recently put those concerns to rest as it claimed that streaming will lead to both higher ARPUs and user reach.

Streaming presents a compelling market opportunity for two key reasons; one, unit upside where streaming allows for a greater addressable base of viewers go linear and two, ARPU upside because streaming ARPU's have a more compelling long-term trajectory than linear. The unit upside is especially true internationally where streaming allows us to reach beyond the Pay TV universe, which has limited penetration in many international markets.

Source: 2021 Q1 earnings call transcript ViacomCBS

The traditional business may be in decline, but it still has revenues comparable to those of Netflix, which will allow ViacomCBS to compete in content spending as its streaming business matures.

Using a DCF Model to value ViacomCBS
Current analyst estimates guide for flat operating income, flat free cash flow, and revenue growth of ~3% until 2023. After 2023, I am forecasting that ViacomCBS will start to temper its investment in content and start growing free cash flow again, with a long-term earnings growth rate of 3%. Here are the assumptions of the model:

Operating expenses will remain as 22.5% of revenues, this is consistent with the average of the last three years.
Content expenses will grow so that operating income and free cash flow remain flat until 2023. After 2023, content spending will start to slow down.
					

For reference, changing the terminal EBIT growth rate would give us the following values per share:

0% growth: $40.07
1% growth: $46.34
2% growth: $54.55
4% growth: $82.09
5% growth: $107.88

As you can see, ViacomCBS is currently being priced like a company that will never grow its earnings. While I do agree that the next 3-5 years will likely see no or little earnings growth as the bulk of the transition to streaming takes place, I find it highly improbable that earnings will remain stagnant forever.

Conclusion
The market is not recognizing ViacomCBS' true value. The focus on short-term earnings pressure is overshadowing the long-term growth that will come from Pluto TV and streaming. Paramount+ is growing considerably faster than initially expected and Pluto TV has a leadership position in the high-growth connected TV market.

ViacomCBS is a buy for the long-term, as it is the most undervalued media entertainment company in the market. The next 3-5 years will be a transition period with flat earnings growth, but the investment in streaming will pay off and generate strong returns for long-term-oriented investors.",Roku Shows How Undervalued ViacomCBS Is,75,7

Like many of you, I hold positions in two great companies that have turned out not to be great stocks; CRSR and RKT. While many WSB favorites have what we would call “bad charts”, more than any others, CRSR and RKT have… strange charts… that actually look remarkably similar.

&amp;#x200B;



&amp;#x200B;



&amp;#x200B;

These stocks both trade like they have weights tied to them where any time they rise they are pulled back down. At the same time, they never consistently make lower lows. In the case of Corsair, we all know why this is: Eagletree. Corsair gets dozens and dozens of DDs on this sub and the top comment on any DD will be “yeah but Eagletree”. For those who don’t know, Eagletree owns a majority stake in Corsair and is constantly selling shares which is the reason for Corsair’s strange chart.

I’ve made this post to bring up the discussion of why the exact same thing may be going on with RKT. It seems extremely obvious, and yet I’ve never heard it mentioned in the dozens of RKT discussions I’ve read on this site (which has led me to having a large and painful position in the stock). **For those who have zero patience and only skim and read the bold parts: it seems obvious that RKT founder Dan Gilbert is applying the same downward pressure on RKT as Eagletree is on Corsair.**

As of March it was said Dan Gilbert owned 1.9 billion shares of RKT. Some quick math of share price and RKT’s market cap puts the number of total shares at 2.4 billion. This means Dan Gilbert owns 75% of RKT. And just think about it. Dan Gilbert is 59 years old. He has recently had a stroke which badly affected him. He wants to do humanitarian and philanthropic work. He wants to do what every billionaire wants which is to work on his legacy and do something more rewarding than obsess over his company’s share price.

I don’t know anything and I’m happy to be told why I’m wrong by someone much smarter than me. **But it seems obvious that Dan Gilbert is selling huge amounts of shares; crushing the RKT share price in the exact same manner as Corsair (CRSR).** We all know the fundamentals are great. Huge profits. The lowest PE ratio on the market. Huge growth. Housing boom. I’m not oblivious to the bear cases. Housing market peaking. The race to the bottom with UWMC. But just look at UWMC price action. The two stocks trade similarly but UWMC has a very normal chart of uptrends and downtrends. **RKT constantly ends up in sideways trends just like Corsair. We know why this is the case with Corsair and that same reason would make perfect sense for RKT.**

I would love everyone’s thoughts. If the stock doesn’t do well on earnings Thursday I will probably give up and sell at a loss.

The real breadwinner for FUBO will come in the form of its expected sportsbook/gambling business. Seeking to incorporate a betting platform onto their streaming service will send revenue through the moon.

TTCF entered Target at the end of Q1 and smashed earnings without the boost of Target sales.  They had the best frozen food launch in Target's history and have a full quarter of Target sales. 

TTCF has now entered Kroger and will continue to added to more Kroger locations. 

NO short story here bitches, but it is shorted. 


Super low IV, IV in the 50%'s unheard of in meme stocks They have an absolute Chad of a CEO who has worked in food business for over 35 years and his daughter is creative designer of the food products

I'm no Wolfy but this has all the ingredients of a perfect ground floor meme stock with disgustingly low IV​

The Brand

Tattooed Chef is a plant-based food brand. They are available in stores like Target, Walmart, Costco, and Sam's Club. The company is entirely vertically integrated which gives them a massive edge of the competition. They have been building manufacturing infrastructure since 2010. This company has great growth potential and is rapidly expanding. You might be thinking to yourself right now I'm tired of this plant based shit I don't even care if the burger is still Moo'ing on the plate, but hang with me this industry is experiencing huge growth as the younger generations eat this stuff up.

​

Finances

For full year 2021, Tattooed Chef updated its guidance and expects:

Revenue in the range of $235 million to $242 million, an increase of 58 to 63% compared to 2020. This guidance excludes any revenue contribution from the Karsten facility which is currently not in operation. The Company expects to update guidance when production begins at that facility in the coming months. Gross margin in the range of 20% to 25% Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $2 million to $4 million TTCF has a current market cap of 1.89B Insiders own 38% of the company​

Advertising and Social Media Presence

They've spent like 0 dollars on advertising. They developed a plan to hit 2 billion impressions in the form of 6 and 16 second videos in the first 8 months of 2021. This is the first time they're spending advertising dollars and they have already built up a loyal following. You can see on Twitter posts of pictures of local Target frozen shelves being out of TTCF stock. Search Twitter for $TTCF and you'll see them. Also the comments on TTCF's official twitter account have stuff like ""yo get the product in my target please, it's always out of stock"" and ""when you gonna be in Europe please"". They have a very popular product that is flying off the shelves. Before 2021, their only sales team was the CEO and his daughter. Now, they've hired marketing teams to get them into more retail stores, like an ex-Coca Cola national sales manager to boost marketing.

Expansion into Overseas Markets

Europe has a strong demand for their products, as plant-based proteins are growing in popularity. TTCF has 2 manufacturing plants, one in California and one in Italy. It's cheaper for them to ship ingredients from Italy to the US for their US operations. So they're looking to hire sales in Europe to get TTCF in stores there. They have already entered into Costco UK and are expanding over the continent

​

Short Interest and Low IV

TTCF has very low IV and SI of over 30%. It is currently one of the most shorted stocks on the market. This is a stock with solid fundamentals and rapid growth. In my opinion calls are not priced accordingly and you seeing this early could get in on the ground floor while IV is still laughably low. Volume on it is low as well and the float is on the smaller side. If you are able to get in while IV is low this thing could take off.

ALRIGHT RETARDS. This is the only $SAVA DD you'll need to read to understand what's going on with Alzheimer's research. I broke it up into 3 parts so your tiny attention spans would be able to read it over time. This is the first part, the part none of you think is necessary: **Necessary Background Knowledge.**

## TLDR:

1. Alzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia. 50 Million people worldwide and 5.8 Million in the United States have Alzheimer’s. There is no cure for Alzheimer’s and no way to definitively diagnose it. Untreated, people with Alzheimer’s always get worse.
2. Current treatments (Aduhelm, Aricept) suck as they only **slow the decline** of patients with Alzheimer’s. Current diagnostic methods suck for Alzheimer’s because they involve a multistep process of family interviews, brain scans, or memory/cognition tests.

# Alzheimer's Disease Fact Sheet

* Alzheimer's is the **most common cause of dementia**.
* Alzheimer's is a **progressive disease**, where dementia symptoms gradually worsen over a number of years. [\[source\]](
* The risk of Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia increases with age. Alzheimer's is the **sixth-leading cause of death in the United States**. [\[source\]](
* **6.2 Million Americans** have Alzheimer's. By 2050, the number of people age 65 and older with Alzheimer’s dementia is projected to reach **12.7 million in the US**. As the size and proportion of the U.S. population aged 65 and older continue to increase, the number of Americans with Alzheimer’s or other dementias will grow. This number will escalate rapidly in coming years, as the population of Americans age 65 and older is projected to grow from 55 million in 2019 to 88 million by 2050. The baby boom generation has already begun to reach age 65 and beyond, the age range of greatest risk of Alzheimer’s dementia. [\[source\]](
* More than 18.5 Billion hours of informal care were provided by Alzheimer's and other dementia caregivers in 2018, a contribution to the nation valued at nearly $234 billion. The total lifetime cost of care for someone with dementia was estimated at $350,174 in 2018 dollars. The costs associated with family care make up 70 percent of lifetime dementia care costs. [\[source\]](
* **Alzheimer's has no cure**. Treatments include Aducanumab, and Aricept (cholinesterase inhibitor). Aricept is an old drug that can **temporarily slow the worsening of dementia symptoms** and improve quality of life for those with Alzheimer's and their caregivers [\[source\]](  Aducanumab, recently approved by the FDA, is [highly controversial]( as it was approved **without indication that it improved cognition in patients**.
* **Alzheimer’s is best diagnosed early**, since all treatments are for early-to-moderate Alzheimer’s [\[article\]]( Doctors [diagnose Alzheimer's disease]( using in person tests administered to assess memory and thinking skills. Laboratory and imaging tests can rule out other potential causes or help the doctor better identify the disease causing dementia symptoms. Alzheimer's disease is only diagnosed with complete certainty after death, when microscopic examination of the brain reveals the Amyloid plaques and Tau tangles.

# Amyloid Hypothesis and Tau Tangles

Beta-amyloid is a sticky compound that accumulates in the brain, disrupting communication between brain cells and eventually killing them. Some researchers believe that flaws in the processes governing production, accumulation or disposal of beta-amyloid are the primary cause of Alzheimer’s. This theory is called “the amyloid hypothesis.” [\[source\]]( Amyloid plaques are hard, insoluble accumulations of beta-amyloid proteins that clump together between the nerve cells (neurons) in the brains of Alzheimer’s disease patients. [\[source\]](

Aducanumab (Biogen) and Donanemab (Eli Lilly) are monoclonal antibodies that target beta-amyloid in soluble and insoluble form. These drugs seek to remove amyloid plaques from the brain. Unfortunately, while they have been shown to reduce amyloid from the brain, they have not been shown to improve cognition. Both drugs are administered via IV infusion. [\[source\]](

Tau tangles, another hallmark of Alzheimer's, are insoluble twisted fibers found inside the brain's cells. These tangles consist primarily of [a protein called tau]( In Alzheimer's disease, the tau protein is abnormal and misfolded.

# Cassava Sciences, Simufilam, and SavaDX

Cassava Sciences (SAVA) is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company. Its mission is to develop a treatment and diagnostic for Alzheimer’s disease.

Simufilam is a proprietary, small molecule oral (pill) drug that restores the normal shape and function of altered Filamin A (FLNA), a scaffolding protein, in the brain. Altered FLNA in the brain disrupts the normal function of neurons, leading to Alzheimer’s pathology, neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation.  Importantly, Simufilam does not attempt to target amyloid-beta and remove it from the brain. Simufilam is protected by patents running till 2037.

SavaDx is an investigational blood test to detect Alzheimer’s disease. SavaDX is protected by trade secrets.

[A sneak peek into tomorrow's DD](

I believe Simufilam has the potential to be one of the best selling drugs in pharmaceutical history. Stay tuned for the next DD!

**Let me start off with few basic things. ViacomCBS has had a great Q2 with some key highlights:**

* Revenue: 6.56B (est 6.52B)
* Adj EPS: 0.97 (est 0.96)
* \+6.5M streaming subscribers (42M total between P+, Showtime etc)
* \+2.8M PlutoTV MAUs (52.3M total)
* \+45% watch time per user (Roku's decreased)
* \+24% ad revenue yoy
* \+9% affiliate revenue yoy
* \+92% (!) streaming revenue yoy. In comparison, $NFLX +19.4% stream revenue yoy (Revenue growth stagnating and is flattening out)
* Paramount+ [launches]( in Australia and New Zealand on 11th August (in 3 days yey!!!!!)
* Paramount+ [officially launches in Europe]( in 2022, expands in South America

**ViacomCBS Paramount+ is experiencing unprecedented subscriber growth in post-pandemic quarters Q1 and Q2 compared with slowing down subscriber growth in streaming industry**, where net Adds in Q2 (6.5 million) exceeded Q1 (6.0 million), which I believe nobody expected even in their most bullish scenarios. 

[Global Subscriber Count for major streaming giants \(US + rest of the world combined\)](

Key highlight is that Paramount Plus Quarter-over-Quarter growth is in 20% range in the first 2 quarters of 2021, while Netflix is experiencing a 1.3% subscriber growth, so basically becoming a value stock instead of being a growth stock. Also Disney's subscriber growth is slowing down dramatically as well to 7.67% average growth for the Q1 and Q2 2021 quarters. 

**Diversity of Content and Subscription price**

[Subscribers, Subscription price and Content Diversity](

In conclusion, ViacomCBS Paramount+  is expanding into more countries in 2022 with total of 60 countries including Europe, Australia, etc, and Paramount+ subscriber growth has not yet reached its peak as Yellowstone [prequel]( and potentially Yellowstone itself including Season 4 is coming to Paramount+ later this year; Also recent $900 million deal with South Park creators with 14 South Park films in next 7 years streaming exclusively on Paramount Plus where 2 South Park movies coming later this year!!!! ALSO ALSO, Star trek new seasons and tv shows coming this year, as well as Avatar The Last Airbender new [shows]( and new movies coming exclusively to P+, as original creators, Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, are joining Nickelodeon as co-chief creative officers of Avatar Studios. ALL OF THIS SHOWS ViacomCBS commitment to P+ and make it the TOP 3  or even Number 1 streaming platform globally

Therefore $VIAC should actually be valued like a growth stock with P/E = 15-20 which equals to $80-$100, instead of 7.79 P/E [currently]( While $NFLX should be actually a Value stock or Shiittyy stock with P/E of 10, instead of P/E=[53.9](

Also Paramount+ is the cheapest in the industry with only 4.99$ and has huge amount of quality content (CBS, Nickelodeon, BET, SHOWTIME, Smithsonian, Paramount Network, MTV, Comedy Central) while the rest of streaming platforms subscription is like around 8$-10$ and does not have enough good content to justify it. Also who da faq still subscribed to NFLX? THere is like nothing to watch there...

PROVE ME WRONG! Would love to hear your comments.

1. Many businesses in US depend on China. We may not be familiar with the names of the many SMEs in US that depends on or benefits from China’s cheaper production costs but we most likely have heard of the big names such as Tesla, Apple, Gillette, Levi’s, Barbie dolls, Ray Bans, Nike, Converse etc and the list goes on and on.
2. Game theory. US is not likely to fuck themselves, their economy and China is not going to fuck themselves either, exiting from such a large market. Both sides are going to suffer the loss of an unprecedented number of jobs and the effect of which is an unimaginable hit in their economies. The best outcome for both cums from co-operation.
3. If for any reason that the size of their genitals matters more to them than their economies and people, we must remember that the rest of world gets fucked as well. This shit could cause a recession that spreads faster than a STD in college, so that’s additional protection (pun fully intended). If all else fails, maybe the UN may just send Samuel L Jackson down as The Negotiator to diffuse the tensions. 
4. With all that being said, if push comes to shove. Imo for a worst case scenario, they may just go into a “you-do-yours, I-do-mine” mindset and maybe China stocks get delisted from US stock exchange.

1. Spending is politically popular. Politicians are only focused on the next election, whether it be a House or Senate seat, or even the Presidency. The level of deficit spending the US currently engages in would not be possible unless the Fed agrees to purchase the issuance by Treasury. While the Fed may call this QE, it is not. This is monetizing deficits (or money printing) because the Fed is buying new Treasury issuance from a broker dealer immediately after it buy them from Treasury auctions (for those who don’t know broker deals are required to bid on Treasury auctions). Janet Yellen wants JPow to buy as much Treasury bonds as possible as the market does not want this negative yielding asset (it is negative yielding because of high inflation currently). This is seen through the 120Bn in monthly purchases (80Bn treasury bonds, 40Bn MBS). 

2. Biden has said publicly he wishes to elevate women or people of color. JPow is neither of those. He is a 68 year old white dude with years of Wall Street experience as MP at the Carlyle Group. The Carlyle Group is a private equity firm founded by David Rubenstein in the mid 1980s. 

3. JPow is trying to simp for the job. I have watched JPow for many years and have noticed recently he has changed his tune. He now seems to care about regulating Wall Street, climate change, and income inequality. These views were absent during the Trump administration. JPow has also expressed an interest in running the economy hot (with high inflation) to ensure a full job recovery. This directly contradicts his actions in 2018 where he was only interested in raising interest rates at the first sign of inflation. 

4. Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, shares many of the same views as Progressives. She is a woman and a Democrat, where JPow is a Republican. Most importantly, she is publicly calling for the Fed to adopt a digital Dollar, which is in direct conflict with her colleagues. Brainard joined the Fed in 2012 (the same time as JPow) and has a good relationship with Janet Yellen. Under Brainard’s leadership the Fed would be less likely to taper, if at all. This would allow the Fed to continue to monetize deficits which would allow for more politically popular spending.

I have no positions in the market other than a SPAC I am going to redeem. The rest of my assets are in cash. JPow will be told whether he has the job in September, although I am still staying on the sidelines after being burned in Chinese stocks.",Jerome Powell Will Not Be Renominated As Fed Chairman,594,14

**Preamble**

Hedge Funds are a controversial breed of companies. On one hand, you have [Michael Burry’s Scion Capital returning 489%]( shorting the housing market and on the other hand, you have [Melvin Capital losing 53%]( of its investment value in 1 month following them shorting GameStop. Adding to this, most hedge funds have an eye-watering 2 and 20 fee structure -&gt; What this means is that they will take 2% of your investment value and 20% of your profits every year as management fees \[1\].

Even with these significant risk factors and hefty fees, the total assets managed by Hedge Funds have grown year on year and is [now over $3.8 Trillion]( Given that you need to be an institutional or accredited investor to invest directly in a hedge fund \[2\], it begs the question

**Do Hedge funds beat the market?**

**Data**

The individual performance data of hedge funds are extremely hard to get \[3\]. For this analysis, I would be using the Barclay Hedge Fund Index that calculates the average return \[4\] of 5,878 Hedge Funds. The data is available from 1997.

This dataset was also used by [American Enterprise Institute in their analysis]( so the data must be accurate. All the data used in this analysis is shared as a Google sheet at the end.

**Result**

[ ](

S&amp;P500 has beaten the hedge funds summarily with it returning a whopping 222% more than the hedge fund over the last 24 years \[5\]. This difference becomes even more drastic if you consider the last 10 years. During 2011-2020, SPY has returned 265% vs the average hedge fund returns of just 60%.

This awesome visualization by AEI shows the enormous difference in returns over the last 10 years.

[ ](

If you are wondering about the impact of this on the average investor (who will not be able to invest in a Hedge fund due to the stringent capital requirements), these above returns correlate directly with the returns of [Fund of Funds (FOF)]( FOFs usually invest in a wide variety of Hedge funds and do not have the capital requirements required by a normal Hedge fund so that anyone can invest in it.

The catch here is that you will be paying the management fee for both FOFs as well as the Hedge Funds. This implies that your net return would be even lower than directly investing in the Hedge Fund. This becomes apparent as if you consider the last 24 years, on average FOFs (Barclay Fund of Funds index), returned 233.1% (\~390% less than avg Hedge Fund) vs SPY returning 846%!

**Warren Buffet’s take of Hedge Funds**

In 2007, Warren Buffet had entered into a famous bet that an unmanaged, low-cost S&amp;P 500 stock index fund would out-perform an actively managed group of high-cost hedge funds over the ten-year period from 2008 to 2017 when performance was measured net of fees, costs, and expenses. The result was similar to the above with S&amp;P 500 beating all the actively managed funds by a significant margin. This is what he wrote to the investors in his annual letter

&gt;A number of smart people are involved in running hedge funds. But to a great extent their efforts are self-neutralizing, and their IQ will not overcome the costs they impose on investors. Investors, on average and over time, will do better with a low-cost index fund than with a group of funds of funds.

Performance comes, performance goes. Fees never falter

While I don’t completely agree with this view that it’s impossible for Hedge Funds to beat the market (The famous [Medallion Fund of Renaissance Technologies]( \[6\] have returned 39% annualized returns (net of fees) compared to S&amp;P 500‘s \~8% annualized returns over the last 30 years). But, it seems that on average Hedge Funds do return lesser than the stock market benchmark!

**An alternative view**

It would be now easy to conclude now that Hedge funds are pointless and the people who invest them in at not savvy investors. But,

[ ](

Given that the investors who invest in Hedge Funds usually are high net worth individuals having their own Financial Advisors or Pension Funds having teams of analysts evaluating their investments, why would they still invest in Hedge Funds that have considerably lesser returns than SPY?

The answer lies in [diversification and risk mitigation](

[  ](

The above chart showcases the performance comparison between S&amp;P 500 and Hedge Fund over the last two decades. We know that SPY had outperformed the hedge funds. But what is interesting is what happens during market crashes.

In the 2000-2002 period where the market consistently had negative returns (Dotcom bubble) in the range of -10 to -22%, hedge funds were still net positive. Even in the 2008 Financial crisis, the difference in losses between SPY and hedge funds was a staggering 15%.

This chart also showcases the important fact that most hedge funds are actually hedged pretty well in reality \[7\]. We only usually hear about outliers such as Michael Burry’s insane bet or how Bill Hwang of Archegos Capital lost $20B in two days which biases our entire outlook about hedge funds. To put this in perspective, over the period from January 1994 to March 2021, volatility (annualized standard deviation) of the S&amp;P 500 was about 14.9% while the volatility of the aggregated hedge funds was only about 6.79% \[8\].

While you and I might care about the extra returns of SPY, I guess when you have 100’s of Millions of dollars, it becomes more important to conserve your funds rather than to chase a few extra percentage points of returns in SPY.

**Conclusion**

I started off the analysis with the expectation that Hedge Funds would easily be beating the market so as to justify their exorbitant fee structure. As we can see from the analysis, on average they don’t beat the market but provide sophisticated methods of diversification for big funds and HNI’s.

Even if you want some effective diversification, it would be much better to invest directly with established hedge funds rather than going for Fund of Funds as with the latter, most of your returns would be taken by the two-tiered fee structure.

What this means for the average investor is that in almost all cases, you would get a better return on your investment over the long run by just investing in a low-cost index fund. Replicating what pension funds and HNI’s do might not be the best strategy for your portfolio.

**Footnotes**

\[1\] To signify the impact of this fee, let’s take the following e.g. if you invest $100K into a hedge fund and at the end of the year, your fund grows to $120K, they would charge you $2K (2%) + $4K (20% of the profit) for a total of $6K. Even if they lose money, they will still charge you $2K for managing your money. Vanguard SP500 ETF would charge you $30 for the same!

\[2\] Minimum initial investments for hedge funds usually range from $100,000 to $2 million and you can only withdraw funds when you’ve invested a certain amount of money during specified times of the year. You also need to have a minimum net worth of $1 million and your annual income should amount to more than $200,000.

\[3\] Barclayhedge provides data for the performance of individual hedge funds but it costs somewhere between $10-30K. I like you guys, but not that much :P!

\[4\] The returns are average not weighted average based on the asset under management so it’s representative of the individual returns of the Hedge funds and does not bias the analysis due to the size of the Hedge Fund.

\[5\] Please note that the SPY returns are not net of fees. But this would be inconsequential as a low-cost Vanguard index fund has fees as low as 0.03%. The returns shown for hedge funds are net of fees.

\[6\] To put the performance of Medallion Fund in perspective (its considered as the greatest money-making machine of all time), $1 invested in the Medallion Fund from 1988-2018 would have grown to over $20,000 (net of fees) while $1 invested in the S&amp;P 500 would have only grown to $20 over the same time period. Even a $1 investment in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway would have *only* grown to $100 during this time.

\[7\] For e.g., some hedge funds by inexpensive long-dated put options that hedges against a sudden market downturn. While this would ultimately make their net return lower in a bull market, in case of a huge crash, they would still be positive.

Cleveland Cliffs (CLF) is the largest flat-rolled steel producer in the United States. Their recent acquisitions of assets from ArcelorMittal and AK Steel have allowed them to vertically integrate each step of the process in steel production. From mining raw materials (pellets, metallics, coal/coke) to the steel-making process (stamping, tooling, and tubing) everything is now done in-house.

CLF’s product mix encompasses all things steel, mainly: hot-rolled, stainless &amp; electrical, cold-rolled, coated, plate, and others. They have an industry-leading market share with automotive vehicles, which consist of predominantly trucks/suvs (82% versus 18% sedans). Their total end-market mix consists of:

&amp;#x200B;

* 33% is allocated to auto
* 32% is used in distributors &amp; converters
* 24% is with infrastructure &amp; manufacturing
* 11% in the “other” category.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Market Opportunity**

I’ve read quite a few articles comparing CLF and the steel industry to the average cyclical commodity market, but is that really the case? It’s a fools game to think that steel will have a similar correction as to what lumber prices and many other commodities have recently gone through. I will be the first to admit that the current prices of steel may not be sustainable, but the “steelmageddon” many analysts are expecting may never come. One year ago (August 2020) U.S HRC (Hot-Rolled Coil steel) pricing was at nearly $400. CLF CEO Lourenco Goncalves acknowledged the steel industry may never see those prices again.

The smaller steel-mills that have traditionally undercut prices in an attempt to gain market share have all been buried during covid or bought up by larger companies. Steel is no longer looked at as being a true commodity and demand is very robust. The auto-industry that has recently showed a slow in demand due to microchip shortages will have nowhere to go when demand picks up again, thus steel-suppliers have the upper hand.

The U.S market for steel is roughly $103 billion, but with the upcoming infrastructure bill Cleveland Cliffs is about to reap the benefits of continued tailwinds that by the looks of it will continue until at least the end of 2022. How is this cycle different than the others over the last 20-30 years? A lot has changed for CLF as a company in the last year alone, time will tell what they can do in the next 3-4.

Let’s break-down the market opportunity for the company’s top 3 segments of customers.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Auto (33%): Revenues from the auto-industry are down because car manufacturers have not been producing the same output in 2020 and 2021. Chip shortages have hurt the business, however, pent up demand for new vehicles should be a big driver of revenues as we go into 2022. Keep in mind CLF actually went from over 70% exposure to the car industry to now only 33% with these acquisitions making them less dependent on auto-sales.
2. Distributors &amp; Converters (32%): This market usually represents other steel service centers that purchase steel and fabricate/distribute to their customers’ needs.
3. Infrastructure &amp; Manufacturing (24%): The Biden infrastructure plan should increase steel demand within the United States and the broader initiatives will bolster steel prices.

&amp;#x200B;

**Steel Futures, Contracts, and SPOT Prices**

Steel prices have rocketed in the last 12 months. Here’s a chart of the HRC (hot-rolled coil) steel futures pricing. Note it was $400 last summer in July 2020.



&amp;#x200B;

There are a few things to keep in mind when analyzing a steel company’s contracts to the price of raw materials.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Contracts range from 1-year, quarterly, and spot prices (on demand).
2. The auto-industry usually locks in 1-year contracts for price of steel.

I can’t remember precisely, but Lourenco Goncalves, CLF CEO, noted in the most recent earnings call that the average price they’ve locked in for their contracts is around $1,000, which is lower when comparing to the current spot price of $1,900. However, a lot of the on-demand supply being used for infrastructure contracts is being sold at higher spot prices.

Another thing to look at is demand for the auto-industry in 2021, which was very soft. If they locked companies into contracts at a much lower value in 2021, these contracts will be up for renegotiation soon and they will be able to get a much better price. Bottom line, if steel prices maintain at current levels, which is a possibility as demand has been very robust, CLF will be printing cash on SPOT (on-demand) revenue and lock-in further gains on long-term contract renegotiation.

&amp;#x200B;

**Steel Demand - Catalysts**

Here’s a quick breakdown of what is causing surge in steel prices.

&amp;#x200B;

1. China, who previously exported **15% of the world’s steel supply** has **taken an initiative**, by increasing export taxes, to curb pollution, cap production, and keep more supply within China.
2. The Trump administration created policies that increased taxes on exported steel. Now, the Biden administration will likely keep these policies in place as the “hot” steel industry is primed for creating domestic jobs.
3. Throughout covid steel-production was shrinking alongside demand. With everything re-opening and infrastructure projects in place demand is soaring. There is not enough supply to meet demand and steel futures prices are demonstrating this.
4. Auto-industry rebound. Car-makers have taken a hit with chip shortages and have not been able to produce as many cars as they normally would. We’ve all heard about the boom in the user-car markets due to this shortage. The demand is there and production will rebound in the coming years which should maintain strong production from steel-producers.
5. Steel-mills require large amounts of CapEx which is a huge barrier to entry. It would take years for new competitors to begin producing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Risks**

The biggest risk for steel-producers like CLF is a reversal in steel prices that have more than 300x in 12 months. CLF CEO Lourenco Goncalves was asked on their last earnings call about the cyclical-ness of the industry, and his response was:

&gt;“The other thing is that you need to understand that a lot of what's called commodity in our market is actually highly specified material that cannot be interchangeable. It cannot be just replaced at will, even though that's the perception that is sold to the market… Our timing could not be better. Prime scrap is scarce. And every day the price of scrap goes up, our cost savings from HBI becomes more significant.”

I think this gives a lot of insight into how he views the future pricing of steel as a commodity.

&amp;#x200B;

**CLF - Massive EBITDA Growth**

I want to add a separate section for EBITDA growth the company has undergone, because it is outstanding. Here’s a visual from the CLF investor presentation.



&amp;#x200B;

From doing $253 million in 2020 to their recently adjusted guidance of $5.5 billion for 2021 the growth is nearly 2,000%.

I think most analysts are expecting a reversion to the mean for steal prices, but every month steel stays at these elevated prices CLF makes an absolute killing in cash flow. If demand stays as robust as it’s been it looks like CLF might be able to rake in $6 billion EBITDA in 2022, in addition to their 5.5 billion guidance in 2021. Keep in mind these expectations are even surprising management. The company raised guidance in Q1 2021 and again recently on the Q2 2021 earnings report.

After a record quarter, the CEO also commented about how the next quarter will again break records.

&gt;“This being said, our Q2 record numbers: revenue of 5 billion; net income of 795 million; and adjusted EBITDA of 1.4 billion, should not be our all-time records for long… With the lagged and fixed pricing mechanisms we have in place with our customers, we have enough visibility to be confident that these records should be broken again here in the third quarter.”

LG was asked why he thinks CLF’s stock price is still under-valued. As with most companies that deal with commodities (due to how cyclical they are) analysts are short-sighted and can only see what the company is bringing in this quarter… The quote “A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush” comes to mind. However, based on what LG is saying, it sounds like the company will have cash flow like they’ve never seen coming in. He says: 

&gt;“But when I realized that the market is skeptical about a lot of things, that I know that the market is wrong, and I know about the cash flow that's coming, the $1.4 billion in cash coming in Q3 is real, the way our pricing structure is construed as well as the Q4 another, 1.8 billion.”

Lourenco’s main objective is to completely clear the balance sheet of all long-term debt. He’s stated multiple times that by 2022 they can expect to be debt-free. Every dollar they pay down on debt goes to equity and expands CLF’s enterprise value. By this time next year it is quite possible CLF is completely debt-free and printing cash. Excess cash can be used for strategic investments and potentially a share-buyback or dividend, which LG has hinted at before. I see two outcomes, the first is if CLF’s share price is so cheap they may authorize a buy-back of a good chunk FCF.

Let’s say the share price is at $25 this time next year and they authorize $2 billion (two quarters of FCF) in a share re-purchase program. 2 billion dollars equates to roughly 80 million shares. With a float of 450 million shares that’s nearly 18% of the float (!).

On the other hand if the shares appreciate by a large amount the dividend will be quite nice. Lourenco has said many times he thinks the current share price is extremely under-valued. My opinion is that he will do what he can to pump the stock.

&amp;#x200B;

**Valuation &amp; Fundamentals**

I’m going to compare CLF to 3 of it’s competitors. X, Nucor (NUE), and Steel Dynamics (STLD).



&amp;#x200B;

At first glance their financials look very similar and you might even say that currently they are all somewhat fairly valued. However, this is based off CLF’s trailing twelve month (TTM) revenues of $12.9 billion while we are expecting that to more than double in 2022. In Q2 2021, CLF management made a clear point in emphasizing that their top-line revenue grew by over a billion that quarter, while their cost of goods sold grew by only $100 million. A huge increase in gross margin which was made capable by their strategic acquisitions and vertical integrations. Don't forget their goal by this time next year is to have zero debt.

&amp;#x200B;

**Final Thoughts**

In my opinion, the extreme growth CLF has seen in revenues and EBITDA and the transformation of the company as whole justifies the stock price at current date. However, when I look into the future and 1-2 years down the road, I very much agree with the CEO in the fact that there is much upside to be seen, with little downside.

I like the fact that the CEO is eager to get the stock price up. I like that the company is looking to completely rid debt from the balance sheet. I like that in 2022 they will have excess cash for more acquisitions or potentially a dividend/buyback. All good signs of a healthy company that has benefited from somewhat of an unexpected boom in steel prices.

Coinbase and Robinhood have been two popular stonks on here and in the media recently. Putting all the politics aside how do they compare?

**COIN VS HOOD The Facts**

Coinbase and Robinhood have both IPO’d within the last twelve months, both operate in a similar space and compete against each other in some segments.

**Market Cap**

COIN: $52B HOOD: $45B

**Active Customers**

COIN: 56M HOOD:18M

**Revenues**

COIN: $2.885B HOOD: $1.353B

**Net Income**

COIN: $1.061B HOOD: -$1.384B

**Coinbase Overview**

Coinbase is one of the go-to platforms for people wanting to invest in \*Bullcrap coins\* the easy way. Coinbaes was one of the first platforms to make \*Shitty Coins\*\* easy for people to buy and sell. The previous method prior to Coinbase involved terminal commands and remembering lengthy codes. A slide from one of the companies pitch decks illustrates this perfectly.

The company generates revenue via fees it charges on trades, maker and taker fees, interchange fees, interest on cash, sales of software tools, interest from personal loans, and more. This is thought to expand over time to include new services such as the Coinbase card, Coinbase Pro, etc.

**Robinhood Overview**

Robinhood is an online discount brokerage that offers a commission-free investing and trading platform. Robinhood went public at $38 a share, giving it a valuation of $32 billion. The shares are listed under the ticker “HOOD” on the Nasdaq.

Before Robinhood, anyone who wanted to invest in stocks would be charged between $5 to $10 a trade. They also needed to invest a minimum of $500 to open an account.

The company gets the vast majority of revenue from payment for order flow. The company similar to Coinbase also offer a Pro tier, cash management accounts. Buying and selling of fractional shares, options and \*Coins. In theory, Robinhood competes in the same space as Coinbase however, their offering is centred around share buying and selling.

It is also interesting to note in the company IPO filing to the SEC mentions in the future it hopes to become the most trusted, lowest cost, and culturally relevant **money app**. The term money app is interesting as it indicates that potentially Robinhood sees itself as more than an online broking business. However, it’s hard to pinpoint exactly what is meant by this.

The SEC in June said that it was conducting a broad examination of market structure, including payment for order flow. Robinhood said in its S-1 that an SEC ban of this practice would pose a “risk” to its business model.

**COIN VS HOOD Revenues**

Coinbase makes over 2.2x the amount of revenue that Robinhood makes. Coinbase also appears to be growing revenues faster than Robinhood, hood delivered a 55% increase between 31/12/20 to LTM whilst in comparison, COIN has delivered an outstanding 133% increase in revenues in the same comparable period.

**COIN VS HOOD Profits**

Whilst the two companies are growing revenues at significant rates, the Net Income tells a very different story. Coinbase stock seems to have been able to grow Net Income in line with their revenue, whilst HOOD seems to have cost’s ballooning out of control. [Graph](

In regards to the additional costs, Robinhood offered the below explanation in their prospectus documents

* Our total revenue grew 309% to $522 million, up from $128 million;
* We recorded net loss of $1.4 billion, which included a $1.5 billion fair value adjustment to our convertible notes and warrant liability, compared to a net loss of $53 million;
* Our Adjusted EBITDA was $115 million, compared to negative $47 million

**Google Search Traffic Overtime**

In comparison with the amount of Google Search traffic, the two companies seem to have had similar baseline search traffic worldwide for the previous 12 months. There are a few comparable spikes for each of the companies. The Traffic in the US slightly favours Robinhood. It’s important to note that Robinhood is a US-only platform at the present time. This may give additional growth in the future.

**Robinhood Vs Coinbase: Prophets Take**

It’s important to note that Robinhood is a US-only platform at the present time. This may give additional growth in the future. This is compared to Coinbase who offers its product to 100+ countries at the moment including other large markets such as Asian and European countries. There is also at the present in our opinion a heightened regulatory risk with Coinbase shares due to the perceived nature of \*Coins\* by governments. However, hopefully, this perception shifts over time.

Robinhood has also mentioned already that it plans to expand internationally, focusing on Europe and Asia.

We believe the competition between online discount brokers makes it hard for Robinhood Stock to generate excessive gross profits. However, over time we believe a similar circumstance will occur with Coinbase as discount \*Coin\* brokers are introduced to the market.


TLDR:
HOOD is valued similar to COIN. Yet as we know It’s pure dog crap. This breaks down the numbers between the two and shows why. If you care",Coinbase Vs Robinhood Stonks,46,5

&amp;#x200B;

Here it is in 2020 



&amp;#x200B;

This does not happen in every crash, but if you look at every crash (In all different types of assets) and analyse the percentage of times this happens it comes out to be ""More than you'd fucking expect%"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Right back to the Depression. 



Yeah! I'm that fucking guy.  But that shit is true. In market tops over 100 years of charting history when prices have gotten to 161 levels of previous large pullbacks this has become a critical inflection point for the direction of the future trend. If the market is unable to hold above these levels the next bearish breakouts turn into much stronger drops. 

The 161 level is an inflection point, not a certain death zone.  So if the SPX can hold above here I do think it then will probably continue to have nice upward trending properties. And I suppose that could happen. But it's not like they're leaving the fucking planet for nothing. They know something we don't. 

When a market makes a big break of these 161 levels it is usually with news.  Big news. Unexpected news. Maybe the aliens shutting off the internet or something. IDK. But watch out for news and a sharp break of the 161 (4,140 price level). I'm not saying it would definitely be the start of the crash, just saying a lot of crashes started like that.",Why I think a SPX high soon is possible.,55,2

US futures normally have a positive correlation until recently where there are significant divergence from one another. The SPY recent price action also shows that its daily range are narrowing, a sign of market trading sideways, awaiting the next catalysts or bad news. 

Moreover, recently digested market data also indicates that analysts have overestimated the economic recovery from COVID with notables examples like Amazon and US NFP (Non-Farm Payroll) considerable negative variance. Central banks around the world are winding back their quantitative easing program and hinted at hiking up the interest rates. Current market headwinds are the lockdown (huge contributor to global demand), Delta COVID strain, central banks policy, trade war rhetoric and etc. 

Furthermore, bond yields (i.e. 5 and 10 years US treasury bonds) are decreasing which indicates that investors are moving their money in ‘risk-free’ government bonds because rising bond prices will reduce its yield (fixed coupon bond). US Dollar Index (DXY) has also risen tremendously recently and this signal a shift to lower risks assets such as bonds (USD priced government bonds) and away from share. Historically speaking, falling bond yields and a strengthening DXY normally indicates a correction might be incoming. SP500 has slowed recently and this trend could be attributed towards investors downgrading their valuation based on the recently announced earnings.

In relation to SPY, the price has been trading on the upper end of the Bollinger Bands but didn’t show any signs of breaking out. The linear regression shows that the price is moving around its historical average (red line) and didn’t show any signs of breaking out too. Those indicators supports the hypothesis that the market is unsure and waiting for a catalysts.
US is currently in earnings seasons and multiple companies earnings has been published and some of them are a disappointment (lower than estimates). US mining stocks underperform Global Sector Basic Material (MXI) average while its other sector like utilities and healthcare outperformed the Global sector after digesting the overall poor earnings results. Looking at the monthly growth of those ETF above, investors are currently taking a defensive and low risk approach by investing in utilities, healthcare and real estate. In an aggressive bull markets, technology and financial sector will do very well which is on the contrary to the above data.

In conclusion, the market is very likely to correct/downgrade in the coming weeks, once their earnings play are over as I can’t see any positive catalysts coming up.

I am here representing the high-functioning half of RetardedHedgeFund LLC. I founded RetardedHedgeFund with my brother way back in 2021, when, one day, my brother came to me asking for help laundering $17 that he stole from some teenage boys. As has unfortunately happened many times before, my brother took the money after beating a group of boys senseless because they had made fun of his doll collection. Now, despite what some people around here seem to think about hedge fund managers, I am not one to typically take part in financial crimes such as money laundering, but the last time my brother had stolen money in this way, the State Police came to our door and demanded he return the cash. For whatever reason, the fact that the police asked for the money to be returned, ticked my brother off. He started kicking and screaming and punching police officers, until he wound up in the psychward and I was left with a rather large hospital bill. So there I was, stuck between my brother's insurmountable anger management issues, the State Police,  and the fact that teenage boys will never stop making fun of a grown man who sits on a public street in his underpants playing with dolls, especially when that man is well known for being a violent adversary to teenage boys. I digress.

In that moment, I thought the best way to avoid a similar confrontation with the police, would be to “launder” my brother’s $17 using a broker app and one of the fine stocks found in the Wallstreetbets portfolio. After helping my brother scour the first class market data available on WSB, we decided to go all in on AMC. As one might expect, in nearly an instant our $17 grew to over $1000. I told my brother we were selling, to which he started yelling “buy and hold” while punching me in protest, and then snatched the phone from my hand. For better or worse, during the scuffle, my brother fat-fingered Robin Hood and sold our call option right when AMC hit $69 and we were left with $1123 USD in our broker account. My brother wanted to put the money immediately back in AMC, but I slyly convinced him it would be better to reinvest after it was confirmed that resistance at $420.69 had been broken. That’s when we decided to take our $1123 and found our family-owned hedge fund, RetardedHedgeFund LLC.

With our freshly minted LLC, my brother wanted our first buy to be the cheapest GME calls available, and as many as we could get. However, I managed to convince him that since we were now officially big time Wallstreetbets players with our own hedge fund, we should take a look at the more mature memestocks of mememania round two. Eventually, we wound up 40% down on CLNE, which is why we are here on a Saturday morning reading a yet-to-be passed 2700 page US Senate [Infrastructure Bill]( praying we find someway out of this god forsaken play.

In all sincerity, from what I’ve read thus far, I’ve found the bill quite compelling, especially in terms placing bets this autumn. I haven’t read a federal bill since I briefly taught Social Studies in what the US President had recently deemed an “urban disaster,” and a “complete shithole.” Luckily, none of my students could read, so they never found out that I can’t read either. My brother on the other hand, with his severe cognitive disability and far-below average IQ, is actually well-suited for the craft of US Law, and he has helped me sift through the gargantuan pdf to pull out a section that gave us enough hope to keep holding CLNE.

I know that a lot of you reading this will have an adverse reaction to the mentioning of CLNE, and probably think I should cut my loses and load up on 0dte spy options or juicy AMC calls at the 140 strike, but that’s not what this is about. This post, which will be getting progressively less shitpost-y (unless you think the Infrastructure Bill is a shitpost), is about the $1T Infrastructure Bill presently being amended in the Senate and likely to, in some form, become law by September. There is a seemingly endless amount of provisions within this bill that could lend themselves to both bull and bear theses for the coming months. For instance, I considered posting about another play I am researching, Lithium Americas Corp (LAC). Everyone knows there’s some stuff in this bill about lithium mining, but it also has a surprising amount of legislating about Native Americans and “Indian Land” management. It so happens that a section of North America’s largest lithium deposit is also the site of an exceptionally haunting Native American massacre and Indian burial ground known as *Dead Moon,* which has presently entangled LAC in a lawsuit with local tribes and stopped them from breaking ground at Thacker Pass. I will probably dig through the bill for LAC related content after my brother goes to adult summer camp, but for now, much like teenage boys and the State Police, my brother has a seemingly irrational hatred for indigenous peoples, and so he insisted we research CLNE and not LAC.

I’m not trying to convince anyone here to invest in CLNE—in fact the last thing I want is Wallstreetbets gangingbanging CLNE again. You (we) people brought the worst kind of attention to this stock, and instead of gliding gently up to $20 all summer like I originally imagined, the CEO Andrew Littlefair has been issuing shares and shaking us all down, and, even worse, after he hyped up the meme rally on CNBC last June. This sub got the PnD vibes all up on this pile of manure.

**Infrastructure Bill** **&amp; CLNE DD**

For those of you who know nothing other about CLNE other than cow fart emojis, *“Clean Energy Fuels provides natural gas as an alternative fuel for vehicle fleets and related fueling solutions, primarily in the United States and Canada. It supplies RNG, compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) for light, medium, and heavy-duty vehicles. Additionally, the company offers operation and maintenance services for public and private vehicle fleet customer stations.*” They take methane from a biomass (cow farts) and turn into a gas that powers engines comparable to diesel, and they also are getting into hydrogen for fuel cells for private vehicles, buses, trucks, airplanes, spaceships, submarines, carbon neutral dollhouse electric generators, etc. A big part of it is a carbon emissions play, and since CLNE is expanding their infrastructure as fast as anyone in the field, the Infrastructure Bill has everything to do with them.

I don’t know what other retard’s High School environmental science class experience was like, but I had this hippie, kind-of dyke-y but in way that was subtly hot, teacher tell me that California would be on fire by 2025 and Florida would be sinking if we didn’t do things like turn cow farts into fuel for Amazon trucks. That teacher was eventually fired after she was found in a locked room with my brother while he was wearing only his underpants, but the cow farts thing stuck with me.  This 10th grade level understanding of environmental science was the reason I originally bought into CLNE – that coupled with the fact that a lot of federal politicians today look and sound like my high school science teacher did back then, and more and more politicians of all stripes are coming around to the idea of at least cashing in on greenwashing. Greenwashing trending upwards with potential federal financial support is good for CLNE.

Overall the bill looks incredibly bullish for CLNE. It appears bi-partisan support has grown for RNG, carbon emissions reduction, methane capture, fuel production from feedstock and biomass, and hydrogen fuel cells. There is massive amounts of money being boasted in this bill going to things like grants, loans, tax incentives, support for labor. It’s unclear at this point how much this is progressive pandering and an unattainable pipe dream, and it seems unlikely it will be nowhere near as far-reaching as the New Deal era infrastructure funding, but it might be coming at just the right time for many.

Here are some highlights from the [earnings call]( which we can compare to elements of the Infrastructure Bill.

* Increasing supply while in talks with “dozens of dairies” sign on as partners. (Infrastructure will be needed to capture cow farts.) 
* The largest vehicle fueling infrastructure in the country, which provides the mechanism to generate the valuable environmental fuel credits.
* Signing RNG supply contracts with third-parties to meet today’s growing demand.
* Increasing customers in New York, Arkansas, Nebraska, California, and whatever state Amazon is.
* Facilitating training classes with the Natural Gas Vehicle Institute for dozens of maintenance technicians who will be keeping the Amazon trucks on the road.
* Electric 	and hydrogen-fuel cell trucks, albeit great, are perhaps limited by 	infrastructure and mineral resources. Using the ""California Air Resources Board carbon intensity scoring, \[an 	example\] company would have to purchase over 6,400 electric heavy duty trucks, or 13,000 fuel cell trucks to achieve the same carbon reduction as only 1,200 trucks running a negative carbon RNG.""
* Recently submitted bids to build hydrogen stations for transit agencies that will be testing a handful of hydrogen buses.

Content pulled from the bill to get an idea on language and numbers of provisions that might help CLNE:

&amp;#x200B;

* $20,000,00 wastewater grant for each of fiscal years 2022 through 2026, which includes funds for sludge (cow shit) collection, installation of anaerobic digester, methane capture, 	methane transfer, facility upgrades and retrofits, and other new and emerging, but proven, technologies that transform waste to energy.
* Some related grants have requirements such as must be “regionally dispersed across the United States and can leverage natural gas to the maximum extent practicable” which fits CLNE current business perfectly.
* “Appalachian regional energy hub initiative”  The Appalachian Regional Commission may provide technical assistance to, make grants to, enter into contracts with, or otherwise provide amounts to individuals or entities in the Appalachian region for projects and activities, that will help establish a regional energy hub in the Appalachian region for natural gas and  natural gas liquids, including hydrogen produced from the steam methane reforming of natural gas feedstocks. (Grants to develop methane capture infrastructure, bullish sign for potential third-party contractors in new localities.)
* $52,488,065,375 	through 2026 per each to build infrastructure to reduce highway emissions.
* Massive 	amounts of funding going to hydrogen found in Tittle III FUELS AND TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. The entire Title III may be worth a look through if you want a bullish feeling for CLNE, but especially “Subtittle 3--Hydrogen Research and Development,” as 	RNG can be used to produce zero emissions hydrogen, and it 	specifically mentions getting hydrogen from biomass and bio fuels, so it’s easy to see CLNE taking advantage.

Whether it’s intentional or not, a lot of Littlefair’s language on the call seems to come from having spent some time reading the bill. Big investors interested in CLNE are also likely watching the bill to estimate where state money is going.  Perhaps Littlefair is aping the bill's language in order to appeal to big investors, and if this is true, it would seem Littlefair was successful because there was a plethora of institutional buys on the day after the call.

**The Present State of CLNE Stock and Retail Perception**

I bought into CLNE in June when it was under $10. I had spent weeks staring nervously at exceptionally retarded calls on another stock and wanted to just park some money somewhere and let it drift upwards while I dozed through the summer, and CLNE seemed like a good buy at $10. Analysts had (have) it anywhere from $10-27, and it seemed like the recent changes in DC would lend to even more upside. Then Wallstreetbets started shouting about CLINE SI% (which barely made any fucking sense, by the way) the stock shot up to $15 on retail power and perhaps the relatively few shorts there exiting, all the retards, including my brother,  lost money on calls, and the mood about CLINE around here got very negative.

Instead of drifting up to twenty, CLNE spent the summer drifting down to $6. I did not enjoy it, but I held the bag, believing it would have to go up eventually. When the earnings report came-out last Thursday night, and at the same time the stock slumped to its 2021 low, I was in despair. Where were the greenwashing greenbacks? What we’re the politicians in DC doing besides trying to figure out if their pants are on or not, shouting about a vaccine that half of the population refuses to take, and looking for their son’s laptop?

As culturally enriching as the president’s son’s DIY tweaker porn is, I thought perhaps there might be even more going on behind the scenes in DC when I decided to peak into the Infrastructure Bill. In all earnestness, I was very doom n gloom at 5AM the morning after CLNE earnings. I was smacked from sleep at 3:30AM with anxiety about a sell-off, and lying in a semi-hypnagogic state, I shit you not, I see floating above my bed, a funny looking man with big ears in a cow field, smile and say, You should just sell, son. The earnings report stated a decrease of 99.2% (yes, 99.2% decrease, just like your memestock calls). Supposedly this decrease was due to a tricky deal with Amazon, but I didn’t want to think about Rocketman blasting off with hydrogen, any more than I did Littlefair issuing shares. I wanted money. Furthermore, the news is blaring about Delta variant, people invested in 3rd world vaccines are shouting about the ineffectiveness of mRNA in the rage filled chatrooms of my broker app, and I start thinking I should cut my losses with CLNE and invest in a Playstation so I can try to teach my brother how to play *Last of Us* in order to prepare him for inevitable modern tribal warfare coupled with a zombie apocalypse.

The earnings were, in actuality, not nearly as bad this Amazon deal made them look. Although revenue decreased because of the deal, CLNE increased RNG sales by 13%. As Litlefair said in the call, “excluding the effects of the Amazon warrant charges and the commodity swap and customer fueling contracts unrealized losses, revenue for the second quarter of 2021 increased by 28.9% to compared to  for the second quarter of 2020.”

This is going to sound cheesy, but the Infrastructure Bill was a little ray of sunshine during what, in my more narcotic induced brain damaged moments, seems clearly to be the end of the world. My hedge fund does not participate in electoral politics publicly or privately; my brother is not allowed to vote (not because he’s retarded, but because he’s a convicted felon), and I find elections to have an adverse reaction with my relatively fragile mental health. I don’t think a political party is going to save Earth from the human race. I think it is just as likely California will cease to be a state the moment Andrew Littlefair’s cow fart machines explode and fire consumes the entire West Coast. But there is actually something in the bill that I have not felt from the federal govt probably ever in my life, but especially since the pandemic started, and that was some sort of expectation that there will be a future. Despite my better judgment, this sensation felt good to me. Furthermore, this sensation, to me, seems to be an excellent marketing tool for this particular moment and it will make the bill and it’s consequences at least temporally popular. People have indulged in their unchecked desires for societal collapse and death for the last 18 months, and I think perhaps we are sick of it. What people want to know now is that they can work (and yes, actually have jobs) to improve the world for a future with or without COVID.  The Infrastructure Bill is going to create jobs that some people (at least momentarily) will feel good about doing, it’s going to increase revenue in multiple sectors (and decrease it in some), it’s bi-partisan, 70% popular with voters, and in the end, it could probably pay for itself by not making the money printer go brrrr so much once everyone has a decent job again. To me, of course, all this gooey-oooey goody two shoes democracy hoopla is a load of BS, because ultimately what the bill will do is at last make CLNE drift gently up to $20. I believe it already may have begun to do that before the bill is even passed, in fact.

At 7.48 CLNE is a good to buy if you don't mind holding for months, possibly year for big gains. After skimming through the bill the last couple days, I don’t really see a limit to the upside. The Federal Govt. is going all in on financially supporting a phase-out of fossil fuels. Oil is likely to get tanked by another winter of COVID, while the govt is going to be offering grants, subsidies, loans, to companies like CLNE. With vaccines and better knowledge of the virus, CLNE is likely to able to continue increasing productivity. Retail isn’t really buying these days, but institutions greatly increased their holdings this past week, with the majority of big buys coming in the day after earnings were released.

I’m now taking all of our incoming funds and investing them into CLNE shares, every time my brother beats someone up and steals their money. Risky options don't seem worth it here right now, because the stock price seems relatively in the control of big money, and big money will be the one selling you the options. The stock is largely owned by institutions, likely because it’s easy to imagine how revenues will be on a steady uptrend for many years to come, especially with this Infrastructure Bill presently making it's way through congress. That said I could see $8 by Aug 20, if I were to place a relatively placid bet.

TL;DR: you all are retarded but maybe not as retarded as me bc I’m bagholding CLNE. I combed through the infrastructure bill, looking for bullish indicators. I found a lot of implications for CLNE but lots of provisions that could affect many stocks in very specific ways.

The Infrastructure Bill is worth paying attention for gambling purposes.

A lot of us were shocked about the 19 million Fails-to-Deliver that were exposed on our last bi-weekly report, but not the GHOST! I have recognized patterns, since late May and have felt compelled to show my findings in the past. I know the overall feeling within this sub went from ""when lambo"", to ""is a squeeze still in play???"" Well I'm here to tell you, squeeze or not, CLOV is a fucking winner in the long haul, but also yes a SQUEEZE is most certainly still in play!

* First things first, yes dark pools are real.
* Yes HF'S buy on dark pools, and yes they sell on the LIT markets.
* Yes this absolutely has an negative overall affect when it comes to CLOV's current price per share!
* Yes eventually, this will cause a SQUEEZE. How much of a SQUEEZE, is anyone's guess!

**My Rinse and Repeat theory has been discussed in the past, but lets recap.**

*Every other week*, prior to the reports being made public, we have seen a trend. CLOV turns green, before eventually losing its steam mid week. Then Fridays close happens to fall short of MAX PAIN (Where the highest amount of *IN THE MONEY CALLS* lie).

The report from fintel referenced in the above link is released on or around the 2nd and the 17th of every month. The data provided from fintel I will focus on is Fails-to-Deliver (FTD). This data is extremely delayed for us as is. Therefore it's impossible to figure out exactly where we are today! IMO, this is not by accident. FTD has a major role when it comes to short squeezes!

&amp;#x200B;

[ ](

* The most recent report came out on 8/2, and covers FTD up to 7/14. Now I asked the question in my last post, *""Are FAILS-TO-DELIVER why we saw a jump on 7/12th?""* Now based on our most current report, released on 8/2, the answer is as simple as YES! But I'll break it down on how we come to this conclusion.
* The Fails to deliver reported on **fintel** for Friday, **July 9th** totalled **12,701,181**. The price per share they have listed is **9.36**.
* **9.36** is what Thursday, **July 8th's** price was at close. This means we can assume the **12.7+** million shares reported on July 9th, is in fact, how many shares were considered Fails-to-Deliver at the July 9th's OPEN.
* Come monday, the **12th of JULY**, the **FTD** were reduced to **11,461,074**. The price per share they have listed is **9.27**.
* Again, we can assume 11.4 million shares were considered FTD at the **OPEN** of Monday, **July 12th**. Friday, the **9th** of **JULY,** had a closing price of **9.27**.
* This brings me to the conclusion of my question above! Are fails to deliver why we saw a jump on the **12th of July**!? YOU GOT DAM RIGHT!!!
* CLOV closed **July** **12th** with a price per share of **9.68**. The reports issued by fintel for whatever reason skip the **13th of JULY**!?!?!?!?!?!?! See for yourself below!
* The price showing for **7/14 is 8.91**. Which is the price at close on 7/13! The FTD reported is 141,301??? They covered over **11,319,773** shares between Monday the **12th** and Tuesday the **13th**, which just so happens to be missing from fintel???

[ ](

&amp;#x200B;

 

WHY IS 7/13 MISSING???

LETS DISREGARD THE MISSING DAY FOR A MOMENT!!! (I know this will be hard to move past, but please carry on).

Here's the deal. If you look above at this image you will see yet another trend when it comes to the timing they reduce their shares shorted!!! Its clear!!!

1. HF's used to be able to reduce the Fails-to-Deliver in a day or two!
2. As HF's continue to rinse and repeat when it comes to FTD, they are in need of two things to occur.
3. First HF's need to purchase shares, in order to return shares to MM'S, so they can reduce the number of FTD. If they don't purchase shares over time, they risk momentum taking over!
4. Next they have to follow up with shorting the stock all over again in order to suppress the stock price, which in turn ends up adding back to the total FTD!
5. Remember T-3. (HF's have 3 days to return these naked shorts to avoid a penalty, and they must also keep calls *OUT OF THE MONEY* in order to refrain a gamma squeeze!
6. It isn't working. The FTD are reaching highs every other week before they reduce them prior to reporting. (19 million last report, and 5 million the report prior)
7. Hf's used to reduce them on a Monday. Then they had to reduce the FTD on a Monday and Tuesday, or momentum was getting out of hand. Which makes it harder for them to suppress the stock price by the upcoming FRIDAY.
8. The report before last showed HF's were purchasing shares in order to reduce FTD over the course of 3. (Listed Below). Followed by four days in mid JULY!!! (which is also listed below).
9. WHY is this!?!?!? Because CLOVigilantes are not letting up! We keep BUYING to Down Cost Average (DCA), and HODLING for the SQUEEZE...

Here's the TREND:

[ ](

* 6/28 over 5.6 million shares reported as FTD.
* 6/29 over 2.2 million shares reported as FTD.
* 6/30 over 1.78 million shares reported as FTD. (Last day reported prior to the most current report made public on 8/2). Remember they want to make it look like the SQUEEZE is a dying trend!

The most current report issued, shows the same trend! but instead of 3 days in a row, they were forced to lower the FTD 5 days in a row prior to the bi-weekly cycle! THIS IS PROOF they are in some serious shit!

* 7/08 over 19 million shares reported as FTD.
* 7/09 over 12.7 million shares reported as FTD.
* 7/12 over 11.7 million shares reported as FTD.
* 7/13 (missing) for whatever reason?!?!?
* 7/14 (Last day the bi-weekly report ends) ONLY 141,301 shares that qualify as FTD???

Lets break this down for a moment! The reports come out bi-weekly! They continue to reduce the FTD on the last week prior to the report being made public. My last DD shows this pattern has occurred not Just in July, but also late May, as well as all of June! Thats 4 reports consecutively! Is your jaw dropping yet!?

What can we assume will happen in MID-August!?

* The report made public will happen around the 17th of August.
* It will give us an update on what took place when it comes to FTD to close out July!

What can we assume will happen in early September?

* The reports made public that will show us the first half of August, will come out on the 2nd.
* This will give us data to analyze the FTD that is occuring as of the beginning of this current month all the way until Aug 14th.

Based upon the discussed theory discovered by THE GHOST in regards to the cycle of Rinse and Repeat, HF's are strategically reducing FTD to make it appear that our SQUEEZE is a dying trend as reports are made public. But as we have seen in the past, every report shows what?!?!?! MORE FTD at one point during the most current 2 week cycle, than what was reported in the previous two week cycle!

I'LL REPEAT IT ONCE MORE!

* Current report (released 8/2) shows a high of over 19 million FTD!
* Report prior (released 7/17) showed us a high of over 5 million FTD! (THIS IS ALMOST QUADRUPLE)!

If HF's were actually covering their short positions, we would see the following!

* HF's wouldn't continue to ladder attack us Thursday and Friday, in turn having a ton of calls expiring worthless! (Remember they make money when RETARDED APES YOLO CALLS that expire worthless. No GAMMA SQUEEZE will occur without *in the money* calls on FRIDAYS!
* We would not see reports with the number of FAILS-TO-DELIVER higher and higher throughout the 2 week cycles!

The pattern shows that come next monday 8/9 through 8/11 they will do the same! HF's will simply purchase shares, in order to return the shares to MM'S, in order to reduce the Fails-To-Deliver, in order to make it appear they are backing off yet again! How many fucking times will we see this happen, before we all understand, this is a tactic HF's are using!?!?!

Well guess what!!! This time it's a bit different isn't it!?!?!? One word!!! **EARNINGS**!!!

Now try to keep up right here.

Instead of CLOV releasing earnings in the beginning of a 2 week cycle, 8/16th, which happens to be on a MONDAY at that. This EPIC management team has decided to have their earnings call on a wednesday, prior to the end of a 2 week cycle!

I completely understand CLOV didn't ""technically"" move up their earnings call!!! The first time they made an official release was on July 15th. But the reason why 8/16 was the projected earnings date, was based upon the timing! Companies usually give earnings calls exactly 3 months apart! The fact that their last earnings call was on a monday the 17th of May, this made sense that the closest Monday 3 months later would be on 8/16! This is why the estimated earnings call was dated on 8/16 according to yahoo finance, nasdaq, etc...

You think members on CLOV's team don't remember what happen last earnings call!? You think they don't see the same trend we see every thursday and friday!?!?!? Of course they do! Everything you do, when you have a publicly traded company, is calculated by all means! They have something up their sleeve this earnings call, and they are daring HF's to try and ladder attack this shit Thursday, the day after earnings and Friday to end the week!

So many people want more from management when it comes to CLOV!

* First we got a detailed line by line explanation from **CLOV** in response to Hindenburg!
* Next we got news about expanding to over 101 counties!
* They brought on new members to their team from UBER, UNH, and GOOGLE!
* Then we got news about the warrants!
* They followed up with the FL expansion regarding primary care physicians and their partnership with **VALUEH.**
* They are purposely releasing news aka catalysts to make it increasingly hard for HF's to continue their malicious attacks!
* The only things that have changed since their first squeeze to 28, is positive changes when it comes to their team, their expansions, and when it comes to dilution of their shares, they did the exact opposite!

Now we should get our normal push on Monday and Tuesday the 9th and 10th of August. This could even run to Wednesday to be honest. This will become an even bigger problem for HF'S! During the earnings call CLOV may drop the name of their NEW CFO. Or maybe they touch up on their vision of at home care. Or maybe they have news to report about their DCE, I mean it does say COMING SOON on their website! I mean maybe CLOV improved their margins per client due to the slow down of COVID during the second quarter. All I know is one thing! If I was a HF, I cant ""plan"" to short attack on thursday and friday after earnings! It might work out that HF's can, but you cant ""plan"" on doing so!

Therefore it might be time for HF's to reverse course and start going LONG!

REGARDLESS OF EVERYTHING ABOVE!

PLEASE DO ME A FAVOR, AND SHUT THE FUCK UP WITH ""WHY DON'T THEY DO SOMETHING, COME ON CHAMATH SEND A TWEET OR SOMETHING, OUR MANAGEMENT HAS DONE NOTHING!!!""

To insinuate that CLOV has done nothing to combat what is taking place right in front of us, is the epitome of FUD, and shear ignorance.

Most of us in CLOV have legit been invested since MAY or JUNE when the price was over 20! Since when do you purchase shares at an all time high, and expect to see an increase in unrealized gain within 3 months!?!?!?

If you can't sit back and enjoy the ride, I got news for you. Stocks are impossible to time, let alone LIFE! So BUCK the FUCK up and know what you hold! Do some DD and find your conviction!

I'M JUST SAYING! This sub needs to stay positive, and if you find it hard to stay positive during the shit show thats infront of us, then don't post or comment, and take a day off from the SUB! What we need is positive energy! And although I expressed some energy above that can and will be considered negative, please don't misconstrue my PASSION as negativity! I am extremely PASSIONATE when it comes to CLOV! You should be too!!!

The way I see it is simple. Come MARCH of 2022, they will release their 4th quarter earnings of this year! This is after open enrollment occurs, where we will see an increase in patients. Then we have our expansion with physicians in FL with VALUE H! Not to mention, the amount of counties CLOV's services will be offered in, will be double the amount it was this year. By March of 2022, the 4th quarter results in itself should give you the comfort knowing you invested in a growth company, that is doing just that! GROWING!!!! Remember, maybe the squeeze got you here, and although it hasn't happened *yet*, CLOV is in a phenomenal spot!

As always, do your own DD and remember everything written above was based upon theories! This post is not to be taken as FINANCIAL ADVICE. I have no financial background, Nothing I said was to instruct nor convince you to purchase, hold, or sell anything related to stocks or calls when it comes to CLOV!

Typically I put 20% of my account on a spy call after a big red day. Then average down if the following day is also red day. Then average down again if needed. September seems like it was just one red day after another w not much in terms of recovers at all during the entire month. I would have wiped out my account 100%

When theaters go back to exclusive box office release instead of day and date streaming, movie theaters will skyrocket. On Sept 3rd, Shang Chi will be released exclusively to theaters and NOT Disney plus. Disney is losing significant amount of movie going direct to streaming and they know it. WB is going back to direct theater release at the end of 2021/early 2022. 

2.) Studios are creating movies with 200M+ budgets. Black Widow-200M, S. Squad-175M. The numbers don't make sense if they're NOT able to draw customers to the theaters due to PIRACY/Streaming. Scarlett Johansson/Paramount/Disney/WB know this is not sustainable. The exclusive theatrical window has been negotiated by WB to shrink from 90 to 45 days in Jan 2022.

3.) The ""variant"" and reopening sentiment derailed theater stocks like CINEMARK, IMAX, Marcus the last few months. Expect a mean reversion play once cases start to decline. (This is the time to buy not in a few months).

4.) CNK 1.8B market cap vs AMC 17B market cap. CNK can easily double.
 
Gross BOX OFFICE Revenues-
Jul21- 583M
Jul20- 8M
Jul19- 1.2B

Revenues are still down big from 2019 but nature is starting to heal giving you an opportunity to buy low before the crowd figures it out.

5.) You're buying for next year, not for TODAY'S numbers. 2021 is a transition year with the industry recovery kicking into gear in the second half of the year, which is loaded with blockbusters. 2022 will be close to back to normal with mega movies and giant franchisees fresh remakes and spin-offs that will have massive consumer appeal.

Expected Revenues for CNK. 

2019-3.2B, 2020-0.7B, 2021E-1.5B, 2022E-3B

6.) MANY movies were made for the big screen. It destroys the EXPERIENCE sitting on your couch constantly distracted by your phone. Drink at home or go out to a lounge/bar? It's the EXPERIENCE and that will never change.

7.) Liquidity- limited cash burn and secured a runway into 2022 if the current operating environment continues. Negotiated payment deferrals and modifications and across a wide range of lease related auto contractual obligations. $124 million CARES ACT received during 2020 and April 2021 with an incremental 30 million expected by your end. 

8.) Because of FUD and media hysteria over the variant, there is a significant discount to fair value from June. Patience required. Downside maybe to 14. Upside to 20-30+

**Edit 8/9 huge news**- 9.) AMC Entertainment has reached an agreement with Warner Bros. to showcase all of the studio’s 2022 slate in theaters for 45 days.

The world’s largest theater chain had balked at Warner Bros.′ decision to release this year’s films in cinemas and through its HBO Max streaming service on the same day.

AMC struck a similar contract with Comcast-owned Universal last year, which guaranteed theatrical exclusivity for at least 17 days before films could go to streaming or on-demand.

Warner Bros. had already announced that it would be returning to cinema-only releases in 2022 during its parent company AT&amp;T’s earnings call last month. At that time it was unclear if the studio had signed deals with any theater chains.",CNK- Huge opportunity in Cinemark,12,7

1. Revenue 
-They will give a new higher guidance or will say they expect to deliver on the top end of the current guidance.
- Their 2021 guidance is $440-480M and in Q1 they already made $112M.
- Based on public data they already did in Q2 about $115-125M only from igaming.
- When you add sports betting, mainly from PA and IL (the rest is to small) you get another $18-25M.
- this takes them to $123M to $150M for q2. This his half of what DKNG did this Q.
- with NFL coming, new state launches, organic growth and with IL keeping in person sign-up (will protect their IL market share), they will easily do another $270-300M in h2.

This is just the US but they also have other international revenues.

This will take them to $500M-550M for the year, big increase from their initial guidance.

2. Partnership
- There are some rumours they will get a new state with a lottery and that will drive their growth further 

3. Product
- they had a big upgrade on their Sportsbook apps

4. Risks
- they are very likely to lose the market access to NY, they will say they are taking part in the RFA but I think they will not be able to compete with the big guys.

5. Other opportunities 
- There is a high likelyhood that someone will make a bid for them as they have market access across the US, good product (some of it in house) and healthy revenue.
- I have a buyer in mind but I can’t share the info.

What is my play?
Even if the stock had a 10% rally in the last week or so, it’s still very cheap. Revenue wise they are about 45% of $DKNG and cap wise they are 10% or less.

I will buy LEAPS and sell calls on top.

I am new to investing, so I am still learning about everything. I would love to hear y’all’s feedback!

1) AirBnb, I am really liking this stock and I own some shares. I plan on increasing my position. I was wondering what you guys thought about the current price. I know there are going to be a lot more restrictions coming up when it comes to travel, but I highly doubt there will be a shutdown. This will still affect this business and I wondering if it’s worth waiting a couple more months after we deal with the Delta Variant to increase my position. Regardless of what happens, I plan on holding for long term. I know that it will take a few years to get back to normal, and I think that’s when Airbnb will start to take off.

2) DraftKings, I am excited about this stock because of the untapped market. I was also curious about what you guys think about this. There’s only 11 states where it is legal (if i am not mistaken). I think once other states start to allow online sports betting, it will take off. That’s obviously going to take some time, so this is also a long term hold. Another thing I like, is their revenue. They have been killing it. I think this is impressive just because sports just recently came back. 

3) Magic Software Enterprises, this is one that I just recently found and have been watching. I think getting into the software/cyber security sector is a really good idea. This company has been doing really good over the past 5 years. They just got rated 96 for their Smart select composite rating. On top of that, their revenue growth has been pretty substantial.

I very rarely see them mentioned at all, but this is great stable stock for long-term holding

WHO is Skywest?:

St. George, Utah-based Skywest Airlines (or as we in the airline business call them ""The Mormon Air Force"") stock has taken a beating in the last few weeks, along with the rest of the sector,  going down almost 40% at one point. And yet, this likely the best managed, most profitable, best cash liquidity  and debt position airline out there today.

For those that don't know, Skywest is the biggest Airline you have never heard of, the largest Regional Airline in the world, and provides flight services (Aircraft, crew, and maintenance) to United, Delta, American, and Alaska Airlines. Skywest either owns, leases, or flies aircraft owned by the majors and assigned to them.

The vast majority of Skywest Revenue comes from ""Fee-per-Departure"", meaning the Mother Carrier assigned them a time and a route to fly. If they are ready to go at flight time, they get paid. There are bonuses for on-time performance, customer satisfaction surveys, etc. The Mother carrier pays for fuel, as well. Regardless of how many people are on the plane, Skywest gets paid a set amount to operate the flight, with minimum revenue assurances for the duration of a contract.

Skywest does fly a small number of flights ""at-Risk"", meaning at their own cost, under United, Delta,  and American Airlines. With only a couple of exceptions, these are subsidized, either through the Fed's Essential Air Service Programs to small towns across America, or grants paid by localities to Skywest for Service.

They moved a few years to deal with the coming pilot shortage problem, starting Pilot Cadet Programs with several major universities as a path to Skywest Employment, and investing into their own initial flight training program in Salt Lake.

&amp;#x200B;

Financials:

Skywest Q2 2021 earnings completely blew out the analysts estimates of making $0.28 per share by almost a Dollar per, reporting EPS of $1.22.

SkyWest received a total of $250 million from the U.S. Treasury under the payroll support program extension agreement (PSP3). In the same period, the carrier repaid a $60-million secured loan under the CARES Act. 

Zack's list SKYW as a Strong Buy to $65-$70

Raymond James ha its price objective from $66.00 to $67.00.

Do what you will, but I have made a few Calls that I think are going to pay off handsomely. I really do like this stock, even more as a long-term hold. Even if things shut down again, Skywest is in a great position to weather it, because of it's cash and assets positions.

Introduction

The BLS provides an employment picture of the US on the first Friday of every month. It estimates how many jobs were added or subtracted by sector. While some of the assumptions may be controversial (e.g. [the birth death model]( and job numbers are prone to revisions, it remains the most widely anticipated statistic each month by the financial markets. Inflation is now coming in at a close second.

Considering its popularity, the job numbers are heavily analyzed by many sources. This article tries to use visuals and historical data to provide greater insight and perspective.

Recent Trends

The latest jobs number showed an increase of 943k jobs, above expectations by 100k. Unfortunately, 240k gains came from government employment which are non-productive jobs and weigh on the economy. As shown below, 943k is above the recent trend, and the largest monthly gain since August 2020. Leisure and Hospitality continue to show the biggest gains, which is not surprising considering the massive layoffs they saw early in the pandemic and that unemployment benefits have recently been removed in some states. The unemployment rate ticked down from 5.9% to 5.4%.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 1: Change by sector](

 

This next chart compares the current month with the trailing 12 month average. A few key takeaways:

* Government was well above average. 240k added vs -2k avg
* Leisure/Hospitality and Education/Health nearly doubled the TTM average
* Construction, Professional Business, and Trade/Transport/Utilities were all below TTM average

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 2: Current vs TTM](

 

The table below gives a much more detailed breakdown of the numbers and the entire labor force. Some key takeaways:

* Government job increases were dominated by local governments (+230k) vs 18k in Federal and -8k at the State level
* Leisure and Hospitality have seen the biggest 12 month rebound, averaging 196k a month. This has accelerated in recent months to 364k likely a result of expiring unemployment benefits as stated above.  

   * Even with these gains, it is still down 7.7% from where it was 3 years ago
* Mining and Logging is still down 14.6% but the recent recovery has doubled from 3.7k TTM vs 6k in the current period.
* Trade, Transportation, and Utilities is the largest sector (27k) but growth in jobs slowed in the recent period to 47k down from a TTM avg of 97k
* In aggregate the job market is still 1.5% smaller than it was 3 years ago

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 3: Labor Market Detail](

 REVISIONS

As mentioned, this data is subject to revisions as new data becomes available. While the headline release gets a ton of market attention, the revisions get far less. The table below shows the impact of the revisions over different time periods. Please note this is as of the prior month since the most recent month has not seen any revisions. Important items to note:

* The recent three month period has been revised up by 48.7k a month
* The biggest upward revisions were seen in Leisure/Hospitality and Trade/Transportation
* Over the last year, revisions have been positive of nearly 40k a month or about 500k in aggregate

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure: 4 Revisions ](

**Historical Perspective**

The chart below shows data going back to 1955. As the labor force has grown in total aggregate numbers, the recessions along the way have caused dips in the general trend. The Covid recession can be seen as the greatest job market loss since 1955. The chart also shows how much work the labor market still requires to regain the employment level seen prior to Covid.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 5: Historical Labor Market](

 The distribution of the workforce has changes significantly over the last 65+ years. Although the unemployment rate has been sharply falling over the last year (chart above), the labor force participation (61.7%) is still well below 18 months ago (63.2%) and much lower than the 66% pre financial crisis. 

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 6: Labor Market Distribution](

 

The stock market is hyper focused on the labor market because the Fed uses the data as one of its primary drivers for monetary policy. Although jobs data is seen as a lagging indicator, a strong labor market would more likely result in a tighter Fed. Weak job numbers allow the Fed to be more accommodating in monetary policy. This will result in more quantitative easing, growing [the fed balance sheet]( Additionally, fiscal support may be stronger in a weak labor market coupled with falling tax revenues. This could put more strain on [the federal budget]( which will only increases the [total debt outstanding](

While the market may anticipate tighter monetary policy and less fiscal support in a strong labor market, [the Fed is painted into a corner]( and cannot scale back the monetary stimulus without devastating the economy.",Charting the Jobs number: Almost a quarter were government jobs,58,2

Link to full earnings call transcript: [

# TLDR

**Cinemark Q2 earnings provided a useful insight into cinema attendance/streaming trends. It's not exactly an exciting equity story at the moment, more a case of survival until film slate improves and attendance gets closer to pre-pandemic levels. Mgmt said that company can survive till 2022 based on current liquidity position and monthly cash burn ($10-15m a month).**

Disclosure: Holder of Cineworld and Cinemark shares. 



# *Cash Burn / Liquidity stats*

*""During the quarter, our cash burn reduced to approximately* ***$25 million per month*** *after normalizing for working capital timing benefits and a $137 million tax refund, we received in April, which we discussed during our previous earnings call. This reduction in cash burn represents $25 million of improvement compared to the projection we provided in May, which was based on the operating environment at that moment in time.""*

***As of today, our average monthly cash burn has reduced even further to approximately $10 million to $15 million*** *including disbursements for capex, interest payments, and deferred rent and we expect that rate will continue to improve as our industry further rebounds. We ended the second quarter with a* ***global cash balance of $596 million and as of July 31st that balance had increased to approximately $610 million****.*

*This increase was driven by working capital benefits that were largely associated with the timing of July box office receipts relative to film rental payments. Based on our overall liquidity position and current cash burn rate, our* ***cash runway now extends well beyond the end of 2022****, again that projection does not include any further improvements in operating results nor does it include any additional financing options that remain available to us, such as drawing on our $100 million revolving credit line, tapping incremental term-loan borrowing capacity within our credit facility, executing sale leaseback arrangements on unencumbered properties we own or issuing equity.*

**Key takeaways:** 

a) Current monthly cash burn of $10-15m is nearly half what they predicted in May 2021

b) Cash runway extended to end of 2022..impressive.

# *CNK raised reasonably priced debt in the quarter and extended its debt maturity (positive)*

*During the quarter, we once again took advantage of favorable market conditions and refinanced our $755 million senior notes that were coming due in 2023. In June, we issued $765 million of new senior notes due in 2028 with a* ***coupon of 5.25%, a very modest increase compared to the 4.73%*** *\[Phonetic\] of our 2023 notes. In conjunction with this deal,* ***we also added two years of maturity to our revolving credit line.*** *Following these transactions, our revolver maturity* ***now sits at November of 2024*** *and* ***all other significant maturities extend through March of 2025 and beyond****.* 

# *CNK is managing to increase ticket prices successfully*

*Admissions revenues were $140.6 million bolstered by an* ***all-time high average ticket price of $9.33.*** *Our* ***average ticket price was up 15% compared to 2Q 2019*** *primarily as a result of* ***pricing increases*** *and ticket tied mix that included a* ***higher rate of consumer upgrades to premium formats****, as well as* ***fewer matinee and weekday show times***

*We've also seen in the USA,* ***a huge uptick in our premium format consumption, which is up about 300 basis points*** *as a percent of total box office* ***even without availability of 3D content*** *compared to 2019*

# *People are spending more on Food and Beverages…*

*Domestic concession revenues were $99.4 million with another all-time high food and beverage per cap was $6.59. Our per cap grew 5% versus last quarter and 20% compared to 2Q 2019 as pent-up movie going demand continues to drive a heightened indulgence in food and beverage consumption across our core concession categories*

# *CNK generated positive EBITDA for first time since pandemic*

*…domestic operations generated positive adjusted EBITDA for the first time since the pandemic escalated last year*

# *International operation improving but not yet profitable on EBITDA basis*

*…we had reopened approximately 75% of our international theaters*

*second quarter attendance grew 60% versus 1Q 2021 to 4 million patrons, which drove $25.3 million of total international revenues.*

*Argentina, we have 100% of the theaters open with very little restrictions. Brazil, we have 95% of our theaters opened and again with only minimal restrictions*

*what the key thing here (International segment) will be, will be the continued vaccination, which we said is somewhere* ***between 30 and 90 days behind the US*** *and then continued positive cash flow along the way. The only country that's really not almost nearly opened up is Peru where we only have about 60% of that country opened up and there is still some restrictions relative to social distancing and percent of auditoriums that could be filled up.*

*International adjusted EBITDA was negative $12.3 million*

# *Hiring seems to be an issue, as it is for many US Corporations*

*We're certainly having (US Labor) pressures like I'd say the entire real estate segment is having with regard to what's going on with the workforce. Most of those pressures have been just on our recruiting effort,* ***which has become more cumbersome****, thus far we've been able to continue to get largely the workforce that we've been seeking and we* ***haven't seen a material impact on wage rates yet***

*One of the things that we're* ***fortunate about is we tend to have a younger, more seasonal workforce that hasn't been as affected by stimulus money****, these are* ***students in high school and college who are generally looking to work during the course of the summer and the holidays****, to be able to have money to take back to school, they like the flexibility of ours that we offer, and they like the perks being able to get free movies.*

# *CNK on Streaming / Disney+*

*Disney has come out as we expressed last time they had five pictures, we've released three of them those had an in-home premium access day-and-day,* ***but the next two Free Guy and Shang-Chi have 45 day exclusive windows.***

*So, Disney has been very clear that they've been testing and learning, they're trying to figure it out during this pandemic trying to offer optionality to consumers so that they can either see it in the home or in theaters particularly during this pandemic time and I think the thing that gives me solace on this is that* ***Bob Chapek, their CEO has been very direct, very clear that theatrical business was a $13 billion worldwide business for them that help set up franchise****, it helped eventisize movies and was very important in their ecosystem.*

# *CNK on Delta Variant/lockdowns*

*But here's what I think is the key thing, when the whole COVID crisis began we responded very, very quickly and I think led the industry with the Cinemark standard and we came out with a whole set of protocols based on the data that was coming out of the CDC.*

*And then, when the CDC made their adaptation and said the most important thing is air quality,* ***we pivoted literally almost immediately, we converted all of our theaters to MERV 13 air filtration****, on the HVAC system,* ***we increased the fresh air coming from the outside as much as a 100% to 300%.*** ***So we're very nimble at being able to adapt and change on this and we've been doing it now for 16-17 months, our theater teams are very adapted there****, so we're ready to go if and when we have to make further adaptations*

# *CNK - Attendance comparisons vs 2019*

***Analyst Q (Jim Goss):*** *“The run rate for the second quarter domestic admissions and concessions was roughly* ***35% of 2019 level to look at it that way****, if that's sort of a normalized year. I'm wondering even with the film slate you have for the third and fourth quarter,* ***what you think might be acceptable minimum targets for Q3 and Q4 in that regard****, do you think there is a chance to get back to 100% or would it be more like an 80% or 85% by the fourth quarter and how would it flow into it, because it seems like there has been a little bit more of a lag getting into the bigger numbers even though obviously did very well in the second quarter…”*

**CNK CEO:** *“…Look, we think that the box office is going to recover beginning. It's actually obviously began in the second quarter, it's going to further in the third quarter, the fourth quarter as I indicated the line of films is outstanding and I didn't even go into the lineup for 2022. We've done that before, but I mean it is really outstanding. Now the question is, is the box office is going to recover 100% or 90% or 85%, I think that very hard to predict and guess against. But I would put it this way, we are very, very well positioned to be able to adapt to that to make sure that our profitability returns to a level that is acceptable to us and to our investors and we're just going to have to see, I mean, we don't know is the box office going to return to a 90% level or an 85% level.*

# *On Piracy threat for Streamers…*

*And so, the issue now is as if a movie has a potential to be in the home day and date, then* ***a digital copy is going into that home and potentially increase in the level of piracy, because now you're introducing a new place to be able to pirated from and I think all of the studios are obviously very concerned about this*** *and doing everything they possibly can to reduce that and then also running their own numbers in considering what the negative impact is not only on their business of the studios business, but it also clearly affects the partnership with us because we're doing everything I can, do everything we can to reduce piracy and if its introduced in the home, then that's starting to affect our business as well. We haven't been able to come up with a hard and fast number to put against that, it's clearly important and something that is industrywide issue for not only exhibition, but also the content providers.*

Jim Goss -- Barrington Research -- Analyst

*Okay.* ***Yes, because it's a perfect copy basically available easily they don't even need to sneak in to do anything like that****. And it does come out of your aftermarket, your first run market as well.*

**\*CNK on the film slate this year and upcoming film slate\***

*Well, first of all, I think given the circumstances of the industry and the COVID variant and all the publicity associated with that, I think that* ***opening up a movies like Black Widow to $80 million is a very, very successful, the run for Fast and Furious and again extremely successful, A Quiet Place Part II, I think that movie opened strong and continued to play and play and play****. So we've got to take it in the context of the environment in which we're acting in and look there is no secret that Cinemark feels very strongly that we would like an exclusive window and we're willing to adjust what had been the traditional exclusive window, because we think it's good for our business and truly we think it's good for the entire business because we think it allows studios to then window their revenue and allows consumers to actually purchase the same exact content in multiple formats, which benefits the content owners. So look, we're in a very fluid environment it's hard to say this movie was successful and that one wasn't.*

*But when you look at these past films that we've had, I'm pretty darn encouraged on what's going to happen.* ***I'm also excited to see the third and especially the fourth quarter because the fourth quarter with movies like Bond coming and Dune coming and of course Top Gun coming and many of the others I mentioned, I think that we're in for a very significant recovery from the fourth quarter, which is going to lead in to that 2022****. So, I can't be put in a position of nor can Sean of trying to predict, but I would say relative to the movies that I indicated we're satisfied, we think that we can actually continue to do better as the COVID threat becomes less and less and we think we can do better with an exclusive window, then we're going to have a day and date arrangement.*

# *CNK on Movie-club goers*

*Nearly 20% of our business during the second quarter was coming from Movie-Club members. So that's obviously one of the reasons we want to do it. It just further communication with them, they tend to be the* ***most frequent goers and they also tend to be very high food and beverage purchasers.***",Cinemark earnings call analysis ($CNK),23,11

* Institutions need to report their holdings by August 16th EOD (45 days after quarter end + weekend). Most institutions report on the very last day but many start reporting leading up to it.
* Most of the reported holdings reflect institutional ownership as of **June 30th** (end of Q2) market close. Making institutional ownership a very lagging metric (at least 45 days and at most over 130 days). 

Institutional Reporting season has started. Over the next few weeks, more and more institutions will report their holdings. Every quarter people inevitably make false claims regarding Institutional Ownership, in most cases just to fuel their confirmation bias. Heres how to not fall for those misleading claims.

# What exactly is a 13-f filing?

A 13-f filing is a SEC filing that institutional investors (who have at least $100M assets under management) are required to file. In this filing the institution reports various assets, the most relevant being Stocks and Options. Short positions are not reported in a 13-f. These filings have to be filed within **45 days** after a quarter's end reflecting their positions at the end of that quarter.

# Options:

Institutions have to report option contracts they owned on the 13f, they **do not** have to report short option contracts so it is impossible to know a funds true position. 

The options are reported by their notional shares- If an institution, lets say Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management, [reports having]( 800,100 Puts on Tesla valued at $534,411,000, it doesn't mean Dr. Burry YOLO'd half his firms capital into Tesla Put options. The 800,100 puts reported are notional shares, meaning he actually has 800,100/(100 shares per contract) = 8001 Put option contracts and the ""value"" of those put options is simply the notional shares multiplied by the closing price of the stock last quarter. The strike price or expiry of these options isn't specified anywhere either. For all we know, he could have bought $1 weekly put options for 1 cent each for a total of $8001 dollars just to screw with people- obviously this doesnt stop the media from going [crazy](

Options reported on 13fs are extremely useless.

# ""Look, almost 20 institutions bought shares just YESTERDAY!"":

No they didn't. They bought sometime between March 31st and June 30th and **reported** that they owned the shares yesterday. Their holdings are reflective of June 30th. 

# ""OMG look Blackrock and Vanguard are both invested in this stock!"":

Great.... but Vanguard and Blackrock have 8 and 9 Trillion dollars in AUM respectively, them being invested in your company with 2\*10^(-4)% of their assets doesn't really mean much. They also have 13,756 and 14,996 reportable holdings respectively, your one stock really isn't that special when it comes to these two (and other massive institutions). And in most cases most of the stocks held by Vanguard and Blackrock are just wrapped up into a nice mutual fund or ETF and given out to investors. Frankly, Vanguard and Blackrock NOT being invested in your stock should be a sign of concern.",PSA: Institutional Ownership can be very misleading.,25,7

OPEN and ZG compete in the iBuyer space with OPEN almost exclusively focused on iBuying. They bought 7,000 homes to ZG's 4,000 this past quarter.

RDFN is down significantly today (&gt; 8%) because ZG reported great sustained growth for a well-established business. ZG's stable horse is growing at an incredible rate, and their dominance in this space is becoming even more prominent.

OPEN is flat because ZG's best growth this quarter was in their iBuyer segment. As a result, people are wondering what kind of a growth a smaller company, OPEN, who bought ~2x as many homes as ZG could post for earnings next week.

They're all slightly fucked today because investors are too short-sighted in looking at Zillow's decreasing revenues, which is in reality due to ZG entering a massive growth cycle and expanding their business.

Now to my unironic apprehension, upon research into $CI earnings, $CLOV looks fantastic in r/R ratio here so here's a little pie for you donkeys.

[50+day trend $CLOV](

Clover Health looks well poised for another strong breakout next week with earnings as a major catalyst. Extremely strong support at \~$8. Volume has been fading hard (usually implies sellers and bagholders) - 50m 90day avg. and 15m 10day avg. Yet despite this, support has kept it even thru the red days above $8. Today, the trading volume is sitting at just under 6m with less than 2 hours left on the trading week. It's actually rising as I write this lmao.

But more than technical, my research into big dog rival in $CI - Cigna Corporation's earnings after talking to that dude in my history makes me very bullish for $CLOV next week. [They just posted earnings and beat with raised guidance, though with elevated costs.](

\- Clover is well poised for earnings. Since the beatdowns of the recent past not exclusive to - Hindenburg report, Chamath snake oil salesman, market pullbacks, delta concerns, past earnings userbase growth miss etc., markets been pricing CLOV like complete dogshit. So why am I bullish?

\- Cigna Corporation, the rival big-boy boomer health insurance company, just had a positive earnings with huge growth in revenue but projected more claims costs which hit profit margins along with a slowdown of userbase growth. Why is that, in a time where the CEO says health services / biotech are booming? It's simple, boomers be losing market share to growth. \*Bah gawd that's CLOV's MUSIC\*

\- CLOV is constantly working to automate and expand their tech. [ boomers won't be keeping up with this company aimed at growth with millions of new subscribers.

\- CLOV CEO went and explained his case to dissolve some of the claims against the business from Hindenburg report / lawsuits a few weeks ago, caused a stock spike [

\- CLOV earnings are priced in to miss again, which I am not sure if that's accurate. Over the last few months of recovery and people going out, more people are going on Medicare and/or health insurance plans, including travel and all. The number of people in need of health services certainly didn't DECREASE thru COVID. America don't give a damn about COVID anymore, that's $ for business.

\- And yet, it makes me more bullish that Cigna, the household name for such health services, blamed COVID for the potential upcoming cost deficits as well as lowering guidance of user growth. I am sure they don't want to mention losing market share to competitors, a la Clover Health among others.

\- IV for CLOV is at/below 100 for the first time in a long ass time. Options are cheap and there's a lot of room for the upside.

\-  I'm expecting CLOV to beat/meet EPS estimates, but CRUSH Revenue as they continue their M&amp;A and R&amp;D expenses. Again, CLOV is growth. But even with the last Q, it's pretty clear they are growing despite missing initial subscriber growth estimates. They won't miss new targets. They are growing.

\- Cigna dipped 10% pre-market and since has begun to rally up, sitting at 2.5% gain today after an overall [Earnings Beat and Raised Guidance]( Their guidance dropped not simply due to COVID, but competitors such as CLOV coming in to fight on the big stage, and I'm here to catch that ride.

\- I did not check short interest as I normally don't care but I assume this stock is forever shorted and with IV near all-time lows, gamma is cheap enough to pressure some degree of squeeze I imagine. Vanna is also cheap, considering IV usually rises before earnings. Likely it will all rise next week.

TL;DR - CLOV looks cheap at 8 dollars and will likely have bullish guidance and growth with its' earnings report on August 11 due to factors listed above.

Let me start by saying I possess no brain cells and even less of a clue about the financial markets. That said, I work in the tech sector. Have eyes all around the tech industry on up and coming companies like Confluent. 

Confluent is a cloud based Kafka-as-a-service company founded by the creators of the open-source Kafka software. Kafka is an event-driven data mobilizer that basically takes data sitting in databases and accelerates it into other systems that use that data for other purposes. We won’t get into the weeds here, let’s just say that companies these days are starting to implement event-driven architecture as a standard for IT. Kafka is widely becoming used, and Confluent is the easy solution for companies that want Kafka but don’t have the manpower or the know-how to manage it. 

Confluent IPO’ed last month at $44 per share. It’s currently trading around $45 per share, I bought in about a week ago at $39 per share. 

The fact of the matter is- if Confluent can secure major partnerships with companies that are moving into the cloud, they may well see their share price sky to 3 or 4x their IPO price. This would put it around $130-175 in a year or so.. making it a steal at the moment. 

The reason I think Confluent will succeed is because a lot of major companies feel the pressure to move to the cloud, and they are adopting the quickest solution which is to sign contracts with cloud vendors who manage the infrastructure for them. It’s a plug and play style of IT and I personally have eyes on a lot of companies making this move right now. ***big disclaimer here because my long term view on this strategy is bearish, I see companies adopting cloud vendors in the next 5 years and moving away from them around that time, meaning that Confluent success may ultimately be short lived.

**I. Introduction:**

Proterra designs and manufactures zero-emission electric transit vehicles and EV technology solutions for commercial applications. Founded in 2004, Proterra is a monster in electric bus manufacturing in the United States, with over 600 busses delivered, 750 million in backlog, and over 20 million miles of service[ already bagged.]( The company has a very bright future no matter what, but the Infrastructure bill makes that future a whole lot brighter.

The bipartisan Infrastructure Bill has about 1 trillion dollars for various projects and initiatives with WSJ reporting that it is expected to include “**$39 billion in new funding** to modernize public transit and[ replace thousands of buses]( with zero-emission vehicles”.

Now, the specific language of the bill has not been written yet, but even a fraction of this $39 billion would represent an **absolutely massive, and I mean truly gargantuan, increase in funding for electric busses**. Right now, the main way electric busses get funded is through the Federal Transit Administration’s Low or No Emission Vehicle Program (“Low-No”) [which has only given about $600m over the last six years]( No, that's not $600m per year, t**hat's $600m overall**. That means that funding for electric transit busses is about to jump from around an average of $100m per year to having access to a potential $39 billion. Even just $1 billion of this would represent a **1000% increase in funding**. This legislation represents a seismic shift in the electric bus market that would supercharge any companies in this particular sector, with analysts predicting this new money will balloon the US ebus market[ five-fold to $2.7 Billion by 2024 alone.](

Two companies stand out in this regard: Proterra, and BYD.

BYD is a Chinese manufacturing company that, among other things, manufactures a shit ton of electric busses. In China, they fill contracts ranging in the [tens of thousands]( In the US, their subsidiary has completed some of the largest electric bus contracts in the US and is aggressively moving to expand production, technical capacity, and acquire more contracts.

They have one big problem though. Politicians in both the Republican and Democratic parties have acknowledged the rise of China linked energy companies as a threat to US national security. Nobody wants to move from having OPEC hold us by the balls by controlling oil supplies to China suddenly having an undue influence on the very means of public transportation in our streets.

Due to this, at the end of 2019[ Congress passed language]( in the National Defense Authorization Act that bars use of federal funds to purchase Chinese busses. In fact, they [explicitly called out BYD by name]( as a national security threat and prime target for blacklisting from taxpayer money.

This means that there is a relatively good chance that BYD will struggle to receive much of the proposed funding for bus electrification in the upcoming Infrastructure Bill. Even with them having a unionized, American workforce in 99% American factories, they still have not been able to convince politicians that they match the requirements for “Buy American” initiatives.

Therefore, a sizable amount of the remaining money designated for electric bus adoption will fall to the other top electric transit bus maker in the United States: Proterra.

**II. Overview:**

Based in deep blue California with a factory in red South Carolina, Proterra is the ideal vehicle to advance Democrats' vision of enacting deep climate change fighting policies as well as providing good, well paying American jobs to boost local manufacturing industries. Indeed, Proterra has already been recognized by the current administration as vital to future Democratic political ambitions, with President Joe Biden[ touring their plant virtually]( and Vice president Kamala[ touring their partner]( Thomas Built Busses in person.

Transportation in the US currently accounts for[ 29% of all US emissions]( making it the highest contributing sector to CO2 levels. A strengthening of public transit and an increase in electric bus adoption[ would make more of a difference than almost any other policy]( the White House could enact.

Despite this though, only[ 2% of US busses currently are electric]( Comparatively, China, at the end of 2017, was hitting at least[ 17% of busses being electric]( while, overall, [99% of electric busses world wide]( are being produced in and for China. This is not even mentioning huge electric bus orders in both India and throughout Europe that easily outpace America's own efforts. The United States is badly losing the Green tech race, by almost every measure.

The Infrastructure Bill, however, promises to turn that all around. And a land where no one wears shoes is a prime opportunity for a shoe manufacturer.

Due to this, there are many companies that will inevitably benefit. New Flyer, Lion Electric company, Vicinity Motors and other electric bus makers will most likely see significant upside from upcoming government subsidies and contracts. However, Proterra stands out as the number one domestic pure electric bus maker in the United States with extensive recognition by the US government.

More significant than any of this though, is that the main advantage Proterra has over other electric transit bus companies is that **PROTERRA IS NOT AN ELECTRIC BUS COMPANY**. Though most people, including the government, recognize Proterra as a leader in the US ebus market, their true potential and current market strategy is so, so much more.

Proterra has three modes of revenue: Powered, Transit, and Energy.

* **Transit:** designs and builds the busses
* **Powered:** develops and distributes electric powertrains and battery system for various commercial vehicle partners
* **Energy:** offers full scale electric support infrastructure in terms of design, build, financing, operations, maintenance and energy optimization.

This means that while building electric busses is currently their bread and butter, their business is increasingly having to do with **Proterra Powered** and being more of a pick and shovel play: providing complete battery packs, technology, and powertrains to other companies looking to go electric. To simplify this, it means that instead of trying to build a whole new electric vehicle and market it to potential customers, Proterras strategy is instead just focus on the battery and electric parts while partnering with already established big name brands to let them build the actual vehicle. This allows for them to straighten profit margins and avoid competition with older companies.

In essence, this massively expands their potential market penetration and enables them to surmount being pigeonholed into one particular sector, like how many of their competitors are in the commercial transit bus market.

**III. Partnerships:**

And before you think this is some pie in the sky vision they have, the reality is that Proterra is already the #1 leader in electric commercial vehicles with a ton of key partnerships with established blue chip companies. These partnerships are the foundation to Proterras long term strategy, allowing them to expand into new markets for vehicles to electrify. As of now, they are involved with powering.

* Thomas school busses
* Van hool coach busses
* FCCC stepvans
* Optimal shuttle busses
* Komatsu excavators
* Volta delivery trucks
* Bustech transit busses
* Lightening commercial vans
* And just recently announced partnerships with ROUSH CleanTech and Penske Truck Leasing to develop Ford Motor Co's F-650 all-electric commercial truck, as well as a new partnership with Taylor Machine Works Inc. to develop an all-electric material forklift handler.

And of course, this isn’t even getting into how Daimler Trucks, which is the **leading heavy-duty truck manufacturer** in North America, is a[ major Proterra investor]( and technology partner. This particular connection gives Proterra credibility with larger, more established corporations, giving increased opportunities for expansion such as how Proterra works through Daimler subsidiary Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation to build delivery trucks for companies such as **Fedex, UPS, and Amazon**. This massively expands their source of revenue, as yearly sales for this type of vehicle[ measure 200,000 compared to just 8,000 for transit busses]( In fact, they estimate that by 2025, the bulk of their revenue will actually come from these “secondary” sources of income as opposed to their so far main business of electric transit busses.

**IV. Sales:**

Busses are only the tip of the iceberg of what Proterra is aiming to be. Beyond just electrifying just about every other vehicle offered in the commercial market, Proterra offers something that I personally have never seen from any other bus company: end-to-end electric vehicle solutions including charging stations and Proterra developed management software.

The main appeal of Proterra is that they have developed an integrated technology ecosystem of different products that promotes sales that they describe as being “sticky”. **What this means is that once you buy one Proterra product, you're incredibly likely to buy something else as well**. Buy a bus - might as well buy their chargers - buy their charges - might as well buy their software system, and so on.

Impressed with their transit busses? Well lucky for you your yellow school bus fleet is about to expire and the company you already have good relations with and have [a positive view of also makes that product]( Repeat business is a big plank of how Proterra operates. Currently, [80%]( of Proterras Transit customers end up making an additional purchase from their Proterra Energy division. A perfect example of this is how Miami recently upped its Proterra bus fleet from 33 to a total of 75 busses, and then went ahead and[ hired Proterra to install one of the largest fleet charging systems in the U.S]( Reputation is king with emerging technologies, and Proterra has deep networks with almost every transit agency in the US.

It's also important to note, circling back to the infrastructure bill, that on top of whatever money ends up being designated for transit busses, that there is also **$7.5 Billion** **for developing charging stations** and $**2.5 billion for school busses**, both areas that Proterra can take advantage of, as they offer full scale fleet charging stations and their partnership with Thomas Built busses means they are[ actively working with the number one school bus maker in the United States](

Going even farther, Proterra is fully **vertically integrated** almost all the way down their supply chain, with battery cells as one of the only third party components that is not built in house. However, they have secured around 2 GW of cells through 2022 through LG Chem, and are **currently planning their own battery facility**. That means that not only can they tap into government money meant for EV producers, but they can also take advantage of any funds allocated towards American battery producers, [a part which most likely will make up]( a sizable portion of the 3.5 trillion dollar reconciliation bill that is currently being worked on.

**V. Advantage:**

Proterras main advantage over other competitors is their head start on research in this sector and data obtained that you can only get from over a decade of real world experience. Proterra is currently on their 5th generation battery design and their 5th generation bus, with a combined over 20 million miles driven over their various vehicles. Furthermore, the partnerships and connections they have (both business and political) already established emphasize their first mover advantage.

Proterra also holds over **81 patents** and offers unique services such as their **APEX Connected Vehicle Intelligence System**, which is a cloud based data platform that helps customers manage and monitor their fleets, allowing them to optimize ownership and operations as well as providing state of the art analytics. Working this **SaaS** approach into their overall business model is pivotal in differentiating Proterra from other companies. Additionally, there is also potential to use programs like APEX to **transform Proterra Vehicle charging stations into Utility Grid Assets** which would offer another avenue for revenue and make their systems more attractive to prospective buyers. Proterra is the leading competitor for this necessary next step for all electric vehicle makers and[ is leagues ahead of any rivals](

**VI. Connections: It’s all about who you know**

I believe Proterras connections are **unparalleled** by any company and have established them as a preeminent force in both the **business and political world** that most other companies would be hard pressed to match. I won’t go through all of them, but to highlight a few:

Jack Allen: Chief Executive Officer and Board Chairman

* Over three decades of experience in the driving core businesses at Navistar International Corporation (**one of the largest trucking companies in the world**) serving as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer President of their North America truck and parts division, President of Navistar’s engine group, and has also has served as Vice President and General Manager of the company’s parts organization.

Jennifer Granholm: Former Proterra board member (resigned to take cabinet job)

* Current **Secretary of Energy** for Biden admin (the DoE is responsible for dealing out loans, contracts, and grants relating to electric busses and other vehicles.)
* CNN political contributor (media connections)
* Former Michigan Governor (deep ties with auto industry and championed auto bailout in 2008)

Ryan Popple: Co-founder and Executive Director

* **Early employee of Tesla**, served as senior director of finance with a focus on strategic planning, technology cost reduction and corporate finance.

Dustin Grace: Chief Technology Officer

* Nine years of powertrain development expertise from **Tesla Motors**
* Worked R&amp;D at Honda for four years.

Josh Ensign: Chief Operating Officer

* Vice President of Manufacturing at **Tesla Motors**
* Led global operations in Honeywell International’s automotive and aerospace businesses

Jochen Goetz: Board member

* 30 years experience and currently serving as Head of Finance &amp; Controlling at **Daimler Trucks &amp; Buses**
* Lead positions at Mercedes-Benz Trucks, Powertrain, and Daimler Trucks North America divisions. He was the head of Planning and Reporting for **Mercedes-Benz Cars** and the Daimler Group. Since April 2016, Goetz has served on the board of directors of Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation.

Audrey Lee: Director of Arclight (entity that took Proterra public)

* Clean Energy for Biden co-founder. This council has been described as Biden's **bridge to the private green energy sector**, and has undoubtedly been the driving force behind Bides tour of Proterra and continued close cooperation between the company and government contacts.

In addition to all this, Proterra has also hired two Obama-Biden white house officials to lobby the government on Proterras behalf: Pete Gould who was associate director of government affairs for the Department of Transportation, and Christine Turner who held numerous trade-related positions throughout the administration, including on the White House National Security Council. Their lobby firm is also helmed by Brandon Hurlbut, who was chief of staff at the Department of Energy, a top energy adviser to Obama at the White House, and co-chaired Clean Energy for Biden.

And lastly, notable investors in Proterra include the Generation Investment Management, (a fund partly managed by **Al Gore**), Tao Capital Partners (run by the Democratic megadoner, including the current governor of Illinois, Pritzkers clan), and BlackRock (which **current National Economic Council Director Brian Deese** previously worked at and who also just so happened to join Biden for his Proterra factory tour.)

Safe to stay, Proterras leadership and connections are absolutely stacked with heavy hitters in the electric battery implementation sector, trucking and vehicle development industry, and in the highest echelons of our government. I have personally never seen a company so well managed with experienced professionals that is as tightly ensconced with government officials as this one. In fact, these connections make Proterra resemble Lockheed Martin or Boeing more so than just your average bus manufacturer.

And when those billions of dollars start being dispersed from the Infrastructure Bill, it will be these connections, connections none of Proterras competitors can boast of, that will make a key difference in levels of funding and access to further opportunities.

**VII. The Plunge:**

Despite all this though, Proterra stock has cratered almost 40% the last month.

Why? There are four primary reasons for this.

Pipe dumping

* Pipe stands for Private Investment in Public Equity, and essentially means that after a company files an S-1, the lockup period ends and these investors are free to sell their shares.
* Proterra filed its S-1 around July 12th and the share price quickly started sliding downward.
* While PIPE investors chose to capture a 70% profit in the sixth months, this does not reflect a wider feeling about the future prospects of the company.
* As of now the PIPE selling is over and the stock just needs something to juice it back up into a positive direction (something like, idk, billions of new funding suddenly becoming available)

Spac name being tarnished

* Proterra went public via a special purpose acquisition company this year, and thus is often associated with other companies that went public through a SPAC
* SPAC companies like Lordstown have been a fiasco, and Nikola,[ well we all know how that is turning out](
* This has really put a damper on any company even remotely associated in this space, and similar to Microvast, Proterra seems to be getting lumped in with more vaporware companies.

Too many ipos

* An incredible amount of companies are going public at the same time, and investors just can’t seem to settle on which ones to invest in. There have been[ over 400 ipos this year alone]( twice as much as last year, and there's still five more months to go before the year ends.
* “When you see a lot of companies coming public ... then that is a very bad sign for the averages because it means the stock market is getting flooded with new supply,”[ Mad Money]( host Jim Cramer explains.
* Supply exceeds demand = low prices and dispersed attention
* Big advantage of Tesla was that they were the only “shiny object” for EV on the market for a long time, which consolidated all interested in this sector into one single company. [That's no longer the case](

Bad Press

* There were a few articles either released or dug up last week that questioned the reliability of Proterras products. I won’t go too far into the specific issues though, as most if not all problems listed were with Proterras 1st generation busses. They are currently on their 5th generation of electric busses.
* There was a singular issue with the bus chassis showing cracking in Philadelphia, but these issues are superficial and specific to one custom made model on a specific route that [does not affect Proterras overall designs](
* Additionally, much of this bad press has spawned from conservative media sources, due to the fact that this is such a closely Democrat associated company.

While detrimental to the stock in the very short run, these issues are thankfully not due to any inherent weakness of Proterras product or marketing strategy and thus, do not represent an undue threat to its future potential. I fully believe Proterra will rebound soon as it gets more attention and mainstream name recognition.

As for the specific issues raised by the conservative articles, [here is Proterras response]( as they can give a better rundown on how meritless these articles are then I can.

**VIII. Financials: Significant Numbers**

Here's a link to Proterras[ full financial breakdown]( I won’t put it all here but here are some highlights.

* Current market cap: $2.22B
* Current stock price: 10.70
* 2017-2025 CAGR is 50%
* 800m cash on hand
* No debt

Projections:

* 2021E Rev: $246M
* 2022E Rev: $439M
* 2023E Rev: $838M
* 2025E Rev: $2566M

The biggest thing to note here is that these projections were done before the infrastructure was even beginning to be considered, which means **it is highly unlikely that the insane amount of funds in the current Infrastructure Bill were factored into specifically in the early year projections**. The implementation of the bill will juice these projections to a degree I don’t think anyone can really expect.

I do know for a fact that the partnerships announced in the last few months are not currently priced in, as they constitute more of the 2023-25 revenue. These moves being made recently, such as the partnership with Rouch and Taylor Machine Works  Inc. (**a partnership which by the way Proterra stole from BYD**) this early, will most likely move the projections up a bit.

Part of the reason I won’t go too far into financials is that the passage of the Infrastructure Bill in its current form will **flip Proterras potential on its head.** It's already been steaming full ahead but new funds like this will of course change things.

The Infrastructure Bill passing and their first quarterly report as a public company on **August 11** is the prime catalyst for what I see as whether the potential for this company is real or not. August 11th will really give us a good look into whether the company is holding up to its projections and how the financials are looking going forward. More news on their battery factory development and announcements on more corporate/government partnerships are all possible, with the forward guidance going to be of critical importance.

Now Citigroup does have a **PT of $16** for them, but as of yet the stock hasn’t gained much attention from Wall Street. I believe this is due to the fact hedge funds are **too busy looking at where the puck is, not where it's going to be**. Very similar to how the Morgan Stanley analyst for some idiotic reason only used Microvasts current factory output stead of including their factories under construction, most hedge funds are **too caught up in Proterras past that they are incapable of seeing where it is going.** The Infrastructure bill will supercharge Proterras bus business while Proterras Powered market strategy and big name partners have the ability to ride the infrastructure wave into unimaginable heights, a position few other companies are in a similar position to do so clearly and obviously.

**IX. Growth and Long Term Strategy**

Proterra currently has a battery and transit factory in Industry, California and another transit facility in Greenville, South Carolina. Backlog dating to their initial January 2021 presentation will keep their factories going until early 2022. This does not take into account the multiple contracts and research partnerships they have announced since.

They currently have capacity to **produce about 680 busses per year** and are aggressively working to hire more technicians and engineers to reach this potential as soon as possible. They’re[ recruiting like crazy]( with many positions being graveyard shifts, which reinforces their past statements of moving to a system where they’re pushing out busses 24/7.

This will allow Proterra to capture even more market share of emerging electric sectors while maintaining their dominance in the electric bus field, of which they already have **50% US market share.**

Speaking of their busses, **75% of total materials in the busses are sourced from the US**. This is significant as the Biden administration has[ just recently announced a proposal]( to raise the Buy American standard immediately from its current level of 55% to 60%, to 65% by 2024, and to 75% by 2029. The fact that Proterra is already operating at the 2029 level means that this will not affect their financials but will potentially cause disruption in other manufactures, forcing them to revise their financial forecasts.

**How are they trying to Grow?**

Proterra, which went public just recently like Microvast, is using their current war chest of about $800 million to grow in three ways: **Research and development, Growth Capex, and Domestic Cell Capacity and co-investment**. R&amp;D on battery tech and creating more efficient systems is easily the most important direction Proterra needs to double down on, so it's good to see them devoting significant resources (200-300m) to further developing their battery designs and energy storage devices. And as I’ve already said, developing a strong, steady, and hopefully fully in-house battery production chain will be key to bringing Proterra to the next level, an objective they seem to already acknowledge and are moving forward to.

From this, it's helpful to view Proterra as not an electric bus company that does research to further that goal, but more of a research company that happens to build very good electric busses in order to support more research. **43% of their workforce is apprised of engineers and technicians and it shows**. This research will assist in continuing to streamline their production and build on their already lowering cost, such as how the **cost of batteries has fallen 85% since 2010**. The research has also instigated other developments that make their busses world leading in terms of technology and also in consistently[ breaking records](

Proterra is very forward thinking and is consistently looking for new ways to grow and expand. The **TAM of the electric commercial vehicle market is 260 billion** and the **charging market is 37 billion**, and Proterra so far hasn’t even come close to scratching the surface of what they can do. Construction diggers, dumptrucks, airport shuttles, forklifts, flatbeds, bucket trucks, cement mixers, mining transports and so much more are all prime targets for electrification and there just straight up isn't any other companies that are moving as aggressively as Proterra to capture this market. Leveraging their connections, reputation and capital derived from their eclectic transit bus foundation, Proterra can **outmaneuver** and **outcompete** any single competitor in a particular commercial vehicle sector through their holistic end-to-end full cycle product catalogue.

And when I say Proterra is forward thinking, I mean really forward thinking. Back in 2017 (when most other bus makers were just beginning to shift to electric or hadn’t even made a prototype yet) Proterra initiated the [world's first autonomous bus program]( This tech will eventually allow them to increase safety, lower costs, and make every step of public bus transit more efficient. The fact that they are already actively working on such a revolutionary concept when most other players are still struggling to go all-electric demonstrates that Proterra not only thinks years ahead, but acts as the market leader in ebus technology

And besides AI, Proterra also has their eye on another pretty futuristic goal, going so far as to engage in talks with the Pentagon about [​​electrifying military vehicles]( Non-frontline vehicles, such as construction trucks, diggers and movers used by the Army's Corps of Engineers for domestic American infrastructure projects don’t run the risk of having to compensate for battlefield conditions and are **prime targets for electrification**. When these vehicles inevitably go electric, the fact that Proterra is already having these conversations with DoD officials puts them in a prime spot to secure future contracts. It also doesn’t hurt that Proterra has already partnered with Komatsu (who not only build construction equipment but has **years of experience building military vehicles**), its co-founder Ryan Popple is **ex-military**, AND that CEO Jack Allen formerly helmed Navistar who just so happens to **make a ton of vehicles for the military**. If any company is going to get military contracts, these guys are right up there able to compete with legacy players like Oshkosh, except Proterra actually has the required electric experience and is ready to hit the ground running.

And of course, Proterra is also looking towards the environmental sustainability of its product down the line. This past spring, Proterra partnered with Nevada based Redwood Materials, created by **Tesla co-founder JB Straudel** to recycle its used batteries, [becoming the first publicly announced partnership between Redwood and an automaker]( This not only further reinforces their Tesla connection, but also again demonstrates how Proterra is looking years down the road to ensure the wild profitability and success of their company.

**X. Conclusion:**

There is a huge gap in the EV market as well as in how we are strategizing to fight climate change, and Proterra is the only company that can meet both needs simultaneously. While most attention is being paid to the potential of the consumer electric vehicle space, few are considering just how we are going to electrify all those other vehicles that make up our society. You can’t just take a battery built for a sedan and stick it into a bus or a tractor and call it a day. The process takes time, money, failures, and, yes, even more time.

While the legacy automakers are each racing to develop their own battery tech and specific innovative technology for consumer cars, Proterra is positioning itself to leverage its almost 2 decades of battery research and powertrain experience to partner with almost every commercial vehicle sector to provide the real world tested technology they need before they even have a thought to develop it themselves. The potential of Proterra is absolutely massive and so far, few have truly realized this.

tldr: Proterra has been able to leverage their position as an early pioneer in the electric transit bus market into partnering with the leading companies in each commercial vehicle sector -Thomas built school busses, Daimler stepvans, etc- to circumvent trying to outcompete legacy players and instead combine their technical, patented breakthrough technology with well established reputations to become the #1 commercial vehicle developer over the next few years. Coinciding with the release of the Infrastructure Bill, they are set to dominate this market and become a behemoth of industry with billions of dollars in revenue in only a few short years.

The e-commerce theme has been good to us ordinary retail investors who have been all over the usual suspects. AMZN and SHOP have been spectacular. Industrial warehouse REITs like PLD have been beasts.   PYPL is killing it. Even old school retailers like WMT owe their resurgence in part to its pivot towards e-commerce. 

Shopping is moving online and that is not changing anytime soon. But the old e-commerce names have a lot of this good news baked in already. GXO is a brand new name and still seems like its flying under the radar - literally it just got spun out of XPO. 

Not sure why but the spin out has not been received as much airtime as I would have thought. Part of this is that spin-outs are not as flashy as IPOs but still. Given GXO is a unique pure play on e-commerce I would have anticipated more noise but its hardly been talked about. 

The uniqueness of the business is worth talking about because it operates in a somewhat niche area of warehouse outsourcing where its hi-tech capabilities (automation expertise) differentiate it materially from the smaller players. 

Basically big companies with growing e-commerce businesses go to GXO to outsource their logistics to them. GXO works with their clients to identify warehouses, leases those warehouses and then brings in their expertise to manage the asset for the client through the introduction of appropriate automation. GXO are experts in tech-enabled logistics. They are not an industrial real estate play like PLD. They are the experts in squeezing the most efficiency out of each square foot of warehouse space on behalf of their customers. 

TAM is massive. Right now the company only represents approx. 5% of the outsourced logistics market which the company estimates is $130bn TAM. Through M&amp;A they will grow that slice of the pie (more on that in the catalysts section). 

The bigger TAM opportunity is the $300bn of currently insourced logistics. Think big box retailers currently owning their own warehouses, managing their own shipping and returns, dealing with the associated HR burden and trying to figure out how to automate the whole thing (not their specialty). These big box retailers are realizing that in order to grow fast they can outsource all of this to experts like GXO, which frees up capital and time and effort to focus on their core businesses. 

The stock has done well post the spin off last week but here are some catalysts to look forward to:

2) M&amp;A. The company has said it needed its own balance sheet to pursue inorganic growth and now it has that. Lots of fragmentation means consolidation opportunities.

**Paramount+ added +6.5 mio new sVoD subscribers** during Q2 while Netflix reported only +1.5 mio. They are set for launch in Europe and Australia next year as part of the recently announced Sky partnership, so there's still plenty of headroom for further growth.  

I figured it might be interesting to plot subscriber count evolution for both streaming services, assuming constant growth rate (based on last Y-o-Y or Q-o-Q growth). 

Based on current YoY growth Paramount+ could surpass Netflix sVoD by Q2 2024. If last quarter growth is sustained it might even catch up before the end of 2023 with approx 224 mio subscribers.

&amp;#x200B;



&amp;#x200B;



I realize this is not a fair comparison since Paramount+ actually has accelerating growth while Netflix seems to be close to its peak now. The outlook is actually even better. Point I am trying to make is...the current PE ratio of ""value stock"" ViacomCBS (9.2) vs Netflix (54.4) makes no sense imho given it's currently outpacing Netflix in growth. 

**TL;DR:**

**ViacomCBS remains significantly undervalued**, but it seems to be finally regaining its bullish momentum (+7% yesterday after earnings). I believe the time is now or never if you want to get in cheap before it hits Pluto.

PS: there's another $VIAC DD recently posted on this sub...might want to check it out, it's a lot better than mine :)

Astra Space announced another launch window beginning August 27, 2021 for its first commercial orbital launch with the United States Space Force. Following this launch, Astra is under contract to perform a second launch later this year.

So as you can see they are improving a lot from the first attempt to the third one and i am pretty sure the next launch will succed, so finally they will have their rockets ready to work, and it means the share value price will skyrock too.

This was not meant for you apes; Seek ing alpha denied my article because they don't want recent SPACs merger on their website.

So instead of earning cash to spend it on stupid shit, I'm here wasting my time for you all because I don't want 50 hours and 4000 words of research to go to waste, let me tell you gamblers why Microvast ($MVST) is a Hidden gem.

First of all, you retards probably came for the short squeeze potential, rumor has it, there's not many shares left to short sell and Microvast is down 60% from its peak (even after yesterday's 20%+ run), but I could not care less about that, MVST will trade significantly higher once decent analysts start coverage on it and this post will tell you why. You guys are so lucky to have found this now, I've been holding since November when it was $11, so the price right now is still dirt cheap (it was $15 two weeks ago...).

Quick introduction for those of you who don’t know what Microvast is and what it does. Microvast is a technology innovator for Li-ion batteries that designs, develops and manufactures battery systems for commercial electric vehicles and energy storage that feature ultra-fast charging capabilities, long life and superior safety. Microvast believes the ultra-fast charging capabilities of its battery systems make charging electric vehicles as convenient as fueling conventional vehicles and believes the long battery life of its battery systems reduces the total cost of ownership of electric vehicles.

Microvast is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 87%, their estimates are justified by the growing desire for electrification as well as the growing demand for clean energy and the zero-carbon revolution.

The forecasted battery components revenues (see picture below) come from Microvast being vertically integrated. Their battery components are world-class, significantly differentiating and they are going to sell those parts to some key cell manufacturers in the passenger EV market (specifically their aramid separator and their gradient cathode). They currently ship to passenger vehicle applications (SAIC) but are also engaging with passenger OEMs that have made the announcement that they will manufacture their own batteries (with battery components)\[1\]. They also plan to do the same thing with consumer electronics.

&amp;#x200B;



Microvast's projected revenues

While their projections may seem optimistic, they were able to secure partnerships with industry leaders representing over $1.5 Bn in contracted revenue through 2027. $44 millions, $125 millions, $172 millions, $250 millions, and $355 millions for 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025 respectively. Those numbers were before they recently announced a partnership with eVersum, a high-tech vehicle OEM, specialized in the design, development, and build of the most purposely engineered electric commercial vehicles for passenger transport. The deal has a potential volume forecasted to be more than 100 million €.

There’s a great interview on [cheddar news]( with Shane Smith, COO of Microvast, where he talks about why Microvast went public and raised more than $800 million: “We raised capital to support orders we already had in place. We’ve won more business than we’ve had capacity for”. It seems like Microvast has a great problem; the demand is bigger than the supply at the moment, which is great news as they may not need to spend a lot on marketing if customers are coming to them directly.

\- Microvast has over a decade of expertise in designing and manufacturing battery components (Cells, electrolytes, packs, separators). That differentiates them from most of the other battery makers who source their components from the vendors. It is important to note the cell makers do not have the right to produce the material that they did not invent or have the license for. “Microvast invented and manufactures the key battery materials to ensure unique performance and by also guaranteeing the leading time because the material patents are the strongest patents, legally protected and our success is founded on our deep technology portfolio which is wholly owned and protected by over 550 patents (and patent applications)”, said Dr. Mattis, Chief Technology Officer of the company.

\- They have more than 1800 employees including more than 500 employees in the R&amp;D division.

\- They have 28000+ Battery systems in operation in 19 different countries.

\- More than 3.8Bn Miles of operational distance was covered with no major safety incidents.

\- Their Batteries can run at a high temperature for a long time and they won’t explode. They have this proprietary way for their Batteries to be 90% as efficient as brand-new ones after 10,000 charges.

\- Among all of Microvast’s products, two stands out that no one else in the world has: the 100% Aramid separator and the full concentration of the grading of the material.

o “One of the perks for the solid-state battery is on shrinking separators and with our Aramid separator, we are there”, Dr Wenjuan Mattis said in the Wedbush conference held on April 8th2021. For the fans of solid-state batteries, this could be a major catalyst incoming. Their Aramid separator has higher thermal stability than charged cathode material; 2X the temperature resistance of traditional poly-ethylene separators, enhancing safety and charging time.

o “We have almost 15 patents in solid-state batteries, it’s one of the three advanced technologies that we’re working on”, said COO Shane Smith. 15 might not look like a lot compared to QuantumScape, which holds over 200 patents and patent applications related to solid-state battery technology, but they operate in different markets, MVST in commercial vehicle batteries and QS more in the passenger EV batteries. Also, it’s important to mention that they are not really competitors at the moment, Microvast generated about $ 107 million in sales in 2020 and is expecting to generate more than $2 billion in sales in 2025 compared to QuantumScape, which will not generate meaningful revenues until 2026, according to the website “[barrons.com](

\- The other material, the full concentration grid in the cathode, is a unique material made by Microvast. With this technology, they can tune the distribution of the transition metals across the particles, which allows them to maximize the capacity and maintain safety and at the same time minimize the cost and the risk by reducing the cobalt content. The material has a capacity 20% higher than the best material in the market and is 10% lower in cost. They have a production line that has been making 600 tons per year (for the past 3 years).

**Partnership/Customers**

\- They have solid partnerships, including FPT (the global powertrain brand of CNH Industrial Group), Oshkosh (leading global innovator of mission-critical vehicles and essential equipment), Porsche, SAIC, and many more. Oshkosh also made a $25MM strategic investment in the PIPE, and signed joint development agreement highlighting future battery collaboration and integration. It is worth mentioning that Oshkosh received the USPS contract to replace its mail delivery trucks (the initial contract is. worth $482 million). Also, it is an open contract, meaning USPS will be able to order more vehicles throughout the 10-year contract ([they will order between 50,000 and 165,000 vehicles]( This is a lot of potential business for Microvast and could represent a serious catalyst in the future once more information is available. Oshkosh expects to start production in 2023, right when Microvast’s factory in Tennessee will be up and running. Remember, MVST went from $14 to $23 the day Oskosh got the USPS contract, this will definitely be a HUGE catalyst once we know more about it.

\- They can count as their customers some of the leading global bus OEMs including Yutong, Higer, Foton, King Long, VDL, and Wright Bus. Their batteries are being deployed across a broad range of commercial vehicles, including automated guided vehicles, port equipment, mining trucks, fork-lift trucks. They also have customer relationships with the likes of Kion, Kalmar, KoneCranes, Linde, PSA Singapore, and Gaussin. All of these names are recognized as leading OEMs in their particular area of focus.

**Key advantages over its competitors**

Microvast is very unique in itself and it is hard to compare them with other public companies; some are fairly young compared to them and others are well established but operate in the passenger EV battery market and it is unclear when/if they will shift towards the manufacturing of commercial EV batteries.

Their closest competitor is probably \*\*\* had to get rid of this competitor (market cap under 1bill) but the short answer is that MVST is 10 times better...

If we do a quick head-to-head comparison, we can see Microvast seems to have a clearer path to achieve its Revenue goals.

\*\*\* is headquartered in Los Angeles with a factory of 113K sq.ft compared to Microvast with its biggest factory in China (1.72MM sq.ft.), another one in Germany (170K sq.ft.), and one in the United States in 2022 (577K sq.ft.). In contrast, \*\*\* has more than 200 employees and Microvast is expected to hire around 300 employees only for their new factory in Tennessee and they also have more than 500 employees working in the R&amp;D division as mentioned before.

It looks like Microvast is better positioned to profit from global electrification with their factories established in three different parts of the world.

The picture below shows both their year-over-year revenues growth, which could be a bit misleading as they are not in the same business stage and operate in different continents for now. China and Europe lead the United States in electric commercial vehicles on the road, which could explain the difference.

&amp;#x200B;



But the point I want to make here is that they rely on different things, \*\*\* miss on revenues is due to the short-term limited number of battery cell providers, producing safe, high-performance cells suitable for the commercial electric vehicle market. “We know, we, and the whole industry, need more cells”, said the CEO of \*\*\* in their latest earnings call. Whereas Microvast produces their own cells, relying more on the primary resources. See the picture below for Microvast 2021 projected Revenues as well as \*\*\* forecasted and revised revenues.

&amp;#x200B;



On the other hand, it is true that Microvast did not have earnings call yet to discuss their 2021 outlook but I believe they are in line to achieve their projected revenues. They had \~ $107 MM in revenues in 2020 and if they keep the same YoY growth rate of 115% (Q1 2020 à Q1 2021), they will get to $230 MM by the end of the year. The key differentiator here is that Microvast manufactures their own cells, which ensures high quality, faster product development, greater customization to client needs, and tighter cost control as well as higher margins. The fact that Microvast has its own in-house manufacturing capacity is a clear competitive advantage to my eyes (see picture below, found on Microvast website).

&amp;#x200B;



Both of these companies are currently highly valued based on their potential and future expected revenues. At their current market cap, \*\*\* is selling at an estimated 2021 P/S ratio between 23 and 51 and MVST with an estimated 2021 P/S ratio of about 12. Once again, these two companies are not at the same business stage and I believe they will both succeed and grow at an impressive pace, however, MVST’s growth perspective and business model seem less risky and more predictable.

I have a conservative 2023 Price target on MVST of $25 (that was for Seeking Alpha, let's be real here $25 is legit fair value for Microvast, it should trade at a premium for all its potential not a discount), which is more than a 200% increase from its current price of about 8$ and $25 also happens to be their 52 week-high. My price target is based on discounted 2023 revenues and a P/S ratio of 12 (85% of forecasted 2023 revenues (85%\*751MM) \* 12 = \~$7,5 billion market cap). Considering their direct competitor is currently more expensive (P/S between 23-51) and other companies operating in a similar sector are trading at high valuations: Tesla (\~20 P/S), Pro terra (\~11 P/S), QuantumScape (Market cap of 9.5B without revenues yet), and Nikola (Market cap of \~4B without revenues yet), Microvast can be considered as fairly cheap and this price target of $25 as conservative. It could easily go to $40 is what I meant.

**TAM is estimated to be $30Bn + in 2025**

· Battery providers are expected to play a pivotal role in the EV value chain: \~ 30-40% of EV value resides in the battery.

· The rotation from gas-powered commercial vehicles to electric-powered commercial vehicles might happen quicker than the rotation from gas passenger cars to electric passenger cars because of government funding. Also, with the lithium shortage, the world will have to mine more lithium but it would not make sense to use powered-gas trucks to mine to then build electric batteries for a greener future, I believe the U.S government as well as the other governments, will make sure we use clean energy to mine lithium or any other natural resources, which would benefit Microvast.

· The demand is bigger than the supply at the moment with battery cell production in the U.S. just below 40 GWh in 2020, while battery demand exceeded 42 GWh. For context, achieving President Biden’s goal of a 100% electric fleet of U.S. government vehicles will require 69 GWh of battery cells. I believe Microvast is well-positioned to become a giant in the industry with their new factories; they planned ahead, which could give them a competitive advantage over their competitors.

· EV Battery market is believed to be at a key inflection point (EV is 1.5% of 2020 sales – 8.5% by. 2025), which equals to an expected CAGR of 55% (based on sales in key markets: U.S, Europe, China, Japan &amp; South Korea). Source: [Microvast investors presentation](

Ø There is a profound energy transition toward renewable energy driven by governmental policies that are synchronized for the first time, according to Frederique Carrier in the [RBC Global insight May 2021](

o The European Green Deal refocused the EU’s COVID-19 stimulus package onto renewables -charging infrastructure, power generation, and green hydrogen projects (allocating up to $600 billion to green projects).

o China’s 14th Five-Year Plan called for electric vehicles to constitute 20 percent of overall new car sales in China by 2021 from just 5% now (spending up to $1.5 trillion).

o Joe Biden won the U.S presidential election with a sweeping infrastructure program (up to $2 trillion).

o Microvast is well diversified in these three growing markets with its biggest factory in China (1.72MM sq.ft.), one in Germany (170K sq.ft.), and another one in production in the United States (577K sq.ft., expected to start production in 2022).

\- According to Shelby Tucker, RBC Capital Markets, LLC Utilities Analyst, the global market for batteries has the potential to grow 100 times by 2050.

Also, great find by [u/Little\_Objective\_683/]( : The U.S department of energy (DOE) asked Microvast in 2019 to build a Li-ion battery facility in the United States to fulfill Microvast's biggest order to date, which will make Microvast the largest American Li-ion Manufacturer.

&amp;#x200B;



**Global market presence**

After primarily being focused on the PRC and Asia-Pacific regions, they are expanding their presence and product promotion to Europe and the United States to capitalize on the rapidly growing electrification markets. In 2021, they will be launching a marketing campaign to introduce Microvast to more potential customers in regions outside the Asia Pacific region and adding more headcounts to support business development ([source: Sec.gov; DEF14 form](

The European market presents enormous growth opportunities for electric vehicles, driven by higher emission standards, reduced total cost of ownership compared to gas-based combustion engines, and growing environmental awareness. In the United States, they believe a new political administration is likely to push the electrification revolution through regulation. In pursuing contract opportunities with industry-leading companies in the United States, they have seen how their potential customers recognize the lower total cost of ownership for commercial vehicles and are seeking alternative forms of energy for energy storage applications.

As they expand their presence globally, they will continue to invest in their existing partnerships in the PRC and the Asia Pacific region and continue to grow their business there.

&amp;#x200B;



\- Revenues in Europe decreased by about 22% while Revenues in PRC increased by more than 260%

\- I believe the decrease in Europe is temporary and was caused by the pandemic, since it affected the whole industry, as Panasonic mentioned in their latest earnings report. and with the new factory in Germany, it will become more convenient for European companies to try and buy Microvast’s products. According to the website [iea.org]( new electric car registrations were about 3 million globally in 2020 and for the first time, Europe led with 1.4 million new registrations followed by China with 1.2 million and the United States with 295 000 new electric cars.

**Bear Case**

I could not find solid bear cases anywhere on Microvast other than “it’s a Chinese company, stay away” or “insiders are dumping shares on you, get out”.

Let’s talk about the latter quickly. As found on [the sec.gov DEF14 filing for THCB]( (SPAC that merged with Microvast),

“Subject to certain exceptions, the Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement further provides (1) Wu will be subject to a lock-up of one year with respect to 25% of his shares and a lock-up of two years for the remaining 75% of his shares, provided that, with respect to the 25% of his shares subject to the one-year lock-up, he can sell those shares if the shares trade at $15.00 or above for 20 days in any 30-day period and (2) the Microvast equity holders other than Wu are subject to a six-month lock-up. The Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement further provides that the shares owned by the Sponsor Group will be subject to a lock-up. Specifically, with respect to 75% of the shares owned by the Sponsor Group, (a) 2/3rds of such shares are subject to a one-year lock-up unless the shares trade at $12.50 or above for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period and (b) the remaining 1/3rd of such shares are subject to a one-year lock-up. With respect to the remaining 25% of the shares owned by the Sponsor Group, (a) 50% of such shares are locked-up until the later of the one-year anniversary of the Closing and the date on which the shares trade at $12.00 or above for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period, (b) the remaining 50% of such shares are locked-up until the later of the one-year anniversary of the Closing and the date on which the shares trade at $15.00 or above for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period and (c) all of such shares are subject to forfeiture if such trading targets are not met by the fifth anniversary of the Closing.”.

In other words, insiders are not “dumping shares on us” at a price of about $8 (now $10) because of their lock-up agreement.

Should you fear Microvast because it is a Chinese company? Perma bulls will tell you it is not a Chinese company as it is headquartered and founded in Houston, Texas. In reality, it really is a Chinese battery maker coming public through an American SPAC, [according to Dana Blankenhorn]( (let's not argue about this fellow retards, it doesn't really matter; China is years ahead of the U.S in EV). If you were on vacation the past couple of weeks, here’s what happened with the Chinese stocks:

\- A crackdown on education has spread to Chinese tech stocks and the whole Chinese market (MSCI China index delivered negative returns of -14% in July).

\- Investors fear the unpredictability of the Chinese government, which could explain the 40% drop in MVST share price in a month.

So, the question is, should you be greedy when others are fearful as Warren Buffet said? Or should you panic sell after a 40% drop in a month?

Here’s what UBS Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefel had to say on China:

“For the tech sector, Beijing remains focused on its long-term goal of technological self-sufficiency and leadership on the global stage. We believe the regulatory risk will continue in the socially sensitive sectors of property. And healthcare, we don’t expect the government will push these sectors to non-profit either”. Another important part that Mark Haefel discussed is directly related to Microvast: “Offshore equities are pricing in a higher risk premium. This is likely to linger in the near term. However, we think Future returns will be largely driven by earnings growth (mainly from cyclical and value sectors) this year. We recommend investors cherry-pick stocks across sectors that are supported by earnings growth but have limited regulatory risk exposure. Our preferred sectors include consumer durables and services, energy, and Greentech.”

In the short term, who knows where the stock price can go, however, if Microvast delivers on their promises, we will most likely see abnormal returns. I understand the risk of companies operating in China, but what I particularly like about Microvast is that they are diversifying away from China with their factory in Germany and one incoming in the United States, they will be on three different continents, which is worth something to my eyes.

Let’s summarize what has been said before with a SWOT Analysis

SWOT AnalysisStrengths:

Ø Unlike competitors who redesign existing batteries to fit them in EVs, Microvast has designed its batteries from the ground up specifically to address the problems facing EV batteries. Every step of the manufacturing process is controlled by Microvast, leading to higher quality and lower-cost products.

Ø Researchers from Microvast have developed a novel high-power battery technology that has a higher energy density, longer life, and safer operation than any other state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery on the market. The system is built from four breakthrough technologies and could potentially be used in plug-in hybrid electric vehicle and fully electric vehicle markets. Because of its many benefits, the technology has the potential to also enhance the performance of lithium-ion batteries used in cell phones and other smaller-scale applications, as well as in electric grid applications.

Ø $ 1.5B total contracted revenue in Pipeline through 2027, which will help Microvast to grow revenue at an expected CAGR of 87% from 2020-2025E

Weaknesses:

Ø Being a “Chinese company”, U.S investors might not like it as much as a U.S company.

Ø Portfolio Managers being scared of investing in SPACs or even the “deSPACs phase “after the SPACs controversy in the beginning of 2021.

Opportunities:

Ø There is three substantial untapped markets that Microvast plans on expanding their products offering to; Passenger Vehicles (PV), Energy Storage Solutions (ESS), and Battery Components (Consumer Electronics), which could expand their TAM by $45B.

Ø 2021: Begin Battery Production in the area of Berlin, Germany

Ø 2022: Begin Battery Production in Clarksville, TN

Threats:

Ø Susceptible to disruption, many companies are trying to improve EV batteries and might not need Microvast in the foreseeable future.

Ø The Prices of Lithium-ion batteries have been plummeting over the past decade, and that trend is expected to continue in the coming years, which could impact Microvast’s profit margin.

Ø Other companies are working hard on lowering EV battery costs, one or more of them could make a battery substantially cheaper than Microvast.

To conclude, I believe the growth opportunity in the commercial EV battery sector is impressive as well as somewhat predictable as it makes sense for companies to go electric economically, financially, and environmentally. Microvast is well-positioned to capture a great portion of the total addressable market of $30 Bn and has the opportunity to dramatically increase their TAM if they expand their business to consumer electronics, passenger EV batteries, and energy storage solutions market. The fact that Microvast went public through a SPAC merger less than a week ago gives retail investors an edge to generate alpha as analysts have not started to cover the company yet. Microvast also fits the criteria of sustainable investing, a trend that is not about to die anytime soon. Overall, Microvast has everything it needs to become a successful company; it now just needs to deliver on its promises.

So, the real question is: does the upside outweigh the downside?

You tell me.

Sooo did you get the $**PENN** news? You want to profit from a Casino/Gambling stock that might even be an buyout canditate? ***A stock that is about to repeat a 45% bullrun it had in may?! A Stock with multiple $32 price targets that propably get pushed up due to better financials when the stock is sub 20 right now?!***

# Let's talk about $IGT aka International Game Technology.    💸  💸 🚀

&amp;#x200B;

A company that provides **lottery**, **casino slot machines, sportbetting, ticket scratch** and a ton of others worldwide!

&amp;#x200B;



I *just* found out about the stock. They had earnings this week and I was surprised to see different EPS beats and misses and different numbers all around so I took a dive into the stock and the whole ""gaming"" market.

&amp;#x200B;

At first, lets take a look at the **chart**:

What we can see is the stock has been sidetrading and consolidating for a while in the first months of 2021. Then may happened and a nearly **45% bullrun happened. Why?**

Well their Earnings in mid may were very strong, they were finishing the sale of a part of their company that wasn't really profitable in italy. That sale finally happened in Q2 btw.

**We saw a run form $18 to $26!**  💸  💸

The stock retraced back to $19 right now, which is crazy. Most of that propably on covid fears and unrelated to the business.



Let's talk about earnings. Q2 Earnings were a bit wild, because with the sale of a part of the italy business, they created a humongous income that pushed their GAAP-EPS to **fucking $1.49**. Now obviously they won't sell off parts of their company every quarter, so that is a number that won't hold.

What is important though is the fact they paid 700mil of debt in Q2 alone!

&amp;#x200B;

[taken from their Q2 presentation](

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Their cash from operations increased by 50% YoY and they deleveraged their debt from 5,4x to 4,3 in 3 MONTHS and paid over 1.1bn in debt in the first half of 2021 alone!

&amp;#x200B;

So why should you care? Because $IGT

1. reduced **debt by a ton** and has no outstanding maturities until 2024
2. the gambling/lotto/gaming market soars back with less covid restrictions and will continue to do so, als mentioned in the earnings call. Gamblers will always gamble, **and even if they can't gamble in the casino they will gamble online!**
3. they provide a ton of gambling, sport betting, internet-lottery: Some of which are played by big twitch streamers for example

&amp;#x200B;

[24&amp;#37; increase over pre-covid levels already!](



&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Why get in NOW?

With the run of $PENN and the positive sentiment right now, $IGT is primed for a run. They surprised analysts with their huge debt reduction and are priming themselves for a very strong 2021. ILottery, online gaming, sport betting, app implementations and more betting platforms will rake in cash further.

&amp;#x200B;

# Now comes the crazy part. OWNERSHIP AND INCREDIBLY LOW FLOAT 🚀🚀🚀

&amp;#x200B;

Institutional ownership of the **205mil** shares outstanding sits at roughly **40% (!)**, while insiders (mainly B&amp;D Holding SpA, aka the owner of $IGT) hold over 51% of the shares outstanding. **90% of the shares outstanding are held by insiders or institutions!**

&amp;#x200B;

That means that the effective free float would be just about 20 million shares. That's incredibly low and makes the stock very sensitive to movement. Hence the 45% bullrun in may.

&amp;#x200B;

[ownership](

# ANALYST PRICE TARGETS

Analysts nearly all see the stock as a buy, pricetargets of $**32** are the norm. That would be **68% UPSIDE from NOW.** 🚀 highest PT is $35 right now!

&amp;#x200B;

# Let's do a TLDR:

\- $IGT reduced their debt strongly in the last quarter and analysts liked that (david katz from jeffries for example is the most recent)

\- Gamblers will always gamble, no matter if they do it online or live

\- $IGT will and did profit by the increased positive sentiment ($PENN for example)

\- they are a possible buyout target

\- their free float is extremely low with most of the stock held by insiders and institutions!

&amp;#x200B;

Positions:

a ton of 01/2022 22c

So I am sure that you like me have noticed the recent resurgence of COVID all across the world. Unfortunately, world leaders have not been able to convey the seriousness of the situation but that is neither here nor there. The important fact is that covid infections are rising this means that vaccines are becoming more valuable as an asset. This is why we are seeing moderna skyrocket. However, there is another vaccine play that hasn't really been talked about (as far as I can tell anyway) and it is Ocugen. There are two primary catalysts that I believe will push the stock today and in the coming weeks. First during the earnings call, what they say about their ability to supply the Bharat Vaccine to their customer, and how they see the progression of this third wave of covid infection. The second primary catalyst today comes from some technical analysis which will be dependent on what the earnings call will sound like, if earnings go bad then technicals won't matter.

So before we can understand where we are going I think we need to look at the past. So back in February the company spiked on news of a partnership with an Indian biotech firm to distribute the vaccine (COVAXIN) . This vaccine has been tested and approved in Indian, Guyana, Iran, and Mexico on top of several other smaller nations. On top of that they are seeking approval for the vaccine in the United States and Canada. So as for the stock price it obviously bounced in february. Then fell experiencing a typical retraction but picked back up  with the rise of covid cases in India. This run was halted when the company disclosed it would be raising capital with a stock offering of nearly 200 million shares pegged at 0.01 that are convertible to common shares. This news resulted in the shorts piling on and bringing the stock down to around 6.50. note that the stock did not reach the previous support level at 5.52 and instead bounced well above those levels. For the final note the shorts, I know you smooth brains love squeezing shorts, and shorts this stock has. As I am writing this the percentage of float short on this stock is about 26%. This is a far cry from other meme stocks but it can provide immense buying pressure nevertheless. 

Finally for the Technical analysis, now I know some of y’all can’t really wrap your heads around things like volume, or trends, or support but bear with me and hopefully I can explain this to you. So what are the weird lines that are draw on the chart 

Red lines= A Fibonacci Retracement graph: This is to help identify POSSIBLE places of resistance and support, i placed it between the low and the high of the intraday chart

Orange lines= Triangle: I drew a triangle, I tend to draw triangles to identify possible breakouts, this particular triangle is kind of weak so I am not going to put emphasis on it 

Blue Lines= Simple moving average (20, 50, 200): I use them to identify trend reversal and breakouts usually I look for when they cross or fan out 

Cup and Handle: There appears to be a cup and handle formation forming and is visible on the 5 minute intraday chart and the 1 minute intra day 



The most important piece of this TA is the cup and handle IF earnings go well and there is a sustained breakout above 7.63 I’m in.The Trade what I plan on doing is if there is a breakout at the 7.63 level then I am going to hop into some 0DTE $8 calls I will trade them intraday day and set a stop loss for probably 7.30-7.40. If the breakout continues then the next place to watch will be the 7.78 range and if volume and volatility are increasing to the buy side I will probably begin buying some aug 21 9 calls as that is the next resistance level.

[These are just the option chain I'm looking at I haven't bought anything yet but I will update as the morning goes on](

Couple things to note: I am obviously not a financial advisor I’m just a dude with a hobby.

TLDR: People getting infected with covid, vaccine value go up, vaccine company value go up, short get squeeze value go up, potential breakout value go up 

Aug 6 $8 Call 

Aug 21 $9 Call

And maybe some shares idk

I frantically tried undoing it, but they seemed to have eventually noticed because it says the password changed. So far, nothing has changed so I don’t think the person realizes what’s going on. The $15k is set to clear on the 10th (Tuesday) and I’m thinking about this non stop because why would this happen? I emailed Robinhood about it and they haven’t replied yet.  

I posted on legal advice and the responses were lackluster, but one commenter advised me to go to WSB since whoever I’ve tried to scam would likely be retarded enough to post about it. I figure I might as well come here to get a second opinion. What do I do?

**This is not one of those times.**

As some of you already know, VIAC flew 7% today after a fantastic earnings report that blew the doors off nearly every metric. I know what you're thinking: welp, missed the boat on another one. And yes everyone, I'm the guy who posted the [10k earnings FD Yolo]( couple days ago (sold those today and rolled them into LEAPS). Today was a GOOD day - aside from forgetting to screenshot BEFORE I sold for once in my damn life, typically I do the opposite and then never actually sell and lose all of it.

But this party is literally just getting started.

On Monday, Discovery (DISCA) [drilled]( to the center of the earth off of strong earnings but dismal growth numbers, **falling 6%** and taking Viacom (which trades similarly to Discovery) along with it on the ride down. Ever since the Archegos collapse (more on that later but all of you know the Bull Hwang story by now), algos have undeservedly tied these two tickers at the hip. Subtract that undeserved 6% from today's 7% gain, and it pretty much cancels out: VIAC is **basically only up 1% off** of a truly fantastic earnings report. In fact, this stock was literally higher as recently as a week ago - and that's when earnings were a huge question mark, but no longer. For once, fellow apes would be getting in on the **GROUND FLOOR**.

**Q2 Earnings Highlights** (Don't feel compelled to read this part if you don't want to, TL;DR: they knocked it out of the park)

* Revenue: 6.56B (est 6.52B)
* Adj EPS: 0.97 (est 0.96)
* \+6.5M streaming subscribers (42M total between P+, Showtime etc)
* \+2.8M PlutoTV MAUs (52.3M total)
* \+45% watch time per user  (Roku's decreased)
* \+24% ad revenue yoy
* \+9% affiliate revenue yoy
* \+92% (!) streaming revenue yoy
* Paramount+ [officially launched in Europe]( expands in South America
* In this market you really need to pitch a perfect game to not get sold off on earnings. This was a clean sweep across the board: Viacom, priced like a value stock, just blew out all the growth stocks in growth metrics (looking at you Roku). And the best is yet to come (more on this later)

Ok let's review what Viacom even does for those who don't know. If you do know, skip this next part.

**1.** **The Business**

&amp;#x200B;

[If you haven't watched something made by one of these brands there's just simply no way you live in America. ](

Viacom basically owns every single TV channel you retards grew up watching. Nickelodeon, MTV, VH1, Comedy Central - from our childhood cartoons at Nickelodeon to the greatest comedy sketch show of all time (Chapelle's Show - no debate) to the shitty reality shows of the 2000's (Jersey Shore): Viacom owns ALL of it. It also owns Showtime which makes Billions, the unofficial TV show of WSB.

In a day and age where streaming content is at a premium, Viacom is sitting on an absolute TREASURE CHEST of content.

**How They Make Money**

* Advertising - Good old fashioned TV ads during programming (both traditional and streaming)
* Affiliate - The cut Viacom gets from the boomer retards who still pay their provider for cable TV
* Streaming Subscriptions - the 5 or 10 dollars a month from Paramount+ / Showtime
* Theatrical Releases - Did you know a Quiet Place 2 (made by Paramount) is the third highest grossing movie of the year behind Fast 9 and Black Widow? And cost a fraction of those to make? But yes, people still buy tickets to see movies (just ask the AMC apes, they know what's up).
* Licensing - Viacom doesn't keep all the content they make, they also license it out to others for LOTS of money. Much like a pimp that whores out prostitutes instead of keeping them all for his own sexual desires, VIAC is all about licensing money. HBO paid them half a BILLION for South Park. Amazon paid them 150 million for Coming 2 America, one of the shittiest sequels to a classic of all time. And as Netflix, Amazon, Apple all fight for content, fees are only going to go up. And all that money goes right back into fueling Viacom's sleeping giant: Paramount+

**Paramount Plus**

Even total retards know that traditional TV as we know is dying. Gone are the days where the whole family gathers around the tube to watch Modern Family at 9pm - these days everyone is on their own schedule, they mostly get their shows through streaming apps when they want it. More and more families are cutting the cable cord, opting instead to go with streaming apps like Netflix, Disney+, Amazon - with varying degrees of success. Streaming is the future - nothing new here.

Paramount+ is the brand spanking new streaming app that Viacom is banking on to contend with the big boys. The market has basically valued this venture at fucking zero - and you know what that was somewhat understandable: it's a crowded industry, the app hadn't existed for even a full quarter yet, the street wanted to take a ""wait and see"" approach.

Welp, Paramount just blew the fucking doors off all projections for their first full quarter and put to rest any doubts about the viability of the app. Between Paramount (and premium cable sister app Showtime), Viacom now has 42 million users, up from 36 when they last reported. And the biggest catalysts for growth are still yet to come!

Anyways, back to live TV's alleged slow death. There is one MAJOR exception to this. Sports. While we can catch our Billions episode on Tuesday night because we missed it Sunday and have basically the same experience, there is nothing more useless than a rerun of a sporting event. We need that shit LIVE, and it's basically the only kind of TV that has to be.

**Are you ready for some football?**

Did you know that the NFL accounted for 71 of the top 100 most watched live broadcasts in 2020? That's almost 75 fucking percent! In fact the NFL was responsible for $4 billion+ ad revenue for host networks in 2020 - and guess who just extended their NFL deal? When fall rolls around, P+ signups are going to fucking FLY as the CBS team broadcasts every AFC matchup this year, conveniently located in some top TV markets - Kansas City, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, and New England are all AFC / ViacomCBS territory, and all happy to look pretty decent this year unlike NFC teams New Orleans, Atlanta, and Chicago (but i'll save this convo for r/NFL).

Oh yeah, ViacomCBS also has the SEC college football rights too, the only conference in college football that even matters these days. American Football not your thing? They got the rights to real futbol too, including UEFA Champions league soccer and Serie A. More of a hoops guy? Guess who has the exclusive rights to March Madness. More of a boomer? Guess who has the PGA Tour.

With over 1000 live sporting events a year, Paramount Plus may actually be the most complete sports streaming app out there, surpassing even ESPN.

**Boomers still watch TV**

If you're reading this, take a moment to wipe the jizz off your pants from Viacom's sporting dominance as we review their more traditional businesses and check out some of these stats.

&amp;#x200B;

[Wait, you mean to tell me ONE company has the top THREE dramas, top SIX comedies, #1 news show, and the #1 most watched show in the country on TOP of the NFL, SEC, PGA, NCAA, and soccer?! Even if you're not big on this stuff, you have to recognize how impressive that is. I for one don't watch a single one of these shows, but I know a lot of middle America \/ boomer generation absolutely still live by this shit. They aren't going away any time soon, as much as we might want them to. ](

Don't believe this? Check out [Variety's report from May]( about the most-watched TV shows on TV. Sheer CBS DOMINANCE.

[I'm assuming none of us watch any of these shows anymore unless it's to find new memes for WSB, but we all have a son \/ daugher \/ stepson as product of cuckery \/ sibling who is right in the Spongebob \/ Paw Patrol \/ Peppa Pig age range. No one, not even Disney, controls THIS much essential IP for the children's market. For parents, Paramount+ isn't a luxury, it's an absolute NECESSITY to shut their kids up.  ](

The order isn't specified, but out of the [most popular children's television shows in America]( Viacom through Nickelodeon produces the vast majority of them.

Alright, enough about Paramount Plus. It's the key to VIAC's future, but we've covered enough of it. As P+ slowly begins to claim back it's IP it's licensed out to other streamers to bolster its own library and starts churning out some seriously great P+ exclusives (THE NEW [HALO]( TV SHOW for example) reasons to get the app will become more and more compelling over time - for sports fans, boomers, and parents especially. But what about for the poor people who don't want to pay even one penny for TV?

**Pluto TV**

Let me start this off by saying this: if you don't have Pluto TV, download that shit right now because it's free. Literally zero strings attached fucking free, don't even need to make an account with a fake email address, it's F R E E freeeeee. Whether or not you buy the stock, if you wasted all this time reading through all of this you will have at least gained the knowledge of the single greatest free cord cutting app ever invented.

&amp;#x200B;



But how does Viacom make any money by giving you hundreds of channels and not charging you? You guessed it: ads. This nifty free app is expected to generate [1 BILLION]( in advertising revenue for Pluto in 2021, well ahead of schedule. I have this on 8 hours a day in the background because BloombergTV is included, and it's absolutely fucking amazing. CBSHQ is a great ESPN replacement too for the sports fans that can no longer tolerate the irritating sounds of Stephen A Smith. Check it out, it's sweet. And free, you cheap fucks.

***TL;DR: Viacom is one of the most complete streaming TV stocks you can own right now, with something for everyone and strong competitive advantages in children's programming, live sports, and boomer television shows. It's the past, the present, and the future. They are taking the enormous cash flows that still continue to be generated from their linear TV business and investing the profits into the future of television: streaming - they're eating their cake and keeping it too.***

&amp;#x200B;

2. **The Competitors (If you know the streaming space intimately, skip this part too)**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Contrary to popular belief, the SVOD pie is still growing even as we come out of the pandemic, and Viacom's share \(through Showtime and Paramount+, one of the only apps above to actually GAIN market share TWO straight quarters\) is expanding as well. Notice the 4&amp;#37; DECLINE from Netflix between Q4 and Q2 2021 while Hulu and Disney have actually SHRANK as well. Time for a new sheriff in town?](

**Netflix**

Those of you who thought Netflix runs this shit like Don Corleone are severely mistaken. While an early entrant and pioneer in the streaming space, growth has been hard to come by for Netflix thanks to a declining library, a refusal to compete in live sports or news programs, and more recently, a truly [bizarre foray into mobile gaming]( As you can see, Netflix, while still #1, is in decline - as the most expensive app, they seem to be coasting more on the Netflix brand name. And on the off chance they make a show someone actually likes, it's probably [canceled](

**HBO + Discovery**

You're probably most familiar with HBO as the channel that fucked up Game of Thrones beyond repair, rendering a once global cultural phenomenon to being completely wiped out from the entire pop-culture consciousness. Discovery makes all the dogshit reality TV such as 90 Day Fiancee that is tearing down the fabric of American society. Other assets include TNT (home of Charles Barkley and I really don't know what else) and CNN (the world's leading purveyor of fake news).

Welp, they're all joining together. As of [May 17th]( Discovery is merging with WarnerMedia - a deal structured so poorly that it sent Discovery shares from the $41 it was at premarket that day down to a paltry $29.20 today. Not all mergers are created equal, and this [reverse morris trust merger]( successfully transferred AT&amp;T's HBO bags to unsuspecting Discovery shareholders, resulting in a debt-ridden entity that hopes to compete in the very long run.

I'm not going to bash Discovery too much because I do think it has a chance to be relevant down the line, but this merger isn't closing for a WHILE and there's just not a whole lot of upside for the stock in the short term. The potential of being acquired is now gone.

**Disney**

Disney has deep pockets, and Disney+ combined with Hulu and ESPN is a strong portfolio. Their dual theatrical release + Disney+ streaming release combo business model is also used by Paramount, and may prove to be the standard moving forward. Disney+ has two of the world's most valuable IP of all time in Marvel and Star Wars, so you won't catch me talking shit about them here. They're a strong player here, and is the only one that could challenge Viacom's supremacy in children's content (although IMO Paramount targets the 5+ demographic while Disney is more in the 13+ space). Then again, Disney isn't a pure play streaming stock either (Disney World, Disney Land) so it's not a perfect comparison.

**Amazon / Apple**

Both of these FAANG stalwarts have made half assed efforts to compete in the streaming space without really dedicating any sort of resources to it since they have so much other shit going on. Bezos at least pretended to care for a while, showing up to the Emmy awards and shit before getting bored and fucking off to space. Apple's AppleTV effort has been dismal to say the least, with a content library of around 50 titles and a userbase composed almost entirely of free trials that won't be renewed. More on this later.

**NBC / Peacock**The only reason to have this shit app is for Office re-runs when you invite a girl over to Netflix and Chill. Ironically Netflix actually lost the Office to its original maker (just another L in a long series of NFLX L's) but Peacock and Chill does have a better ring to it anyways. Otherwise, this app is basically useless and is the least likely to survive the streaming wars independently without some sort of merger. Which brings me to my next point.

**ROKU -** only a competitor to PlutoTV, not really a competitor to Paramount+. Have you seen their P/E multiple?

&amp;#x200B;

[Ok, I compiled the above myself and did my best to update through this quarter's ER's. It may not be ENTIRELY up to date or accurate, but I did the best I could since as far as I could tell there was nowhere else on the internet that had this info all in one place, I looked everywhere. Does not include Pluto TV, Tubi, Roku, or any of the free ad-based apps. ](

**VALUATION**

Ok, let's talk numbers, without which this is just paragraphs of drivel that no one is going to fucking read. If you apes made it this far by the way, I salute you. Here's where it gets fun. The below is sourced from a Google sheets template I built from scatch, sourcing from Google Finance and Finviz. I'll point out what I thought was noteworthy from each screen, but feel free to draw your own conclusions.

&amp;#x200B;

[Check out that 52 week high column for Viacom and Discovery vs. where they are now. If you know the Bill Hwang story, you know what happened. If you don't, scroll down for a recap. This stock can get back there, we've seen it happen. ](

[Viacom's RSI yesterday was 34 before today's ER, while it's still basically trading below all three SMA's. While these numbers are terrible, you'll see they pretty much suck across the entire sector \(check out the SMA stats on the streaming ETF\). It's a downtime for the streaming sector coming out of the pandemic with money flowing towards reopening plays, while high growth tech has been mooning thanks to a second collapse of the 10 year yield. I expect this entire sector to recover H2 2021 via sector rotation back into communications when the 10 year yield goes back up \(it's projected to double by year end\). ](

&amp;#x200B;

[The important thing to note here is institutional onwership aka \\""the smart money\\"". Viacom is a whopping 85+&amp;#37; institutionally owned - asset managers, banks, hedge funds, pension funds, you name it. The short float number isn't high so I'm not going to lie to you about short squeeze potential. You'd have to be retarded to short here at 41 rather than back at 100 anyways.   ](

&amp;#x200B;

[Yes you are reading this correctly - Viacom trades at a paltry 9 P\/E and just 1 times revneue!!! Even compared to its peers in traditional TV, this is ludicrously low. Why should FOXA be higher despite not having a paid streaming app? Why does ROKU deserve to trade at a whopping 239 P\/E and Netflix at 54 P\/E? I'm not arguing that VIAC should be anywhere near those P\/E's, but with everything it has going for it, 9 is ludicrous. You're not going to find better-hidden value than this ANYWHERE in the S&amp;P 500. Run a screen and sort by P\/E if you don't believe me.](

**3. ARCHEGOS aka Bull Hwang gets Margin Called (Skip if you know the history)**

I don't want to spend too much time on this story because all of WSB knows it for the most part. Legendary fund manager Bill Hwang blew up his account in a matter of days in true WSB fashion by being levered 20 to 1 in names such as Viacom, Discovery, Baidu, Tencent Music, IQiYi, and other assorted hilarity. With the bath that Chinese stonks have taken lately and the precipitous fall from 100 to as low as 38 in Viacom, it's easy to dismiss good old billy boy as just another retard in over his head.

But this guy saw something in Viacom. Instead of telling the entire Archegos story, i'll lay out the sequence of events as relates specifically to VIAC's share price.

[A lot of times, retards throw out random price targets that stocks will never hit in their entire existence. Here, we already know what VIAC is capable of. Sure it took a 20-1 levered Korean fund to get us there, but this glimpse to the past is actually a glimpse into our future. I'll hold off on naming an end of year price target myself though, I don't like doing that without building a full model which I just don't have the time for tonight. ](

[This chart would probably be more useful to reflect this week's price action, however since I made this whole thing from scratch it's going to take too long so fuck it. As you can see, streaming stocks have mostly all taken a breather since March. Getting in now is a classic buy low situation, something us apes really need to start trying for a change.  ](

**4. MERGER MANIA!!?**

WSB might be composed of a bunch of retards that barely know how the market work, but everyone knows this: if you own stock or options in a company and it gets bought out, it is the FASTEST and most satisfying path to tendies. Strategic acquisitions are known to pay a [much higher premium]( to what a company is trading for on the open market. There's no better way to exit a position than waking up to an alert that something you own has been acquired.

At least that's how Discovery shareholders felt the morning of May 17th before ***discovering*** they weren't getting bought out, they were getting CEO Zaslav's turd sandwich of a merger in which AT&amp;T dumped HBO and all their associated debt on Discovery shareholders, who only get a paltry 29% of the new entity while AT&amp;T holders get 71%. AT&amp;T holders fared no better as the announcement accompanied the news that AT&amp;T had to nuke their dividend to get this deal done, which was the only reason to own that POS to begin with. It was a rare deal in which everyone loses, except Zaslav himself.

But while DISCA owners were left holding their dick's, a world of possibilities were opened up for the remaining players in the streaming space to be acquired by the giants. Shortly after Amazon acquired the private MGM studios, which basically only has James Bond at this point. Much speculation ensued about whether the remaining players (VIAC, Lionsgate, AMCX, CURI) would be acquired by the giants of Netflix, Apple, Amazon, Disney etc.

I'm not going to sit here and lie to everyone and say a merger is imminent, I have no fucking clue. What I do know is Shari Redstone, chairwoman and largest stakeholder, is finally [open]( to shopping Viacom, something her father would have never considered. With a complete portfolio of sports, children's, and boomer linear, no acquisition would fix Amazon or Apple's lackluster TV efforts than Viacom. However, I don't think Viacom needs to be acquired, I think they have a legitimate shot of being a player in this space on their own.

**TL;DR We don't need to be bought out for tendies, but it sure wouldn't hurt. No acquisition would be more attractive than Viacom to immediately turn a tech giant into a streaming powerhouse. It's merely the difference between mooning sooner vs. mooning later. Either way, Shari's listening.**

**5. Analyst Price Targets**

Upgrades are coming. With earnings this good, we're already starting to see upgrades TODAY from analysts who weren't too lazy to pass in their work by EOD.

&amp;#x200B;

[Bank of America also has a 53 PT from last quarter. I would expect further upgrades from the rest of the street tomorrow. ](

Even Without accounting for the new upgrades from today or tomorrow, the average VIAC price target is still $50.34, representing a 21% upside.

**6. Conclusion**

I wanted to get into some technincal analysis of this thing (cup and fucking handle anyone???) as well as risk factors but I'm out of time, I'll save those for a Part 2. Will be happy to answer any questions in the comments.

**TL;DR: Viacom has been consolidating for over 4 months and is finally about to fucking blow the roof off after showing phenomenal growth in a space primed for industry consolidation. This is the best positioned streamer as far as IP goes, and an acquisition would moon this basically immediately (while not essential to the investment thesis, it would be nice of course).**

EDIT: This blew up more than I thought it would. I've never posted DD here before but the overwhelmingly positive reaction I've received from this has inspired me to contribute more to the community. Now, initially I was going to make a separate Part 2 post but I don't want to be seen as spamming so I'm just going to put it as a comment and add it as an edit. Besides, it's probably important to have the risk factors of the trade as part of the original post.   


**8. RISK FACTORS**

Alright everyone. Some of you read the whole thing and YOLOed. Some of you didn't read any of it and still YOLOed. Most of you probably didn't do shit. And that's ok, because I want everyone to read this next part first before deciding. 

* **The entire market could crash** like the gay bears have been promising for months. This would of course take out everything with it, and VIAC is no different. The 10% Correction gets thrown out regularly, I'm not an economist so I really don't know if or when this is going to happen - although most of us will have way bigger problems than just VIAC if that does occur. 
* **The decline of linear TV outpaces the growth of streaming.** This is the worst case scenario for Viacom: advertisers pull their dollars out of linear which has been a cash cow and reallocate them elsewhere (i.e. NOT streaming), leaving Viacom underfunded for P+ growth. I must acknolwedge the potential risk of this even though I assign a very low probability to this in the short term since Viacom just completed the [best ad buying upfront they've ever had]( That article is a good read because it's not just Viacom tooting its own horn, it's the entire industry! If anything it paints a fairly rosy picture of where the money is flowing. 
*  **The P+ app fails to gain traction**. Paramount plus has seen two straight quarters of new user growth while Disney and Netflix have actually declined. However, it's certainly easier to gain new users when you're app is new. We don't know if something will keep growing at the rate it has. Reddit and Twitter do have their fair share of people bitching about the P+ app as far as content availability (some seasons of some shows are still [licensed out]( to competitors and the short term) and bugs (the Playstation app is apparently abysmal while the other apps work much better - I've never had an issue on my Samsung or Fire apps). The bottom line is that while P+ has the same growing pains of any new app, the devs do need to figure their shit out, do their fucking job, and keep complaints at a minimum. 
* **Competition** \- The competitors in this space have DEEP pockets. All 5 FAANG names have some sort of video platform, Netflix is of course the leader here, and Apple and Amazon have at least made half assed attempts to be players in this space. A strategic shift from either Apple or Amazon to suddenly start pumping cash into these efforts could prove to be a threat for the survival of Viacom as a viable independent player. The silver lining here however is that should they choose to do that (Apple especially has done basically jack shit) - the easiest way to suddenly increase their position would actually be to buy Viacom's vast IP.  
* **Merger.** But wait, wouldn't a merger be a good thing like you said earlier before? Not always, and unfortunately Discovery already laid a very recent, very relevant blueprint for why not all deals are good deals are shareholders. I've seen a similar deal pitched in which Comcast unloads NBC Universal onto Viacom in a reverse morris trust merger; I would expect that to do to our share price what the Warner deal did to Discovery's. If we are going to get acquired, it better be all cash or all stock, and at a valuation that reflects our true value. I think Shari Redstone is actually our friend on this, she won't screw us the same way Zaslav fisted his shareholders. Conversely, if Viacom suddenly decides they want to be a buyer rather than a seller, history dictates that it's the acquiree's share price that moons while the acquirer's share price that takes a hit. There's no guarantee that the long-established 38 price floor will hold in the event of strategic M&amp;A. Given the [ludicrous valuation]( Hello Sunshine just got, I would much rather be a seller than a buyer in this market. 
* **Dividend.** In my infinite retardation I somehow managed to forget to mention this stock pays a fucking healthy dividend too, which is probably a factor as to why we have so much institutional ownership. A dividend cut of course would hurt the share price. I see the probability of this as basically near zero, the balance sheet looks pretty good right now. 
* **The Options Pinning Theory**. A lot of people are claiming this stock only exists to kill weekly options, but on most weeks I don't see enough open interest for that to actually be worth it for MM's. One thing is certain though, all calls bought after Archegos expecting a bounce to the 80-100 range got nuked. Thus far, call selling has been a more profitable trade than call buying MOST of the time. While personally I think shares and leaps look like the play here (my position currently reflects that also), any time this thing dips below 40 is when to go in with FD's as it very rarely spends too much time below there. For the more conservative investor, SELLING 38 puts is literally free money. 
* **Archegos -** Some say there is an Archegos curse, that nothing in the Korean hedge fund is ever going to moon again. I mean this is some voodoo shit but I feel like it has to be included here. The Chinese stocks he held are obviously down for entirely different reasons right now, and it just hasn't been a hot time for the value / comm trade, something I expect to reverse H2. 
* **The Growth Trade Never Fucking Ends.** As most of us know the tech trade was basically left for dead earlier in the year as shares of tech stocks tumbled as the ten year yield started to rise up steadily. This trade has reversed, and all the money has since gone back into tech, particularly the megacaps. The growth trade has been at the expense of the value trade, and make no mistake about it, ***VIAC IS A VALUE TRADE (LOOK AT THE P/E). It's listed on the NASDAQ, but don't call this a tech stock, it's a communications stock***. While it does look like the ten year yield has stopped drilling with today's nice bounce, there's no guarantee it doesn't once again reverse. However, I have a really difficult time seeing it going below 1%, and I'd be the whole house on the fact it ends the year closer to 2% than 1%. As the yield goes back up, they will shift the money from the growth trade back into value, which benefits VIAC. 
* **SPEAKING OF ALGOS** \- What does it mean to be heavily institutionally owned? Share price movements are more algo-induced from the big boys. They'll trade many stocks together simultaneously in the same industry, which at times can be unfortunate if you're grouped together with subar competitors. Layer a VIAC chart over DISCA between May and yesterday and you'll see what I mean, when one goes down so does the other. Today's price movement has been encouraging though, I have never seen VIAC green while DISCA is red I think ever. A decoupling here would be fantastic. 
* **The 38 Price Floor I believe in might not hold -** for all the reasons I included above, shit could go south, but this floor has stood the test of time and all sorts of wild shit this year. If it can survive the greatest margin call in history, and every retest after that, then this 38 floor is safer than any other investment I can think of since I don't know the floors of any other stock. But something only works until it doesn't right? So I'm including this as a risk factor since much of the thesis is based upon it. 
* **TL/DR:** There are risks to this trade as there are with any trade, and from the above it's wiser to go with a longer term trade in LEAPS form as much of this stuff takes longer to develop. I'd only go FD's if it dips below 40 as it doesn't spend much time below it. But when factoring in the growth potential, the safety of the 38 floor, the dividend, and the acquisition potential, this play really does have it all for me. Trade safely apes.

Today trading was halted at least twice as shares spiked from $7.50 to around $11.50. Avg volume has been 180k and today was 28 Million! This was due to [this CNBC report]( that dropped today, some calling it a pump and dump, as shares quickly dropped under $9 once trading resumed. 


Goldman Sachs initiated [coverage]( yesterday with a neutral rating and $10 target. 


Also, mid-July, ""With a Buy rating, Jefferies initiated coverage on Nautilus Biotechnology Inc (NASDAQ:NAUT). The price target seems to have been set at $13.00 for Nautilus Biotechnology.""


Earnings are expected on August 10th. 


*So What Is It?*

From the cnbc article: ""Nautilus has built a prototype for a device that can measure the human proteome, a set of proteins in the body that, unlike the genome, is constantly changing based on food consumption and other factors.
Companies such as Thermo Fisher Scientific produce mass spectrometers, but those devices can be expensive and and only yield a small percentage of proteins from a drop of blood, Sujal Patel, co-founder and CEO of Nautilus, said in an interview. The company wants to become capable of measuring more than 95% of the proteome.
Organizations could use the system for drug discovery, as well as clinical diagnostics and precision medicine. In 2020 Roche-owned Genentech agreed to use Nautilus' system, and the companies plan to publish their research findings. Nautilus expects its first revenue in 2022 and is targeting a long-term operating margin of 25% to 30%. Patel, formerly co-founder CEO of data-storage hardware company Isilon, which EMC acquired in 2010 for $2.3 billion, said Nautilus will sell its instruments along and provide cloud-based software.""


The article continues with some of its uses. 


Personally, I've been tracking this company since last year, and was excited to finally be able to invest in them. I've lost about $1,000 in expired options, there's very little volume on average. I was hoping for a jump once they went public but oh well. I sold all my shares today for a profit at $11.50 (phew, those bags were getting heavy lol), then bought another hundred about an hour later at $8.75. I'll begin accumulating again. 


This is definitely a long term speculative play, but I think this is exactly the kind of ""disruptor tech"" that growth investors get excited for, and with their first earnings report next week on 8/10, the shares are looking pretty inexpensive at the moment. 


Good luck out there!

Got an interesting pay to consider here. This is based off of  [**epicoliver3**]( DD on MCFE.

Take a look at the following double calendar spread:  40c Aug/Sep and 25p Aug/Sep. At a 2 to 1 ratio of calls to puts, the B/E is 23 and 54 with profit peaking at 40 with another little pop around 25. The risk reward ratio is almost 10:1 with over a 90% probability of it being ITM.

There's no guarantee it'll land in the sweet spot and the whole div and volatility may make for a rough ride, but come expiration, it only has to land above 23 to not lose money - and it's been above 23 for the past 4 months.

[Currently, only Maryland has passed this bill]( but states like Texas, NY, and West Virginia are trying to push it through as well.

IMO, if this becomes a countrywide standard, this is gonna be a huge fine on a bunch of companies like Google, FB, Amazon, etc. The worst part is the tax **(EDIT: bracket)** is calculated on gross TOTAL revenue:

ex. If I made $3 bajillion selling oranges and 50 cents selling ads, the tax would be calculated ~~on a percentage of $3 bajillion and 50 cents.~~  on the 50 cents from selling ads, but how much you're taxed is based on the $3 bajillion and 50 cents.

**EDIT: I can't read.** the tax is imposed on the amount you earned from the digital ads, but the tax rate depends on your global annual revenue. So it's not as stupid, but still pretty stupid. A little more faith in our government, a lot less faith in my reading comprehension

These companies could offload the tax onto their customers but that would probably deter customers and less companies will want to rent ads from bigger companies (if they make more money in total, the added charge will be higher)

This will probably be a long term play (first actual tax will occur April next year) but my ape ass is looking for ways to play this and I can't think of anything below surface level.

If this is already too much words, don’t worry, I’ll be brief – and before you close this post because there are no rocket emojis, this is a play that might not have the moonshot potential you live for, but will yield annual bananas for years to come.  So, on to the stock, and more words for you to not read. 

Lumen Technologies

First off – what does this company do?  I typically like to google companies first, before investing.  They have a website, so that checks out.  I think they sell phones or something.  Their website talks about edge computing.  That’s future stuff.   

Either way – they make money selling their current telecommunications services, and a lot of it.  Net Income of $506 million this quarter (even with decline in sales).  Earnings per share $0.46 for the quarter.  Some more rambling about EBITDA and free cash flow, that I don’t understand.  But here is the ½ punch:

Board approved an up to $1 billion Stock Repurchase Program over two years

$1 billion in dividend payouts

For a company with a market cap just under $13 billion, that’s like a 16% locked in return.  (Can someone double check that?  Just an ape, am bad at math)

Seriously – after the 8% decline yesterday post-earnings, it seems like a pretty good price/entry-point for a company that is committed to returning value to their stockholders, is selling chunks of their business to raise capital for forays into more modern technology services.  They could turn things around – unlike the vast majority of tech startups and hopefuls, they already make fucking money.

TLDR

If I wasn’t brief enough, my assertion is this:  the market overreacted (it’s a model of efficiency) to their Q2 earnings report/declining sales, and this solid dividend earner is on sale.  Value plays aren’t your style, and I know you’re retarded, but you will still need a way to eat if when your out-of-the-money GME calls expire worthless.  No lambos here, but it will afford you the means to purchase bananas with the dividends for the rest of your life (or at least until all the people with landline phones die, whichever comes first).  So you won’t starve to death...which is always nice.

Its last earning surprise and its great growth guidance led the price to go 30% up. Additional bullish news about MacPro is also boosting this price up with 4x higher volume.

However, we all gotta know that we always need to ""sell the news"", and ""sell the greed"" in order to make profits(especially options) because realistically, institutions and big hands have better models, connections, business relationships, and platforms which bring the fastest and newest information to them so they can take their profits out faster than one another. Most stocks are already priced in when its bullish news comes out, and I think AMD would not be an exception.

Reasons:

1. The price is already too high, Quarterly RSI:82, 40 P/E, (Remember, Nvidia is still strong enough to keep their #1 position for a while).
2. 76% owned by institutions (most of us can't buy or sell faster than them. Too risky to fight with them. That is why ""sell the news"", and ""sell the greed"" became quotes for retail investors aka ants).
3. The current market sentiment is not bullish enough. We all know that the whole market went up too much since the COVID due to low interest rate and stimulus checks. Institutions and big hands all perceive that there will be a huge correction before the end of this year, but they can't start a big sell off now because thankfully the Fed and retail investors are helping them to take little more profits before they eventually start selling off. Therefore, I think AMD's current price rise was high enough to be the peak before it drops.

[sourced by \\""forecasts.org\\""](

As you can see by this forecasts, S&amp;P 500 index keeps decreasing from August 2021 to January 2022, and then bouncing back from February 2022. It is just a forecast, but if the Fed says they will actually start considering about tapering in next year or something, there will be a high chance that the market goes down like this forecast values.

4. AMD needs a healthy correction before it goes up again. Every stock needs a correction in order to prevent its froth.

To make a long story short, this isn't Krispy Kreme's first foray into the stock market. To make a long story short, Krispy Kreme got into incredibly hot water after they were unable to meet their expected earnings and well...just didn't publish them. 

That's right, they basically gave up and just didn't publish their earnings which were less than stellar. This obviously spooked off investors and after sentiment turned against them they pulled the ticker and went private in 2016.

Fast forward to 2021, and they are back under the new ticker symbol $DNUT. So why am I bullish on a company known for their last play in stocks being a disaster? 

WHY I'M BULLISH: 

Krispy Kreme was already in bad sights around the time of their IPO debut. Between their scandal leading into the 2016 pull, over expansion, and sales of in store boxes doing poorly it all lead up to a tough patch for KK. But lately, that's all been turning around almost immediately after going private. So what's changed? 

- purchase by JAB: Well known and successful JAB handles large institutional clients such as Panera bread, Keurig, and Dr Pepper Snapple Group which are all insanely successful. At $20 a share (currently $5 under the current new listing price) it net them a whopping $1.35b as a company. 

-increased revenues: since bottoming out in 2009, which was a hard time for basically any company, they have seen increased revenue significantly and concisely every quarter since. This trend doesn't show any signs of stopping and with earnings coming up 8/17 they are expected to smash those to a new ATH since 2009. 

Aggressive expansion: They ramped down on expansions in 2006-2009 amid the financial crisis and their own accounting crisis. Since then they have been steadily expanding every year and are up to 1,400 stores worldwide. 

INSIDER BUYING: Since their IPO they have seen two very significant large buy ins taking place in mid July.  This signals a massive bullish sentiment for the stock in the company. Goudet Olivier chairman of the company personally added 294,118 shares to his position on 7/8 with parent company JAB increasing their stake by a whopping 2,882,353 around the same time in July. 

RETURN OF THE MAC: Before $KKD's sale into private, the stock was trading at an average price of $20-$21. This number was bolstered and solidified by JAB's purchase of $KKD at a set price of $20 a share. This purchase happened in 2016 and it's safe to say based on net income and revenue that Krispy Kreme is at least as strong if not stronger as a company as it was at the time of that sale. This means that the current value of $15 is $5 UNDER their established value historically. This makes $DNUT IMO one of the best value plays out right now that a recently launched ticker could possibly have. 

All in all, $DNUT stands to be a great value play at these current levels, and with earnings company up in couple of weeks now is a fantastic time to buy in.",Give em D(eez)NUT(s): The rising Phoenix $DNUT,13,13

Here’s the deal, my DD is still accurate. We are at the very beginning of a major space race between the US and China and the US seems to want to use private contracts instead of expensive and heavily politicized/decentralized nasa contracts with like 50 expensive companies (which is why they’ve been mired down with bureaucracy for decades). ASTR has secured this contract which is huge, but the upcoming first military launch will prove the company and continue the upward momentum. Rocket Lab has this catalyst going for it, and many others. It’s absolutely a better, more diversified, more proven, and more consistent launch provider then Astra which is why I have hella options in that one too (currently ticker VA CQ).

I came onto Astra and Rocket Lab because I love space, not with my investment mind (I do my gambling on the side, like a true addicted degenerate). It’s because of the substance and significance of the companies that I think they are great investments. Rocket Lab is a visionary genius of a company that will do great things, and Astra is a classic smart people applying their NASA expertise with a businessman leading the way that is likely to print for a while. 

These companies are very likely to go to the moon, 100% literally, in the next decade, and so they are great long term holds and plays. But they are also phenomenal short term plays because big money is nervous and unsure about the sector. Big money is not a geeky fan of space, they would not have the background to understand how big these companies are likely to be. They aren’t dumb, so they are picking up on the idea, but for now while the word “SP AC” is keeping most institutional money at bay, retail has a hell of an opportunity to buy up some dirt cheap options (well at least on Rocket Lab, Astra is still cheap but obviously a lot more expensive today then yesterday) and some really cheap, low valuation stocks for either short term plays once people wake up about their true value, or as long term plays as that value happens in the real world. 

Imagine thinking a space tourism company like $SPAC is worth $10 billion when these companies who are set up for a decade of growth similar to the internet boom are worth around $1 billion. Even that gap is a 10x return but both of these companies will be closer to (though definitely not the same as) the valuation of SpaceX which is over $75 billion. Y’all can do the math. 

Y’all I invest in things that I know, I invested in Tesla in 2014 (in 7th grade, so not a whole lot of money), I invested in Moderna at the beginning of last year (though I sold early like an idiot) and ya boi rode the waves of GME and AMC all the way down and then back up to a tidy profit. If y’all want to gamble, you could do MUCH worse then Rocket Lab and Astra.

Sailpoint is in the identity governance space.  Similar to Okta, but not a direct competitor.  In fact, they are partnered together now and Sailpoint integrates nicely with Okta([  Sailpoint is best in the industry when it comes to Identity Governance &amp; Administration for huge enterprise.  Okta focuses more on workforce identity, though there is sure to be more and more overlap especially with the Auth0 acquisition.  But with the increasing shift to working from home, the identity space is huge and growing.

Okta's 2020 revenue was $586M, and its market cap at the time of writing is 33B (\~56x revenue).

Sailpoint's 2020 revenue was $365M, and its market cap is currently less than 5B (\~14x revenue).

The stock is below its all time high of $62 earlier in the year (currently trading at $50) and with Q2 earnings next week (releasing Aug 9th) I think it could be a huge catalyst to set new all time highs and start trading at a premium closer to Okta's.  At 42x revenue the stock price would be $150 and even then their market cap would be less than $15B.

There are a few catalysts that could drive the price in both directions, hard to say where but i will share the info.

1. Revenue
- H1 and Q2 2021 will beat H1 and Q2 2020 due to Covid and new state launches but will not smash Q1 2021. 
- They lost market share in many states and they also had lower margin
- igaming (online casino) did ok but no spectacular growth there
- MI might help as they launched at the end of Jan so that gives them now a full extra month to compare vs Q1

I would not be surprised if revenue grows by single digit or low two digits vs Q1 2021.

2. Things I don't care about:
- New marketplace and social features - these do not drive growth.

3. What they will say and what actually matters:
- They completed the migration from Kambi a few weeks ago with no real issues, going forward they can save 2-6% out of the sportsbetting revenue as they will not pay a platform fee. Also they will be able to build more features and they own their own stack.
- They launched Same Game Parlay and that will help them with margin. All of their main competitors have this and DKNG has been suffering from this gap.
- New States: Arizona and Connecticut will launch this year, CT will be meaningful as it has also igaming and it's a two horse market, them and FanDuel.
- NY: they will announce that they will take part in the NY RFA and that they believe they will get a license. The results will be announced in December and I believe it will give the stock a boost, even if only temporary.

McAfee announced a special dividend of $4.50 per share which is INSANE considering the stock is only $29

As we get closer to August 13th, the stock will go up as people buy shares to get that dividend. Options are cheap and this has not even been priced in since the stock has only gone up 81 cents since the announcement!

McAfee's stock has low liquidity with an average trading volume of 450,000 shares. A higher trading day of 900,000 shares made this thing go up almost 7%! If people start buying heavy for the dividend, this thing will go to the MOOON

This play doesn’t require McAfee to have solid fundamentals or any other boomer r/investing words, it just takes advantage of people being greedy and buying in to get the dividend.

My strategy is to buy a mix of $25, $30, and $35 call options and sell these before August 13th because people will sell their shares after they are eligible for the $4.5 dividend.

Why is Context Logic valued at just a market cap of 8Bn while ETSY is at 21Bn and SHOPIFY at a whopping 187Bn.

I took the liberty of checking valuation cap to revenue ratios and noticed the following:

WISH - Revenue $3.2Bn - Cap to Rev: 2.5

ETSY - Revenue $21Bn - Cap to Rev: 8.9

and guess what with all the pumping from certain subscription based e-magazines and websites, Shopify is at:

Revenue - 3.8Bn and Cap to Rev: 49.2 :/

Even Amazon doesnt have that level of Cap to Rev like Shopify has and the Wish Revenues are marginally lower than Shop's yet the Wish is largely undervalued (in terms of Cap to Rev ratios) by almost 3.5 times against ETSY, 5 times against Amazon and a whopping 24 times against SHOPIFY.

To be fair, fundamentally, WISH is cash rich, has been experiencing growing revenues and have started to cut costs. With them hiring former Google and Amazon executives, I do think they are going in a great place into the developing their own logistics and warehousing and potentially entering the cloud computing industry.

### A security analytics software firm with an already well established customer base will continue to grow based on increasing demand for their service and a transition to a SaaS model.

&amp;#x200B;

[Cognyte logo](

## Company Overview

**Market cap at publishing: $1.77B**

**Price at publishing: $26.86**

Cognyte Software is a global leader in security analytics software. They provide services to governments and enterprises worldwide. The company's open software is used to successfully identify, neutralize, and prevent national security, personal safety, business continuity, and cyber threats. They have over a thousand governmental and private clients. Cognyte Software was incorporated in 2020 as a spinoff of one of Verint’s business units and is headquartered in Herzliya, Israel.

## Financials

The company was just spun off in March 2021 so there won’t be any in-depth analysis on their financials or growth. I prefer not to compare the current stand-alone company with the past when they were still part of Verint as I believe they will do much better now as a separate entity and it won’t be fair. Most of the in-depth analysis will be done on the stock price and how it compares to the rest of the industry. However, here are some financial highlights from their latest filing:

[Cognyte growth taken from their presentation](

* Solid growth in the double digits across many metrics
* Profitable with earnings of $14.2M for 2020
* Solid balance sheet includes $54M in cash and $285M in equity
* Positive annualized free cash flow of $103M for 2020

## The Stock, I Like It

CGNT which is currently trading at $26.86 has a market cap of $1.7B. The stock is down 3% since its inception and is still 24% off its 52 week high of $33.37. I am comparing them with two other analytical software firms, Palantir and Fireye. Palantir is more of a general software firm that processes data across many industries while Fireye focuses on security like Cognyte.

[Comparing Cognyte stock to Palantir and FireEye](

You’re not seeing things, Cognyte Software is highly undervalued compared to its peers. Yes, it appears Palantir is overvalued but maybe it’s not, after all, Palantir’s price has been steady for almost a year now. My point is that if Palantir is fairly valued or even close to it then the price of Cognyte Software should be **$137.93**!. That would be nice but let’s not get ahead of ourselves, it’s more likely that Palantir is overvalued than fairly valued. However, even compared against its closely related peer FireEye, Cognyte still looks cheap. Even more so when you consider that Cognyte is actually profitable and neither FireEye nor Palantir are and FireEye has a higher D/E ratio.

## Outlook

I think Cognyte Software is in a fantastic position to grow based on several factors including:

* They have a large customer base of over 1000 clients, 87% of which are governments who always pay their bills on time and like to stick to something when it works
* Over two decades of experience providing a complicated service with a high barrier to entry
* The ever-growing complexity of cyberattacks will demand more complex solutions like those provided by Cognyte
* Their transition to a SaaS business model is going well as recurring revenue is already up 17% YoY
* They are Israeli and those guys are smart with computers and stuff
* Their commitment to tackling the challenge of successfully investigating ""internet money"" transactions

C’mon, did you think I wasn’t going to throw in a picture of an internet money coin and not say the big “c” word? This company is a buy based on this image alone. /s

[Entering an interesting market that shall not be named here](

## Valuation

I use Damodaran’s DCF analysis using free cash flow to firm to come up with a valuation. Here are the assumptions I made about future cash flows and all other inputs. Sorry, I know it’s not the prettiest but there is a method to my madness. The present value I get from my analysis is $2.9B or $44.87/share which, compared to the current price would represent a discount of 70%.

&amp;#x200B;

[Cognyte DCF analysis](

## Price Target

I have a price target of **$44.87** on Cognyte Software. 

**TL;DR:** Good company making smart decisions in a great industry that will undoubtedly continue to grow over the years.

I'm primarily looking at shares (I've been fucked too many times with options...), but might also buy some longer DTE options as well as FDs.

# Part 0: Short Squeeze

This isn't the main reason I'm buying, but the short interest on $FSLY is definitely worth noting and is high enough to trigger a squeeze.  We're looking at about 20% short interest [\[1\]](  

# Part 1: Company Profile and Market Overview

Fastly is a cloud computing company.  One of their main services is a CDN, which is basically how you're able to load up anime titties 10 minutes before you go to sleep.  Additionally, they have some cybersecurity operations as well, coming from a subsidiary they acquired in August 2020 for about $700M (cash + stock).

Before getting into their numbers, I'd like to talk about their most recent earnings shitshow.  At time of writing, the stock is down almost 20% after some bad forward guidance.  For the full year of 2020 Fastly called for an adjusted loss of -$0.65 to -$0.57 EPS and revenue of $340 to 350m. This is against an original analyst expectation of -$0.43 on $382m in revenue.  The main reason for this is that FSLY had an outage that lasted for about an hour and affected companies like Reddit, NYT, and Twitch, among others.  Keep in mind that Fastly reported this issue on June 8, yet from the week June 7 to June 14, the stock rally about 13%.  Rather bizarre, as you'd think this would have tanked the stock then.  What I take from this is that initially the market underestimated the impact of the outage and is now overestimating it.  Overall, the outage is a valid cause for concern, and you should take into account whether or not you trust FSLY to fix its shit going forward.

Now lets get down to the fundamentals.  FSLY has show solid revenue growth, of \~40% since 2017.  Even though that should drop to 20% this year, that still represents solid growth.  Additionally, if you think that the outage was a one-off event, then presumably we can expect to go back to that juicy 40% annual revenue growth.  It's also worth drawing attention to FSLY's total asset growth which has gone up 10x from 2017 to 2020.

With respect to Cloud Computing, I'm sure most of us know that this is an industry that's going to generate a lot of wealth.  The industry has a CAGR of \~18% over the next several years.  Additionally, the market is already estimated anywhere from $200-300b (as of this year).  Most big tech companies have spent huge amounts of money on their cloud computing efforts (see Amazon, Google, Microsoft, etc.).

# Part 2: Analysts are (were?) bullish

The average price target of FSLY is around $52, representing \~50% upside from the current price of $35 [\[2\]](  Now, it should be noted that price targets may not have baked in the bad guidance and outage, but it should also be noted that historically FSLY has traded well above $50.

Honestly, I don't really pay to much attention too much attention to analysts, but it's nice confirmation bias.

Yes Adam, everyone knows investing in China is risky, that's obviously priced in and we don't need your ""expert"" opinion.

# Summary

Very simple negative EV trade, these don't come up often and are hard to find, but [historically have been consistently lucrative]( especially in a name as liquid as $EDU traded on the NASDAQ:

* Price: \~$2.00 USD (8/5/21 morning)
* Shares out: 1.7b
* Cash + Equiv: $6b (1.6 cash, 1.1 term deposits, 3.3 ST investments)
* Gross Debt: $2b (0.5 current lease + 1.2 LT lease + 0.3 LT debt)
* Negligible minority interest and prefs

# EDU has $4b of net cash but trades at $3.4b (-$600m EV)

**Positions:**

* 10,000 shares EDU
* 80 EDU call options (WSB doesn't let you say which exact contract but \~4,000 total delta)
* 5,000 shares HKG:9901 (same company but HK listing)

# Thesis

Obviously mispriced asset. Say what you will about China stonks, Chinese education stonks, VIEs, yadda yadda NONE of that is as relevant as CASH.

&gt;**You're paying $3.4b for a $4b net cash shell on the balance sheet. Regardless of what the company actually does, you've got a cushion.**

That doesn't make sense because it doesn't. In my 5+ years I've only personally stumbled upon 2 cases like this: $EVE.LN and $LK (yup, that LK). Literally any ""not shitstorm"" news would make this pop WAY more than just the $4b of net cash on the balance sheet, which is available to you at $3.4b for no reason other than people are selling into shit-tier China sentiment they read on Twitter without ever taking an Accounting 101 class (inb4 watch this unfold live in the comments).

Here's the scoop on EDU, and historical examples of how much LK and EVE popped in the next year after they went into negative EV land.

# Why this situation exists

Fundamentals don't really matter for this trade (it's just a market inefficiency), but as background: New Oriental Education (EDU) is a Chinese company that has 7 business lines, the largest of which (66-75% of their $4b revenue) is private tutoring. As you know for-profit private tutoring has recently been banned in China because of several reasons (won't go into detail but mostly around cost of education, ethics, widening wealth gap, low birth rate).

# Why it's a lucrative trade

None of the above is really that important. Here's what important:

1. **87% of EDU ownership is institutional, and most of that is US institutions.**  
This is important because common shareholders are less likely to get completely screwed because of poor geo-political optics. Despite what American news tells you, American and Chinese LPs are both balls deep in each other and both care oh so very much about optics so it's unlikely common equity gets TOTALLY screwed over.
2. **25-33% of EDU's $4b of revenue is still legal.**  
Keep in mind tutoring is only 66-75% of EDU's $4b run rate revenue that's been outlawed, the other 25% (language, admissions consulting, bookstores, school tours etc.) is still perfectly legal.
3. **EDU has a TON of residual ""assets"" to pivot with.**  
69k employees, 10.6m student enrollments, 118 schools, 1,625 learning centers, 11 bookstores. They could start a god damn car wash tomorrow with assets like that, but whatever this $4b cash shell becomes, it's not worth -$600m, or even remotely close to $0 for that matter.

So it's clear that EDU is not worth $0, much less negative $600m. What can happen from here on? [Here's the only study from the CFA Institute (albeit from 2013) I could find on negative EV trading performance](

&gt;**The average 1-year return of 2,613 negative EV opportunities over 40 years was 50.4%.**

Looking good so far. But let's look to 2 recent examples I've traded through first hand for guidance:

# $LK (up 15x from negative EV)

Now trading OTC as $LKNCY. This is the best comparable out there imo: Luckin Coffee, a Chinese fraud that got exposed, got sold to negative EV at a low of $0.95 in May 2020, traded up to high of $15.65 (up 17x) and today on 8/3/2021 trades at $14 (up 15x in 15 months).

# $EVE.LN (up 6x from negative EV)

Eve Sleep. British mattress shitco trading on a shitty exchange (AIM). Traded to lows of 1.15 GBP in May 2020 due to COVID and grazed negative EV land--promptly re-rated to 6 GBP (up 5x) by September 2020 and peaked at 7 GBP (up 6x) in February 2021. Still trading at 3.30 GBP today.

# Conclusion

It's a cash shell worth $4b trading at $3.4b. Don't overthink the whole ""CHYNA"" deal everyone knows it's risky so it's fully priced in.

DYODD.

So what is Magnachip.  Magnachip, $MX, is a semi-conductor company based in South Korea that produces OLED display drivers as well as power management integrated circuits.  Their OLED tech goes into smartphones, TVs, as well as automobiles.  Their power integrated circuits are used in automotive, 5g, and the energy industry. The company pulled in about 500M in revenue last year and has been around for 15 years and owns a portfolio of approximately 1,200 registered patents and pending applications.  So it's not a non-sense vapor-ware company.





# Why Magnachip

Magnachip is supposedly such a good investment that two firms have offered to buyout Magnachip one at $29 and one at $35.

* Wiseroad Capital offered to buy the firm at at $29:



* Cornucopia Investment Partners offers to buy the firm at $35:

The reason why $MX is trading at $21 right now as opposed to $29 is because the US government (as well as South Korean government) has stepped in to 'review' this buyout.  They don't want to lose another semiconductor company to China.  Wiseroad Capital is a Chinese private equity firm.  And China = Very Bad.  So buying $MX means you take on the risk that the deal falls through cuz US gov thinks China = Bad.

**With that said, even with that risk, IMO, it makes sense to buy $MX** ^(🚀🚀).  Here are a few reasons.

* I already mentioned that big boy professionals value this stock at $29 and $35.  This isn't some random analyst saying it should be worth $X.  This is an actual offer and someone is willing to drop billions on this company.  With that said, even without the offers do some Googling and you can see that average price target for $MX is around $26.
* The merger announcement with Magnachip occurred at the end of March 2021 (although some say there had been whispers since January), sending $MX from about $20 to $26.  **We are now basically at the same price PRIOR to the merger announcement**.  And if you think the whispers occurred in Jan (I can't find any articles, then pre-merger price is $18).  The press release cites $18.83. Regardless, either most people think that the merger is not going to happen, or this stock is a victim of the tech/small cap crash we've seen in the past month.  But we are basically at pre-merger prices.
* $MX already accepted a deal from Wiseroad and it is just subject to review.  According to SA, If the merger is terminated because, MX accepts a superior proposal, it would be required to pay $42.1 million (roughly 3 percent of the transaction value) to Wise Road. If the deal is terminated for the following, Wise Road is required to pay MX the respective termination fee: $70.2 million (5 percent) for failing to receive U.S. regulatory approval, $84.3 million (6 percent) for failure to receive South Korean regulatory approval, and $105.3 million (7.5 percent) for any other reason notwithstanding U.S. and South Korean approvals.  **In OTHER WORDS, even IF, the deal falls through, $MX will get paid.**
* Also, even if this deal falls through, it's not unlikely that another investment firm will try to buy out $MX.  Or, $MX just does so well in the next few years that it eventually trades at $29.

Do I think the deal will go through?  Honestly, I'm just an ape so no idea.  But note that most of Magnachip's sales are to Samsung as well as to companies in China.



Meaning, it rarely sells to companies in the US.  In other words, from a trade and technological standpoint, the US doesn't stand to lose much if China does end up owning the company.  South Korea, could stand to lose out.  But Wiseroad was willing to give up 84M if South Korea does not approve the deal.

**So when is the deal expected to go through**?  Some say by the end of this year.  But recently, the US announced that it plans to be done with it's part of the review by 9/13.



As for when South Korea will be done?  Who knows.  I'd imagine it would be shortly after .  OR, South Korea may have even been ok with it in the first place, and are just waiting for the US.  Who knows.

But the deadline to keep in mind is 9/13, and obviously it could be A LOT SOONER.  Personally, I'm thinking, if the buyout gets OKed, $MX goes to $26 after confirmation and then goes to $29 eventually.  But, if it falls through, it'll probably fall to $18 or so and then it may eventually be bought out for even more!  Someone was willing to pay $35 at one point.

Now, using this knowledge, combined with my extreme autism and a dash of confirmation bias. I believe this is the next move for RH. 

Why else would they have recently launched their IPO. Could it be because RobinHood is a shady company that robs people of their money and is under legal pressures after the events of the last year; that is possible. But I don't care, because my only interest is the share price of the stock, and the number of zero's at the end of my bank balance.

Today on Mad Money, a caller phoned in asking Cramer what his thoughts were on the vertically integrated battery manufacturing juggernaut Microvast. Shockingly, he had never heard of them or didn’t know enough about them to form an opinion. So, he left the question unanswered. Now, Cramer LOVES fellow EV battery competitor QuantumScape. In fact he’s even had their CEO on his show several times! So just for you Cramer, and anyone else unfamiliar with the company, here's a little comparison of the two companies:

Microvast is a leading global provider of next-generation battery technologies for commercial and specialty electric vehicles. They supply fast charging power systems capable of 0-100% charge in 10-30 minutes, with the highest margin of safety in the industry (have never had a battery fire). 

Market Cap - 
Microvast: $2.6 billion ($800 million being cash)
QuantumScape: $9.1 billion

Microvast is currently trading at a 4 times discount to QuantumScape, despite already having actual clients, revenue, and production. I’m not arguing QS should be worth less. I’m just saying if MVST is an already established company, and the market likes QS at 10 billion, shouldn't it love MVST at 2.5 billion?

Revenue - 
Microvast: 
2021 - $230 million 
2022 - $448 million
2023 - $751 million
2024 - $1,080 million
2025 - $1,500 million
QuantumScape: 
2021-2024 …. No revenue
2024 - $14 million..?
2026 - $275 million!

By the time QS makes $275 million, Microvast will be making billions of dollars yearly. Again I'm not saying this makes QS overvalued, I’m just arguing this makes Microvast SEVERELY undervalued.

Production Facilities - 
Microvast: 
China - Factory located in Huzhou (operational)
Germany - Factory located in Berlin (operational)
United States - Factory in Clarksville, Tennessee (being built not yet in production)
R&amp;D plant in Orlando Florida (I'll get more into this later as this is where things get interesting)
QuantumScape: 
United States - Plant in San Jose, California 

As you can see Microvast is an established multinational corporation with production all over the globe. Coincidentally, the two largest automotive manufacturing countries in the world are China and the United States, Germany being the 4th. All countries Microvast operates out of. 

Solid State - 
This is where I think it gets interesting for Microvast. Everyone already knows that QuantumScape is supposed to change the world with their solid state battery technology that should hopefully be developed by 2024. But QS aren't the only ones working towards this new technology. That brand new research and development plant, opening in Orlando, Florida, I mentioned earlier is being made to develop solid state for Microvast as well. That's right, QS isn’t the only company developing solid state.  An already established battery juggernaut going at it against a Silicon Valley startup for a revolutionary technology where the winner will take a large amount of the market. Microvast, who is staffed with Nobel prize winning chemists could be a real dark horse if they develop it first. 

USPS NGDV - 
One of Microvast’s largest customers to date is undoubtedly Oshkosh. Maybe you’ve heard of them if you were a Workhorse investor, because these are the guys who won the bid for the USPS Next Generation Delivery Vehicle contract. They're also one of Microvast’s PIPE investors, and Microvast is their electric vehicle battery supplier. Now this may be a bit speculative, but does it not make sense that Oshkosh would have their EV battery supplier supply the batteries for this new multi billion dollar EV contract? Could this be the reason the US Department of Energy requested Microvast to build a factory in Clarksville, Tennessee to meet the demand of such a large contract? If Microvast is the battery supplier for this contract, say hello to additional billions in contracted revenue. 
 

Full disclosure, I'm heavily invested in Microvast shares and have been adding 10 dollar calls every week for the last 3 weeks. I plan to hold this stock for the next 3-5 years as the world is on the brink of an EV industrial revolution and MVST has positioned itself as the pick and shovel to this goldrush. 

TLDR: Microvast should be worth more than Quantumscape and QS is currently worth 4 times Microvast",Microvast Vs QuantumScape,831,4

I believe the same will happen to Bumble. In fact, the story is already in motion. The app is rapidly gaining traction in India where it amassed four million out of a total of 31 million dating app users in the country as of mid-2020 (and double the user count from the end of 2019). The company is even partnering with Bollywood actresses to promote its app.

Overall, due to its high scalability, international expansion, reasonable valuation, and promising new ventures, Bumble is the kind of stock that can form a pillar of your portfolio. And I wouldn't be surprised if the company eclipses its rivals in the not-so-distant future.

Currently there is a massive Titanium Dioxide shortage that will raise the prices of Sunscreen massively. 


I was doing some research when I found something massive. There is not nearly enough Titanium Dioxide to meet global demand. Now I know from experience that Titanium Dioxide is Used in paint and Food coloring, both of which I consume daily. However it's also used in sunscreen and this is where I believe there is a huge option for price discovery. See Paint and Food coloring are manufactured in The U.S for the most part, meaning that supply chain shortages and a buildup of inventory over Covid don't make these products in short supply. However one thing we don't produce domestically on a large scale is sunscreen chemicals. These mostly come from India,China, Germany and the Netherlands. 

Why sunscreen manufacturers can make you Rich? 
1. Global shortage in sunscreen chemicals such as... Phenyl benzimidazole sulphonic acid, titanium dioxide, and avobenzone. 
2. Regulatory concerns over chemicals used such as Oxybenzone, Octylmethoxycinnamate, Cyclapentasiloxane,and a variety of Parebens (preservatives) 
3.  Global shipping slowdown 
4. Droughts that are making things across the U.S hotter then my wife's boyfriend. 
5. Climate is going through puberty
6. Solar flare crisis (insufficiently priced in) 
7. Apes are leaving their masturbation caves to like walk on the beach or some shit in record numbers, these same pasty ass apes are likely to buy sunscreen. 
8. Cosmetic and global sunscreen market is growing 
9. Skin cancer is on the rise. 
10. This year has been hotter then most years around the world. 
11. Recent consumer demand for sunscreen. 
12. Speculators will hoard sunscreen which will raise prices artificially. 

The above events in perfect combination could cause for a sky-high evaluation in both the sunscreen futures market and sunscreen manufacturers. Hell of the two penny stocks that you could buy to profit off of sunscreen manufacturing. One is already up 1000 percent this year. I believe this number could easily be 10000 percent based on the above hypothesis.

&amp;nbsp;


What’s poppin’ bull-gang, Flux here with an options exit strategy “guide”. I wanted to make this writeup because more often than not, I see people making fundamentally sound trades, only to have their gains vanish due to having poor exit strategy. They either get too greedy and hold on for way too long, or they exit way too early and miss out on an insane runup and want to die for a couple of days afterwards. There’s two parts to each trade - an entry and an exit - and if you’re caught skimping on either end, you’re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. Although this part of trading isn’t glamourous, it’s absolutely vital to your overall success as a trader, so it’s crucial that you learn and study these concepts sooner rather than later. With all that being said, let’s get into it.

&amp;nbsp;

#Types of Exits

There’s three types of exits that I tend to use when I conduct my trades, each useful in their own right. I’ll give a quick summary of them all, before providing an in depth analysis and examples of each.

&amp;nbsp;

- **Fundamental Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding the change of a company’s fundamentals. These exits usually take place before the fundamental changes since you’re not going to be able to react to the changes in real time and you’ll end up getting front run by algos. Examples of this include taking an exit during an earnings runup or rundown, taking exits before company related news events, or taking an exit before any market-wide news events.

&amp;nbsp;

- **Technical Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. Once I see a pattern or indicator pass a certain threshold, I know it’s likely time to exit my position. Some examples of technical exits may include exits taken around support and resistance levels, exits taken during gap fills, exits taken based off of technical patterns, and exits taken during the absence of any concrete patterns or indicators.

&amp;nbsp;

- **Psychologic Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding market psychology. This is the simplest of the three categories, and is often used in tandem with the other strategies to provide yourself with the best exit possible. Some strategies include exiting around whole numbers, screenshot theory, and individual gain theory. More on these later.

&amp;nbsp;

Obviously there are going to be a handful of strategies and categories which I’ve missed, but the ones I outlined above are likely going to be the ones which are most common to us retail traders.

&amp;nbsp;

#Fundamental Exits

**Fundamental exits revolve around one key idea - Sell the news.** More often than not, the results of a given news event are already baked into a stock's price well before the news event is confirmed or actually takes place. As a result, the price of a stock will almost always DROP even if this news is “confirmed”, because it was already priced in. This can be observed anywhere from earnings runups to product launches to fundamental news events. You may be wondering why this drop even happens in the first place - if the news is baked into a stock's price, shouldn’t it stay flat when the news is confirmed? Hint : Trading Algorithms.

&amp;nbsp;

Algorithms, or algos for short, are always behind the inevitable tanking of a stock's price post news event. It’s quite easy to see why once you understand how these algorithms work. An algo can read through an entire earnings report / news transcript / whatever and fire off a corresponding trade in a fraction of a nanosecond, meaning that they’re at a huge advantage since they **have the ability to sell the news after the news event hits.** This means that algos don’t have to prematurely exit their position until they confirm that the underlying security was priced properly. If the underlying was priced to perfection, the algo takes its profits once the news confirms it (very common behavior among algos - take profits once there are no longer any catalysts in play), thereby causing the stock to tank. If the instrument wasn’t priced properly, and there is a huge upside beat, the algo just stays in the trade and reaps the rewards, exiting at a later date instead. This concept is pretty difficult to wrap your head around initially, so let's go through an example.

&amp;nbsp;

**In our hypothetical example, let’s say $AAPL has just reported earnings.** 

&amp;nbsp;

**Scenario 1 : $AAPL is priced properly.** The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and confirms that $AAPL was indeed priced properly. The algo then takes its profits (as per common algo behavior), and dumps the position as a result of the priced in ER. Many other algos do the same as well, and the stock price “tanks”, resulting in a gap down the following day, and many left holding the bag, even on a seemingly good ER. Welcome to “priced in”.

&amp;nbsp;

**Scenario 2 : $AAPL is NOT priced properly.** The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and concludes that $AAPL was NOT priced properly. There was a huge upside beat. Instead of selling, the algo stays in the position because it knows that the underlying is undervalued based on the new news, and rides the wave up, exiting the position at a later date. $AAPL was not priced properly, and as a result, the news wasn’t priced in.

&amp;nbsp;

In both cases, the algos win - they either escape with their profits, or ride the wave up for even more gains. **Us humans cannot act as quickly as an algo, and thus we’ll always be at a disadvantage when it comes to fundamental exits. We always have to exit our positions prior to news catalysts to avoid getting front run.** News events are almost ALWAYS priced in. We can’t sell the news AFTER the news drops because we cant digest and react to the news fast enough. We can’t front run the algorithms, so we need to sell BEFORE any fundamental news catalysts, otherwise we run the risk of holding the bag. If there’s one thing I want you all to take away from this article, it's that you should **always sell the news.**

# Exiting Around Earnings

This is a very simple concept once we understand the mechanisms outlined above. If you’re in a trade, always look to close it out before earnings (unless you wanna get rug pulled, in which case go ahead, I'm not your daddy). If the news is priced in (which it probably is), you’ll get front run by algos and they’ll steal your profits. Do not gamble on the “priced-in“ news being wrong. You’ll lose that bet 9/10 times. Please note that even if earnings is a beat, that “beat” can still be priced in. Please, exit your trades before earnings, or you run the risk of getting blown out due to your own ignorance.

&amp;nbsp;

# Exiting Around Product Launches

This is similar to the concept we outlined above. In this hypothetical example, let’s say $AAPL announces that they’re going to reveal a new line of products in August. If that’s the case, get ready to exit your position before the event. Every August $AAPL showcases their new iPhones for the year, therefore even though they haven’t explicitly said they’re going to reveal iPhones, the market is gonna price the event as if iPhones are going to be revealed. Once they reveal that their new products are in fact iPhones, the price will tank, because it was priced in, and algos followed the exact behavior outlined earlier. The only instance in which the price wouldn’t tank would be if they announced that they’re releasing a teleportation device or something. Believe it or not, the odds of that happening are astronomically low, so you’re better off just selling before the reveal instead. Unless $AAPL comes out with something totally unexpected, the price will drop.

&amp;nbsp;

# Exiting Around Fundamental News Events

This pertains to market moving news as a whole, like an FOMC speech or some macroeconomic event. If you know that JPow is gonna speak on Wednesday, it’s probably best to exit your position before that since you’ve honestly got no idea what’s gonna happen as a byproduct of it. The entire market could take a shit or could fly green, nobody knows. Since we’re traders, not gamblers, it’s in our best interest to exit our positions or hedge in order to shield our gains. Fundamental news events are often crapshoots, and are the leading cause of solid gains getting unjustly erased in an instant.

#Technical Exits

Technical exits pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. In order to have the ability to do a technical exit, you must have a basic understanding of technical charts, patterns, and indicators. The entire field of technical analysis is easy to understand, but hard to master, so even if you don’t have much experience in the area, I’ll do my best to explain it all in a way which is friendly towards newer traders.

&amp;nbsp;

#Exiting Around Support and Resistance

This is often one of the easiest exits to perform, as it’s fairly straightforward to identify on a chart. **Whenever you start to approach an area which you’ve deemed as a key level of support or resistance, consider exiting your trade.** If the price has bounced off of that particular level five times in the past, it’ll likely hold true for the 6th time unless something has fundamentally changed about the company or the markets. As a result, you know that you should exit your trade as you approach the level, as it likely won’t keep going in the same direction once we get to that point. 

&amp;nbsp;

An awesome example of this would be the [$CLF chart.]( As we can tell, CLF trades in a nice ascending channel. In this case, we can use our trendlines to easily identify when to exit our trades in order to capture the maximum amount of our gains, saving us massive headaches. Once we get near any of the yellow trendlines, we should consider taking an exit since we’re likely going to bounce off of it. Another great example of similar price movement can be found in [$AMD’s chart.]( It trades off of supports and resistances very consistently, allowing us to bag consistent gains. However, unlike CLF, AMD often has breakouts to the upside or downside, making it trickier to trade in the event of a breakout.

&amp;nbsp;

You may be wondering if there’s any way you can capture the EXTRA gains in the event that the support or resistance levels don’t hold. Although I don’t recommend doing it too often, a well placed stop-loss can help protect your gains in the event that we reject off of a support or resistance, while simultaneously KEEPING you in the trade if we break through the support or resistance. Obviously, you’ll need some experience trading to know exactly where to place your stop, and it’s going to vary from ticker to ticker based on IV and the type of security or derivative you’re trading. A well placed stop-loss can help magnify your returns while also preventing you from giving up any gains you’ve already locked in. Be wary, too tight of a stop could take you out of a trade entirely before a run, but too loose of a stop could cause you to give up too much of your unrealized gains. It’s a fine line to play, and that only comes with experience.

&amp;nbsp;

Another way you could play breakouts is by using a two stepped approach. First, you take your exit once you approach a given level of support or resistance to lock in your gains. You then set an alert within your broker slightly higher than that given level. If your alert gets tripped, you know that there’s been a breakout, and you’re clear to re-enter the trade to then capture any extra gains that may occur once it starts to run. If I run this strategy, I make sure to set my stop under the newly broken support or resistance in order to preserve my capital in the event of a false breakout. In the end, this method is much safer, but it requires you to sit at your computer twiddling your thumbs waiting for a breakout, so I personally don’t prefer it.

&amp;nbsp;

# Exiting Around Gaps

Before we get into how to trade gaps, we need to understand what gaps are, and why they occur. [**Gaps are areas on a chart where the price of a stock moves sharply without any trades being placed.**]( Usually this happens as a result of a positive or negative catalyst affecting a stock outside of regular trading hours, resulting in a respective gap up or down the following day. A “gap” refers to a gap in the stock's price as a result of no trades being conducted within that range. Gaps are created because of low volume (technically no volume), and as a result, are prone to getting “filled” very quickly. Once we are within the price range of a gap, it’s very common that we will get sucked through the area with prices strongly trending towards the opposite side of the gap as a byproduct of the lack of volume.

&amp;nbsp;

When trading gaps, we need to recognize two important levels, and understand how price will act around them. **The very last trade that took place before the gap was created will be a very heavy level of resistance, and the very first trade that takes place after a gap will also be a very heavy level of resistance.** As a result, we will be very prone to rejecting off of these levels, so we want to fully exit our trade around these levels, no exceptions. Once we’re past the initial resistance, we can look to re-enter the trade to capture the rest of our profits.

&amp;nbsp;

Understanding all of that, gap trades are relatively simple. First, we ride our trade up to our first level of resistance (the beginning of the gap, aka the price that the first trade was conducted at), and then take our exit to lock in our profits. Afterwards, we set an alert slightly above the resistance, so we get notified once we’re past the resistance and are in the gap. Since we know there’s no trading volume within the gap, there’s a good chance we will get sucked through to the other side, meaning we should look to re-enter the trade as quickly as possible and then ride it to the opposite end of the gap (the end of the gap aka the price that the last trade was conducted at before the gap was created). Once we get to the opposite end of the gap, we fully exit the trade, because we know that 99% of the time we will reject off of this next heavy level of resistance. Gaps have a very rigid structure, and trade very similar to a breakout play. Enter a trade, exit at first resistance. Re-enter the trade after we break resistance, exit once we’re at the second resistance.

#Clear Skies and Falling Knives

A clear skies situation refers to when a stock is on a tear and has recently carved out new all time highs - think [$AMZN’s recent run to $3750,]( or [$CRSR’s initial run to $50.]( A falling knife is the flipside of that, and refers to when a stock is essentially in freefall - like $NKLA when people found out Trevor Milton is a rat, or $WKHS when they lost the government contracts. In both situations, it can be extremely difficult to know when you should exit your trade since we don’t have any technical levels to go off of, and as a result, we don’t know when to anticipate a bounce. Even if we did have a general idea of where it was going to bounce, the market often over reacts, resulting in us blowing past our initial mark before starting our initial recovery.

&amp;nbsp;

**The simplest way to play these situations is with a trailing stop.** Trailing stops were invented for situations like these, and they’re honestly one of the most effective yet under-utilized tools. Set the stop, and it’ll trail the stock as it moves. When a stock is carving out new highs, or plunging to new lows, a properly set trailing stop will let you get as close to maximum profits as possible while still allowing you to stay in the trade if we experience some turbulence along the way. If your trailing stop is set properly, you shouldn’t get stopped out of the trade from natural market movements, and will only be forced out once we’ve found a new high or low. I’m not going to teach you how to properly set trailing stops as that’s beyond the scope of this article, but it’s something I may write about in the future given that enough people are interested.

&amp;nbsp;

**Alternatively, if you want to abuse basic human psychology, you could also look to exit your position around whole numbers.** Humans are weird creatures, in the sense that we like “whole” things - stock prices are no exception. You better believe there’s going to be buyers or sellers setting up shop at nice, round numbers. Think $20, $50, $100, etc. If a stock is making a miracle run from $10, and is approaching $20, you better believe there’s going to be a large number of people looking to take profits at the $20 mark, and as a result, you should look to exit the position around there. Again, this isn’t a 100% concrete theory, and sometimes these levels won’t hold at all, but it’s still something to keep in mind. More on this later.

&amp;nbsp;

#Technical Caveats

**Please note, that these technical exits won’t hold true given that a company's underlying fundamentals have changed. A stock's technical charts and indicators are only to be used as a summary of a company's fundamentals.** Technicals summarize the price action which is driven by the underlying fundamentals. If the fundamentals of a company change, the technical indicators and charts will also change, thereby making our old technical charts void. This is an extremely important concept that most traders and investors do not fully understand. Technicals summarize fundamentals.

&amp;nbsp;

If $MSFT announces that they’re coming out with a time machine, don’t expect the stock's price to bounce off of the nearest overhead resistance, as that level is now void. $MSFT has fundamentally changed as a company, and as a result, the technicals will also need to change to reflect that. The same is true to the downside. If $MCD announces that they’ve been grinding up humans and putting them into their hamburgers, don’t expect the nearest level of support to hold - it’s void. The stock will plunge into free fall until $MCD is properly priced given it’s new fundamentals. Only then can we look to start re-establishing our technicals.

&amp;nbsp;

**Technicals are only to be used as a summary of a company’s current fundamentals.**

&amp;nbsp;

#Psychological Exits

Psychological exits consist of concepts and rules derived from how humans think and react to certain events. They are more conceptual in nature, and will vary from person to person. They aren’t necessarily as concrete as the other types of exits due to their ambiguous nature. Everyone will apply these exits differently, and as a result I can’t give you a consistent set of rules for each one. I can just explain the general concepts and provide different contexts regarding when to apply them. The rest is up to you!

&amp;nbsp;

#Screenshot Theory

This is a very simple concept that I actually adopted from Wall Street Bets of all places - **If it’s good enough to screenshot, it’s good enough to sell.** If you’re taking screenshots of your unrealized profits to flex on your friends, or random internet people, it’s probably time to sell out of that position. The only reason you feel the need to flex your gains is because it’s a life altering amount of money. I don’t care what the fundamentals, or technicals say at that point. Cash out of the casino, and realize those gains. If it’s good enough to screenshot, it’s good enough to sell.

&amp;nbsp;

# Individual Gain Theory

This concept refers to when you’re trading with money that you cannot afford to lose, and you come in on somewhat of a win. Profit or loss, this money is going to fundamentally alter your life (for better or worse) because you were put in a position where you had to “trade” money which you also needed elsewhere. If you’re ever in a situation where you’re forced to trade to make some extra dough, take those profits asap. A loss is often going to make your life a hell of a lot worse than a win will.

&amp;nbsp;

# Exiting Around Whole Numbers

Humans are weird creatures - we like “whole” or “round” stuff, numbers being no exception. How often do you catch yourself submitting a buy order for 20$, or a sell order for $50. Unless you’re cognizant of it, you’re not going to think to yourself “imma buy $CLF at 21.83”. There’s a good chance you’re gonna round it up to $22, or down to $20, etc. The same goes for literally EVERYONE else. Just keep in mind that depending on the direction you’re trading, there’s often going to be buyers / sellers at whole numbers. $10, $20, $25, $30, etc. No number is safe. Look to time your exits before or after these numbers, as they may prove to be mini points of resistance. You’ll often see sellers step in at whole numbers on the way up, and buyers step in at whole numbers on the way down. Use this to your advantage.

&amp;nbsp;

---

# Emotional Exits

This concept applies to two key emotions - Euphoria and Hope. **The instant you start feeling euphoric about a trade and it’s potential gains, step away from the trade.** You’re not going to be thinking clearly enough to make an optimal trade or exit. There’s a very high chance you’re going to continue to chase the victory. If the victory starts slipping away from you, you're likely going to stay in the trade hoping that it goes back up to the previous high that you didn’t sell at. In situations like this, by staying in the trade, you’ll almost always hold your position well past the top, and will be prone to “diamond hands-ing” your profits into the ground, ultimately coming up with a loss on a fundamentally sound trade. 

&amp;nbsp;

You need to be conscious of the fact that you’re euphoric, and that this trade went awesome, and exit the position intelligently. Once you start feeling euphoria, and consequently hope, there’s no going back. You’re not trading on fundamentals, and you’re not trading on technicals either. You’re simply not trading rationally. In situations like this, it’s best to take a step back and exit the trade before you make a boneheaded move and end up giving your gains away. Emotions cloud judgement, and as traders, that’s the last thing we want. Sell out of a position once you start feeling intense emotion.

&amp;nbsp;

#Conclusion

All in all, options trading is a difficult game with many moving parts - If you're caught skimping on your exits, you’re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. This aspect of trading is less glamorous and often overlooked, but is absolutely vital to your success as a trader.

Back again with another stupid stock to throw your life savings into, this will be an earnings play, and you know how those usually go...

anyways, I wanted to see how SNDL price performed leading up to the last few earnings reports. This data is raw... it's just the data. I didn't want to dig into the minutiae of the reasoning behind the movement, but more so just discover if there's been a definitive pattern. 4 of the last 5 reports made positive price runs from T-5 through the day of the report. The AVG daily down days (settle-to-settle) were -5.6% *(-20.8% MAX)* while the AVG daily up days were +20% *(+83.4% MAX)*. To take this a step further, the following day's high print vs. the previous day's settle was an AVG +25.6% *(+145.5% MAX)*. In summary, over the last 5 earnings reports, SNDL price net-rallied into the report 80% of the time, and those net-rallies were nearly 2X stronger on AVG than the lone time price was lower (*translation \~ longs risked $1 to make $2 and had a 4 in 5 chance of winning multiplied by whatever QTY they chose to do*). It was also encouraging to see AVG up days were 4X that of down days. If the last 5 reports are any indication of what we’ll see leading into 8/12, we should see significant upside price movement with limited downside risk.

&amp;#x200B;



# TL;DR 8/12 is a turning point for the volatility, which also happens to be the earnings report, which also happens to be the end of a HUGE cup and handle. I eat crayon, do you?

This is not financial advice, I am NOT your financial advisor.  


Edit: Here is my position

I wanted to see how people are feeling about the results. So my question for everyone is:

What is your prediction for earnings and do you consider it to be bullish, bearish or neutral?

I’ll go first. I’m bullish I think their revenue (9.89 million for Q1) will be very favorable in the $15 to $20 million area. I also expect the company to expect that number to further increase in Q3 and Q4 with revenue increases to the $22-$27 (Q3) and $27-$32 million ballpark in those quarters. I’m further expecting positive EBITDA. I’m expecting cash on hand at about $167 million and finally I’m not too sure how they will report it but a cash drawdown of about $550-$650 million. They also still have a negative $129 million in warrants that will be declared. 

They did gain 100 retail locations to nab highest market share in Canada and further vertically integrate, reducing costs. 

I expect operational costs per $ revenue to improve and a slight reduction in $ per gram sold at market (due to tighter market conditions in Canada). I doubt much will be said about expanding into the US if federal legislation occurs with the narrative being to improve and streamline their Canadian work and then purse a slow and calculated but strong entry into the US market (but only after federal legalization, which could be 2 years away).

I’m optimistic that we will get more information on their lending business and depending on how much money is deployed that work could produce another $5-10 million a quarter in revenue.

Finally I expect them to elaborate on the benefits and synergies of the inner spirit acquisition. The will be optimistic but largely on a subjective rather than objective level.

This will probably be reported as a significant net loss in large part due to investments in growth opportunities (vertical integration and diversification, which is kind of odd to see together because they appear contradictory, however I see it working in this case). The result is large and significant net loss with all the indicators pointing at growth and a bright long term future.

The net loss will probably be enough to send it red which is a great buying opportunity for the share price reversal that will happen at the much rosier looking Q3 &amp; Q4 reports and calls. Target a Q1 2022 market cap of 2 to 2.2 billion.

Also, they might hint at a reverse split to stay listed (but I doubt this will come up).

Ok that’s my uneducated layman’s prediction. If you trade based on this you are a truly retarded ape.

ZIP went public in late May via direct listing. Only existing shares were sold as the company is already profitable, and they had no need to raise additional cash or dilute ownership.

Since then the stock has had a floor of about $20, slowly rising to $27+ today, about a week before their first earnings call as a public company.

There have been 3 notable events that have had an effect on the stock in this time:

(1) A partnership with FB on 03August, which has pushed the stock up \~$1.50 (6%).

(2) Initiation of research coverage by a number of financial services companies. Mostly on 21June, which caused the stock to bump \~$2.25 (10.5%).

(3) A steady stream of conversion of reserve stock units to common stock and sales by early investors and executives.

The last of these increase supply of liquid stock in the marketplace and clearly puts downward pressure on ZIP. But…. the amounts you see being traded are not substantial on the scale of a \~$3B market cap. (Look for Form4 on SEC.gov for these sales) From the looks of it, it’s C-level execs cashing out \~$50-250k here and there. Nothing compared to the 85+ million shares sold (out of a fully diluted 123m) in the direct listing. (That and most of the high-ups seem to have the bulk of their stock locked up in family trusts.) Plus, I assume execs are kept from trading right now with their earnings announcement next week. Speaking of…

Unlike most tech companies going public these days, $ZIP is already quite profitable. By the looks of their S1, they took advantage of Covid to significantly reduce their cost structure and run a tighter ship (Operating expenses dipped from $381m (2019) to $300m (2020), over 20%. That while the money they’re making per employer (“Quarterly Paid Employers” in the S1) seeking employees via Zip went up 16% from \~$1100 to \~$1275. All in, the company ended 2020 with $86m in net income off of $418m in revenue.  ($64m of net income, ignoring a tax benefit.)

Their Form 424B4 shows that the March quarter continued this trend, turning an $11m loss (2020) into a $13m profit ($20m). Revenues increased 10+% quarter over quarter. They were $20m cash flow positive for the quarter, with $135m in cash on hand against a little over $25m in convertible notes, the only debt listed.

Last: The business. I like that this isn’t a sexy business. The company is profitable and well-capitalized, but what they do (online job marketplace) keeps them under the radar. And we’re at a place where employers are willing to pay out their ears to get warm bodies in seats. See recent headlines like: “Millions of jobs and a shortage of applicants” and “US job openings hit record 9.2 million but businesses can’t find enough workers to fill them.” Which means ZIP’s customers are going to have more listings (+) and willing to pay even more for each of them (++).

Well, Callaway is no longer *just* Callaway. The company has been snatching up valuable assets left and right and building itself into a diversified, cash-printing behemoth. Callaway now owns the Jack Wolfskin and Travis Matthew apparel brands, but most importantly, **mother fucking TopGolf** *(more on this in a bit).*

Last quarter, Callaway pulled in an EPS of 0.62 from its golf equipment and apparel business **ALONE**. This shattered analyst EPS estimates by over 400% and caused the stock to jump almost 20% in the following trading days.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here are just a few highlights from that** [**Q1 earnings report**](

* *Golf equipment continues to experience unprecedented demand and our supply chain was able to capture more of that demand than we projected • 29% revenue growth vs. 2020, +$85M*
* *Jack Wolfskin showed impressive resiliency despite European lockdowns, led by a 108% increase in e-commerce sales in Q1 2021 versus Q1 2020 and we feel increasingly confident in the future of this brand*
* *TravisMathew continues to impress and presents an even bigger opportunity than originally anticipated, led by a 145% increase in e-commerce sales in Q1 2021 versus Q1 2020 and a further strengthening across all channels*
* *US retail sales of golf equipment were up 72% compared to Q1 2020 and up 49% compared to Q1 2019,* ***the highest Q1 on record*** ***and the third consecutive quarter of record sales***\*.\*

&amp;#x200B;

Needless to say, guidance was great and these acquisitions were smart moves by Callaway’s team, but that all pales in comparison to Callaway’s newest addition - TopGolf.

In March of this year, Callaway committed highway robbery and finalized its acquisition of TopGolf for $2.6 billion in stock. I say highway robbery because prior to the pandemic, TopGolf had explored the idea of going public with numerous valuations north of **$4 billion**. After the pandemic hit, TopGolf took a nosedive and needed a quick exit strategy. Callaway swooped in and acquired them for pennies on the dollar.

&amp;#x200B;

If you've ever had the pleasure of visiting a TopGolf you'll understand why this acquisition was a brilliant move, but for the uninitiated here are some quick facts:

&amp;#x200B;

* *TopGolf generated revenues of 1.1 billion dollars in 2019 alone*
* *Pro forma revenue of approximately $2.8 billion based on fiscal year 2019 results that is expected to grow to approximately $3.2 billion by 2022 and at approximately 10% per year in the years following*
* *Pro forma adjusted EBITDAS of $270 million based on fiscal year 2019 results that is expected to grow to approximately $360 million by 2022 and at mid-to-high teens per year in the years following*
* *TopGolf has been growing at an annual Compound Growth Rate of roughly 30%*
* *Getting piss drunk with your friends and smashing balls into giant RGB rings is WAY too much fun*

&amp;#x200B;

Simply put, **TopGolf prints money and they're rapidly expanding.**

&gt;Globally, we have 66 company-owned venues in operation. For the full year (2021), we are on track to open at least three more venues, for a total of at least eight venues this year. We also remain confident in our pipeline for future venues.

&amp;#x200B;

**Callaway's Q2 earnings on August 9th will be** **their first earnings report to include TopGolf revenue** and [**average analyst EPS estimates are, I shit you not, 0.01**]( With golf exploding across the globe, Callaway’s record-breaking Q1 numbers/guidance, and the addition of TopGolf’s revenue, I see zero chance that $ELY doesn’t obliterate analyst expectations.

I could write another 5 paragraphs on $ELY's potential upside, but I understand that the average attention span here isn't great. This is not financial advice. This IS a suggestion to look into the play. Do your own research and happy trading, retards.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:**

Golf is booming worldwide, Callaway acquired TopGolf for an absolute steal, Q2 earnings call on 8/9 will be the first quarter they include TopGolf revenue. Analysts are fucking stupid.

Those that listened to me, grats. We made some serious tendies.

[Arbitrage Action](

Right now, I believe Arbitragers are being forced to close out their short positions with AMD due to liquidity risk.

I explain Arbitrage in more detail here: [

Basically, in this all-stock fixed ratio acquisition, the arbitrage play is to short AMD and buy Xilinx, then close positions when the deal is closed. However, they're not able to get to that point because AMD is up so much. Which means they have to close AMD short positions now and sell Xilinx to cover the costs. At least, that's what it seems is happening based on the charts. This is great for us AMD holders because it's driving the price higher. But I just wanted to impart some wrinkles on your smooth brain.

TLDR: The more AMD goes up, the more Arbitragers need to close out short positions, which causes AMD to keep going up. Which I listed as my best-case to-the-moon scenario in my Arbitrage Explanation post.

The ability to use individual wafers to produce higher end products give AMD the ability to increase silicon yield, improving revenue and margins. They have just released their first true MCM enterprise GPU in the instinct lineup, there is a massive GPU shortage worldwide due to supply Constraints, labor shortages, and the fact that higher end GPUs have absolutely horrendous silicon yields, I believe AMD is going to take the same ryzen approach to improving silicon yields in GPUs allowing them to not only create more supply of higher end GPUs, but also to be able to price them more competitively without diminishing their profit margins. This will take time as system integrators and engineers validate AMD's new components for the next 2 or so years. 


TLDR: AMD has MCM GPUs and both my hands and my dick are diamonds right now.

Edit: [My red and green croton drawings traditional GPU on left MCM on right](


Edit 2: How does this increase yield? 

Answer copy paste from my comment cause I'm lazy: 

Hypothetically if you were making chips, you start with one gigantic wafer of silicon, and you ""cut"" pieces of it off , these pieces are then analyzed and tested to see how much of the circuitry inside the wafer is usable, if the whole wafer is usable this will be used to create one high end sku,  if only half of it is usable then it might be used to make one mid range sku, and so on. This is the traditional monolithic way of doing things. Now with MCM design (multi chip module) let's say you need to fulfill inventory of a high end sku but you only have a bunch of pieces of silicon that can make mid range sku's, now all you have to do in an oversimplified nutshell is take 2 or 3 of those mid range wafers and connect them together, they'll act as one high end wafer. Which man's you didn't have to throw away silicon at a lower end and lower profit margin component.


Edit: the process I describe here is called chip binning and the way AMD bins their chips they have far greater flexibility to create higher end components using multiple mid end components. Generally speaking the highest end components are exempt from this process as it usually requires the full silicon wafer to be functional but this opens the door to drastically increase yields for everything beneath the highest end sku's.",AMD is going to revolutionize the GPU computing industry with their MCM designs.,146,2

**Time to strap on the propeller hat and stab a Capri Sun. We’re about to get retarded.**

You gotta love the parade of dogshit economists on CNBC that scream about the market being a house of cards. No shit buddy, I drop my pants to my ankles every time I piss and I knew that.  The truth is there are really only two forces that are deciding the fate of your net worth.

**Force 1**

The first is the deflationary pressure of exponential technology. We’re living in a world where huge industries are being rendered obsolete by rapid digitization, automation, artificial intelligence and the ability to mass produce certain goods quickly. Regardless of the company, the goal has always been to deliver more of a good/service with less resources. They have to operate like that to survive because we, as customers, are always voting. We are hardwired to vote with our money to get more for less price. The issue is that, in the process of streamlining their production, the amount of human labor needed becomes less and less. The products become cheaper and your utility as a laborer decreases since WALL-E can take your place. There’s a reason that wages haven’t increased for decades. You’re not just fighting for a job against your neighbor’s wife that joined the labor force in the 70’s, or a guy in India willing to do your job remotely. You’re now competing for a job against an artificial intelligence protocol who wasn’t programmed to give a shit about you or the box you sleep in. The supply of laborers is high and the demand for unskilled or even moderately skilled labor only decreases over time.

So technology is deflationary. Wages and easily reproducible goods must decrease in worth. Therefore, technology creates an ever expanding hole in the portion of Gross Domestic Product that human labor contributes to.

**Force 2**

The second force are Central Banks themselves. Their one and only objective is to fill this hole in GDP. JPOW himself wakes up in a cold sweat every night thinking about the financial Armageddon that would happen if he ever stopped quantitative easing or bumped up rates.

Every developed nation is more or less in the same boat. The goal is to devalue your fiat through inflation to counter the immense deflationary force of exponential tech innovation. If you let off the gas for even a moment, a deflationary hell will ensue that will dwarf the Housing Crisis. The debt bubble is astronomical and everyone knows that these debts can never be paid. But since most of the debt is denominated in US Dollars, the US Federal Reserve has a moral obligation to let it run so damn hot that JPOW wears oven mitts to work. This devaluation of the dollar through inflation is really just a hidden tax that attempts to spread the burden equally. But it doesn’t. The devaluation of the denominator (dollar) will only drive up the prices of scarce assets, further concentrating the wealth into the hands of asset holders alone. The poor are left working for pitiful wages that they stuff into a 0.5% savings account while the buying power of their cash will be almost cut in half every 3 years.

**How They Lie**

The Fed has been publishing fake inflation numbers since the Housing Crisis by using “The Substitution Method” to calculate the Consumer Price Index. In other words, they compare last year’s steak price to this year’s tofu price instead of comparing it to the steak price you’d see at the grocery store today. Then they can put on their best poker face and call a press conference to say, “Well shit, inflation must be stupid low since these two goods could be considered comparable.” In other words, the current global financial standard is the deck of the Titanic and even the glue eaters on CNBC can hear that sad string quartet playing their last songs.

**How to Save Yourself**

The first thing to remember is that Central Banks have no choice. They are fighting a war to keep 401k’s from imploding and the only weapons they have at their disposal will always funnel wealth to those that already have scarce assets. Unless you have those assets already, you’re playing a losing game. But there are ways to position yourself to save the net worth of yourself and your family.

**Option 1: Invest in Exponential Technology.**

If you can’t beat them, join them. Let the AI, the robots and automation be on your side. Do your homework and invest in tickers that have exponential technology working to accumulate wealth for them. If tech’s job has always been to deliver more for less, than all long term investing *is* tech investing (unless you subscribe to Buffet’s dusty old cigar butt approach). A good place to start would be by reading the balance sheets of the tickers in Cathie Wood’s portfolio.

**Option 2: Abandon the Current Financial System and Adopt the New One**

Say what you want about the forbidden B-word, but it is secure and scarce. It is a life raft. There’s a reason that the whole ecosystem's number of users is growing by 112% year over year, outpacing the adoption of the internet by almost double. B-word seeks to be a store of value, a perfect digital gold. There will never be confusion about who owns what (like there was during the Housing Crisis). Other well-known protocols are currently duking it out to become the world’s next financial derivative layer, which would aim to disrupt the almost 1 quadrillion derivate layer we currently have. Some of these are even becoming deflationary and will offer you yield in exchange for contributing to the security of the network. They are not without their risks though so do your homework.

**Option 3: Take Advantage of Cheap Credit and Accumulate Scarce Assets or at least Difficult-to-Reproduce Assets**

To my knowledge, no one has figured out how to effectively mass produce a decent single family home. Real estate is a great example of those scarce assets that must be pumped. There’s a reason why Blackrock has been accumulating real estate through REITs. They see the writing on the wall and they don’t really give a shit that you probably can’t outbid them or afford the future rent. They are just a rational actor thinking about how they can conserve capital. Whether it’s on a sovereign level, company level or individual level, we are all playing the same game and trying to accumulate scarcity.

**Good luck, my brothers**

**TLDR:** Technology is an unstoppable deflationary force. JPOW’s only weapon is to devalue fiat to prevent the debt Armageddon. Owners of scarce assets become wealthier and you get robbed of buying power.

Every cloud company out there worth its salt has reported great earnings so far. FSLY has been sold off for last 4 quarters post earnings primarily due to concerns regarding its largest customer being banned in US, which is not the case now. FSLY hired a new CFO, who was earlier the CFO of Fitbit fueling acquisition rumors**

**Company Summary**
Fastly is a content-delivery network (CDN). Its customers include Spotify, NY Times, Shopify etc. It is positioned strongely in streaming, e-commerce, and online gaming.

**Catalysts**
- Earnings after hours today - August 4

- Potential acquisition - Appointment of Ronald Kisling as CFO, who was most recently CFO of Fitbit, which was acquired by Google.

- Potential earnings beat and increase in Guidance - FSLY recently acquired a cloud security company - Signal Sciences. This might be key for increased guidance and earnings beat as this product allows developers to protect their apps in every environment including cloud / onsite and edge.

**Why it is 10x Bagger**
- Short float is 22.25% and short ratio 6.26, that means at current volume it will take over 6 days for shorts to cover. Any increase in guidance and a healthy beat on earnings will rocket this stock to mars.
- A very small chance of acquisition announcement in earnings call

**Why it may flop again**
- Its revenue is concentrated. Top 10 clients account for 29% of sales revenue. So, if any one of them fails, it materially affects FSLY. Good thing is, in 2017, the top 10 client's revenue accounted for 37% and now it has decreased to 29%.

- Its main competitor is Cloudflare which offers everything that FSLY offers, and both are competing for the same sales share from legacy operators like Akamai etc. Though Cloudflare ($NET) product is more focused toward small and medium size businesses, whereas FSLY deals with big enterprises.

**What does analysts say**

- 12-month target - $52

- Buys - 2 | Holds - 7 | Sells - 2


**Play**
The stock is currently trading near its all-time low, current price is $46 and 52 week low - $40. $136 is all time high.

- Since it's a binary and very risky play, its best to do a strangle, that is buy a call and put together on same strike or very close strike, near the money, considering the move is highly likely going to be over 10%, it will very much cover the cost of strangle.

- You can also buy shares and hedge it with a near the money long puts for same week or next week.

- And if you are feeling frisky, you can yolo $50 strike calls for Aug 6 | Aug 13 or Aug 20


**My Position**
- $49 Calls(200) for August 6 

- 20,000 shares

- $45 Puts(200) for August 13


**Tracker**
As I am looking to do regular short and crisp DD's on /wsb for the stocks which I am playing myself, I will track my performance with each DD. My last DD is here:

This has done very well; stock has already gone up over 15% since the time of DD and thesis that I put in the dd unrolled exactly like that.

So the discount (30% to ipo price) is taxed as income gain on the difference from the $26.60 and the $38. They then get to call $38 (the ipo price their tax cost basis). The irs believes this is 30% interest on the 3.5 bil loan. Interest is income profit, so pay income tax! And it is, these shareholders got a 30% bonus of stock for lending vlad the survival money. In short: the bailout shareholders owe the IRS!

A slang term for one of these bonds is 'death spiral convertible' The SEC actually has a whole page warning investors to be careful investing in companies who issue these. Thats why HOOD had to kill this horrible loan and hand over 140 mil shares to clear this disastrous and embarrassing mobster like loan off the books, to cleanse them for the ipo.

47 mil of the shares become sellable as soon as HOOD files a form S-1 with the SEC which is planned to happen within 30 days of the ipo. Another 47 mil become sellable 28 days later. 10 mil more employee shares 91 days after ipo, and the rest of the 50 mil shares from the bailout loan 126 days after ipo.

There share sales coming are huge, and they are driven by the investors who bailed out HOOD back in feb and had no choice but to dump another $3.5 billion in or watch their beloved boy from bulgaria go tits up. This wasn't real secure long term investment money.

The mobster terms they demanded deems some of the stock (30% of the 140 mil shares) a taxable loan interest income. They have to sell the shares to pay it by year end, or risk owing taxes and not having enough money to pay.

TLDR; Starting in a few weeks there will be tens of millions of shares coming off lock up from now to year end, and the owners have tax and lets get the flute outa here motivations to sell. You know what to do.

Me? I don't like the stock!

After two-months of consolidation, it now looks poised to resume its uptrend. (I did not take a Brazil position in May but I am positioned accordingly now with my analysis)

It has been 8 trading days since the back-to-back 80% upside volume days and the SPX is up about in-line with the historical average. Many key earnings reports as well as the FOMC meeting are now behind us. The SPX continues to be in a bull market and has evaded even a 5% pullback since last November, yet under the surface it has been anything but smooth. There have been many rolling corrections including the latest from China (KWEB down 55% from Feb. highs). So, while there is ongoing potential for some dishes to be broken in the kitchen, there are still plenty of long set-ups that are actionable here and if we get a resurgence from small and mid-caps, then many of the breadth divergences should be resolved.

Mid-Caps Nearing Key Breakout: While the battle between small-caps and large-caps rages on, mid-caps often are forgotten but do look poised as the next group to breakout after three months of consolidation.

o Discretionary Buys: BJ, DAR, LAD, YETI

o Technology Buys: CACI, CGNX, LSCC, XRX

o Industrials Buys: FCN, NDSN, RBC, TTEK

o Financials Buys: COR, FAF

The Russell 3,000, which represents 98% of U.S. equities, is less than 0.40% below its all-time high, yet only 39% of components are above their 50 DMA. This divergence is nothing new, but has gotten more extreme since June. I suspect that a breakout in small and mid-caps will cause a bit of a breadth surge, but this shows the ‘Muddy Waters’ action below the surface.

Aside from mega-cap (FAAMG) earnings and the FOMC, the plunge in Chinese stocks was probably the biggest story this past week. Given the sentiment, price and volume action, it does look capitulatory but there is going to be a lot of overhead supply in the 60-65 range for KWEB.

After significantly outperforming from last September, small-caps underperformed the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) by roughly 20% since mid-March. This looks like a logical spot to begin showing some relative strength.","Short Term Market Outlook and potential buys as of August 4, 2021",15,7

The question is: how much more can it go? Well, I put together some quick numbers and it seems it is still very cheap. I focused on Market Cap / Turnover, which is a ratio that I personally like a lot.

	NVDA

|Year|Turnover|Growth|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2018|11,716||
|2019|10,918|\-6.8%|
|2020|16,675|52.7%|

|2018-Today||64.36%|
|Market Cap|492B||
|MC / TO|25.6||

	

AMD

|2019|6,731|3.9%|
|2020|9,763|45%|

|2018-Today||106%|
|Market Cap|132B||
|MC / TO|9.9||

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see above, MC/TO ratio on NVDIA is almost 3x higher than on AMD despite AMD having higher recent growth. It is obvious that this is not the only ratio that matters and other factors come into play when pricing a stock, but AMD is an incredible growth stock and I strongly believe it will keep crushing on Turnover and closing the MC/TO gap to NVDA. Even a small increase from 9.9 to 12 would mean an additional 20% in stock price assuming current Turnover, which will be history very soon given the rapid growth.

Finally, it is important to note that NVDA is up 45% in the past 6 months vs 28% for AMD and this is mostly due to the XLNX acquisition, which brought concerns to investors. Recent numbers from XLNX have given some comfort to the market.

# Summary

Very simple negative EV trade, these don't come up often and are hard to find, but [historically have been consistently lucrative]( especially in a name as liquid as $EDU traded on the NASDAQ:

* Price: $2.00 (8/3/21 morning)
* Shares out: 1.7b
* Cash + Equiv: $6b
* Gross Debt: $2b
* Negligible minority interest and prefs

**That's $3.4b market cap and $4b in net cash = -$600m EV**

**Positions:**

* 10,000 shares EDU
* 80 EDU call options (WSB doesn't let you say which exact contract but \~4,000 total delta)
* 5,000 shares HKG:9901 (same company but HK listing)

# Thesis

Obviously mispriced asset. Say what you will about China stonks, Chinese education stonks, VIEs, yadda yadda that's all irrelevant: cash is cash. You're paying $3.4b for a $4b net cash shell on the balance sheet, regardless of what the company actually does. That doesn't make sense because it doesn't. In my 5+ years I've only personally stumbled upon 2 cases like this: $EVE.LN and $LK (yup, that LK). Literally any ""not absolute shitstorm"" news would make this pop WAY more than just the $4b of net cash on the balance sheet, which is available to you at $3.4b for no reason other than people are selling into shit-tier China sentiment they read on Twitter without ever taking an Accounting 101 class (see comments for this unfolding live).

So let's see what is behind the EDU covers, and learn from what happened to both LK and EVE when they went into negative EV land.

# $EDU situation

Fundamentals don't really matter for this trade (it's just a mispricing trade), but anyway: New Oriental Education (EDU) is a Chinese company that has 7 business lines, the largest of which (75% of their $4b revenue) is private tutoring. Unless you live under a rock you'd know for-profit private tutoring has recently been banned in China because of several reasons (won't go into detail but mostly around cost of education, ethics, widening wealth gap, low birth rate).

None of the above is really that important. Here's what important:

1. **87% of EDU ownership is institutional, and most of that is US institutions.**This is important because common shareholders are less likely to get completely screwed because of poor geo-political optics. EDU isn't the only Chinese edu co getting railed right now and this shareholder structure is not uncommon for VIEs and ADRs. Despite what American news tells you, American and Chinese LPs are both balls deep in each other and both care oh so very much about optics, particularly in high finance, so it's unlikely common equity gets TOTALLY screwed over.
2. **25% of EDU's $4b of revenue is still legal.**Keep in mind tutoring is only 75% of EDU's $4b run rate revenue that's been outlawed, the other 25% (language, admissions consulting, school tours etc.) is still perfectly legal meaning you have a company that can make $1b revenue trading at negative EV...
3. **EDU has a TON of residual assets.**69k employees, 10.6m student enrollments, 118 schools, 1,625 learning centers, 11 bookstores. They could start a god damn Nike factory or the biggest car wash on Earth tomorrow with assets like that. Point is, whatever this $4b cash shell becomes, it's not worth -$600m, or even remotely close to $0 for that matter.

So it's clear that EDU is not worth $0, much less negative $600m. What can happen from here on? [Here's the only study from the CFA Institute (albeit from 2013) I could find on negative EV trading performance](

&gt;**The average 1-year return of 2,613 negative EV opportunities over 40 years was 50.4%.**

Looking good so far. But let's look to 2 recent examples I've traded through first hand for guidance:

# $LK (up 15x from negative EV)

Now trading OTC as $LKNCY. This is the best comparable out there imo: Luckin Coffee, a Chinese fraud that got exposed, got sold to negative EV at a low of $0.95 in May 2020, traded up to high of $15.65 (up 17x) and today on 8/3/2021 trades at $14 (up 15x in 15 months).

Compare to EDU: a perfectly non-fraudulent Chinese co that got its main business regulated away, leaving a ton of residual assets and the ability to generate $1b of legal revenue, also in negative EV land.

# $EVE.LN (up 6x from negative EV)

Eve Sleep. British mattress shitco trading on the AIM, the single worst exchange in the universe. Traded to lows of 1.15 GBP in May 2020 due to COVID and grazed negative EV land. It then promptly re-rated to 6 GBP (up 5x) by September 2020 and peaked at 7 GBP (up 6x) in February 2021. Still trading at 3.30 GBP today.

Compare to EDU: NASDAQ listed with 70m average daily volume, also in negative EV land.

# The $EDU trade

So what can happen to EDU? As exhaustively as I can brainstorm, I think the possible scenarios are

1. Pivot to another biz with the same assets
2. Spin off the tutoring biz
3. Go private via buyout/merger
4. De-list to OTC

The most logical valuation for all of these would be based off the remaining $1b of legal revenue, which should yield at the very very VERY least a billion or two or EV, which is \~$3.50 per share. Again, at the VERY LEAST. Which is at least 50-60% upside from here with honestly, without sounding facetious, negligible downside risk--the cash on the balance sheet is literally worth more than what $EDU is trading at.

If you use LK and EVE as precedents then you're looking at 14x and 5x within a year. And if you use  linked study from the CFA Institute, negative EV trades average 50% return within one year.

# Conclusion

It's a cash shell worth $4b trading at $3.4b. Doesn't matter what you think of China or what the CCP will do, it's mispriced.

DYODD.

In a single given day you could have almost 30 times more gain post than loss post. This obviously doesn’t make much sense because I would almost guarantee that there are more people losing than gaining this sub alone. I don’t usually post gains or losses in the sub Reddit because usually they don’t really matter. You can make 100% gain or lose 90% but if it’s just simple trade it it’s not really interesting to post. Right like if you gain with Apple options than well yeah it’s a gain but it’s not interesting to post really. 

But the reason why I think this is a problem is because people especially new traders have this false sense of always making money. And I don’t know why the The lost porn became so dried because throughout the history of the sub posting your loss was basically an assured popularity and respect because not only did you make a bad trade but you were willing to share that with everybody else. Imagine if  analfarmer2 only ever posted when his spy plays made money. Or how deepfuckingvalues was posting his position a year ago when it was down 50%. 

To me it kind of feels like a lie and also kind of pussy behavior. If you are an investor and you will post literally any single gain you have ever made in your entire life conveniently scrub away all the losses—kind of makes it seem like you just want people to think you are good at reading right and you being good at trade. 

I don’t wanna call out the mods or or even demand a change and I don’t even know how popular the sentiment is in the sub right now because I know there are about 2 million people That actually remembered What does sub was like before gamestop. 

#My simple solution is to have a requirement that every gain post, or even every loss post, must include a second picture at least that shows the entire account to date chart. So if you post a gain from a trade, at least a second picture of your main chart with “all” showing how much you started with and how much you have now. 

I think it’ll show a better picture of how these traders are actually doing rather than simple gain trades overwhelming every single day.

It's got a ROIC of 18%. ROIC is a complicated number I don't understand but over 15% is supposed to be good.

It's near a 52 week low, and every time it has dropped to it's current level of $160 it rebounds, which is scientific proof it will totally do it again.

And most importantly, TTWO is Rockstar's publisher, and I am convinced that GTA 6 is in development and Rockstar is just keeping it secret.

Reasoning:

* GTA is an absolute cash cow, so there's no way they won't continue the franchise, but GTA Online makes enough money they don't have to rush
* It's not a good idea to release a next gen AAA game right now cause no one can find a PS4 or Series X due to chip shortage
* Keeping it secret helps avoid a Cyperpunk 2077 style hype train disaster and prevents forcing devs to crunch to meet announced deadlines
* Therefor, an official announcement is probably still a ways off, maybe even years

How do institutions alone own more than 100% of all available shares of a stock? What about retail, how much do they own? It has to be unreported institutional short-selling, doesn't it?

Also quick looked up Zillow's Class A Stock, ZG.

[Nasdaq says]( institutions own 90.77% of ZG - with [CNN Business]( reporting the same.

While that's not over 100%, \~91% ownership still seems like a pretty high number. Anyone have ideas as to what's going on here?

For context, AMD announced Xilinx acquisition in october last year: [

The acquisition is an all-stock deal, which means for every Xilinx stock you will get exactly 1.7234 of AMD stock after the merger is completed. The merger is planned to be completed by the end of the year, and it has been reiterated during 2 of the previous earning calls.

&amp;#x200B;

# What is there to gain?

AMD stock is trading today at $112. Xilinx today is trading at $146. This means a ratio of 1.30 instead of 1.7234. Buying Xilinx you are buying AMD stocks for $85 after merger happens. This is 30% upside of free monies.

&amp;#x200B;

# What is there to lose?

If AMD/XILINX deal doesn't go through, XLNX will most likely jump straight back to pre-merger announcement territory, it will probably end up around $110-$115.

&amp;#x200B;

# What could stop the merger from happening?

There are several regulators that have to approve merger. Most of the important ones already did:

[

However it hasn't been approved by China yet: [

The moment China approves the deal, Xilinx stock will jump very close to 1.7234 multiple of AMD (and possibly drag AMD down a bit, however merger approval is *good news* for AMD as well).

&amp;#x200B;

# What are the chances China does not approve of the deal?

Of course it's a gamble with high US-China tensions, but let's take a look at some facts. In 2019 Chinese antitrust committee reviewed 465 deals. It approved all of them (!!).

[

In 2020 they reviewed 458 deals. Out of all of them, they rejected a single one (DouYu merger with Huya, both Chinese companies).

[

This means only one rejection out of 923 deals!

Nvidia purchased Mellanox in 2020 and it was conditionally approved through China. This is equivalent of AMD/XLNX deal. AMD owns ATI, which was started by Chinese Canadians. Both Xilinx and AMD are US based. They already have heavy business connections with China. I'm not bold enough to estimate the odds, but the facts suggest they're quite high!

&amp;#x200B;

# If this is such a good deal, why is nobody else buying XLNX?

They were, but had to cover their shorts! The most common way to play XLNX/AMD merger is to go short AMD and long XLNX, and that's what most investors did. However, with recent magnificient AMD run up after Q2 earnings call they were forced to cover their short positions as they became too expensive to hold till the merger. And I have proof that prices were closely correlated until very recently, let's take a look at this XLNX/AMD ratio graph: [

Up until very recently the deal was oscilating within 1.5-1.6 area and after recent AMD run up it's been lagging strongly behind. Unless there's some hidden factor major investors know about but not common folks, this is literally the best time in history to buy XLNX to convert into AMD after the merger.

In May, Discovery announced a deal to merge with AT&amp;T’s Warner Media business – their goal is to create a streaming powerhouse to compete with Disney and Netflix. The new business will be called ‘Warner Bros. Discovery’ and the deal is expected to close mid 2022.

Both businesses saw growth in streaming subscriptions this quarter. Warner Media has 67.5m subs (growth of 6% Q-o-Q) and Discovery has 17m subs (growth of 30% Q-o-Q). That’s a total of 85m subs, with quarterly growth of 8%. I think the combined entity will see further subscription growth, as the value proposition of the combined entity will be far more compelling. I don’t need to tell you how the market will reward such growth (just look at the valuations of Netflix and Disney)

**The Smoothbrain Play**

Warner Bros. Discovery is forecasting FY23 EBITDA of $14b and Free Cash Flow of $8.4b. Discovery stockholders will receive 29% of the combined entity. Discovery’s stock (DISCK) closed at $26.50 last night, giving Discovery a market cap of $13b (there are 3 classes of Discovery stock, but they all rank equal in the merger, so I’m doing my maths on the cheapest class which is DISCK). 

At a $13b valuation for Discovery (which is 29% of the merged entity), ‘Warner Bros. Discovery’ therefore has a market cap of only $45b. At a market cap of $45b, you’re buying in at a multiple of only 3.2x for FY23 EBITDA and 5.3x for FY23 Free Cash Flow, which is an absolute bargain. In comparison, Netflix trades on a 13x EBITDA multiple. If ‘Warner Bros. Discovery’ were to also trade at a 13x EBITDA multiple, then a DISCK stock would be worth $106

This is not investment advice. I own Tilray shares myself with an average entry price of $14.97.

I would like to outline some bull &amp; bear scenarios regarding the company below, along with a general assessment and reasons why Tilray is a good stock with further growth potential.

**II. Numbers (mostly) do not lie**

First of all, I always look at the numbers when it comes to stocks, because I like to buy a solid stock for my money, apart from a few exceptions. The problem with a value approach is that stocks never trade ""cheap"" without a reason. The negatives are priced in, so in 99.9% of cases there is no such thing as a ""cheap"" company. Everything is fairly valued. Therefore, the figures can only give information about the value, if you do not look at them isolated. However, it is mandatory to know them.

Regarding Tilray, it is known that the quarterly numbers far exceeded expectations. Earnings per share were $0.18, well above the forecast.

But here's the first point: Tilray's EPS was -$0.09 for August 2020, -$0.37 for November 2020, and -$0.97 in February 2021. It was only after the merger with Aphria that Tilray was able to report in the black. So the question to be answered is whether Aphria helped to switch to profit. Here, in any case, a clear \`no' applies with regard to EPS. Aphria had an EPS of -$1.14 in the last figures before the merger. The quarters before that were better with -$0.42 and -$0.02, but also not positive.

So based on EPS alone, it cannot be said that the positive result is due to the merger with Aphria.

Other Key Figures (Based on Tilray's Interim Unaudited Financial Statement for the Year ended May 31, 2021): Tilray currently has positive free cash flow at $3.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA would be $40.7 million for the year based on quarterly numbers, still positive since 2020. Revenue would be $513 million. This is all nice, but only suggests a relatively favorable price-to-sales ratio of about 12. The recently announced quarterly numbers alone only say that the black numbers (at least) are not coming solely from the merger with Aphria. This is the first time the company has presented such numbers, so little can be inferred from them going forward, except for hope and some positive indicators.

**III. Opportunities**

**1. Tilray's position in the market**

Tilray has become the largest cannabis producer in the world after its merger with Aphria. However, this does not mean that Tilray produces and distributes cannabis in raw form, rather Tilray has several product ranges that now serve almost the entire market. Not only medical cannabis, but also others such as craft beer or products not directly associated with the typical scope of cannabis.

The market in which Tilray is currently the best positioned player is tiny compared to the market of alcohol or other raw materials for which cannabis would also be suitable (be it medical applications or textiles and food). Cannabis is explicitly permitted for consumption in two countries. For medical use, however, it is already approved in 47 countries.

**2. Regulations as the main criteria for development**

The market that can open up here is worth tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars. Should regulations loosen, Tilray, as the largest producer, is well positioned to serve this market. With its market cap of $6.2 billion, Tilray is valued at just enough to be quickly caught up by revenues if not profits in the coming years, assuming regulations continue in the current direction.

But that is also the most important keyword: regulations. If country approvals change or do not continue to develop as they have in the past, Tilray's hands are tied. There is no way to bypass them and move into other markets.

**3. Other risks**

* Competition with the black market

Tilray is a legal company and accordingly must comply with applicable law. However, it is in direct competition with one of the largest black markets in the world, at least for one of its products. For this competitor, no laws and regulations apply, which means that Tilray has a higher price tag on its products.

However, this point can easily be refuted by the fact that the price for the control and security that go hand in hand with it are out of proportion to the price premium. One would think so. But here the opinions are divided, what influence a legalization has on the black market. After some research, one could only read in not particularly named sources that the black market has become larger after legalization. But it is clear that it does not disappear. Bloomberg Canada, for example, [states that the illegal market has shrunk significantly since legalization]( Opinions differ, however, as to [what role taxes play in this]( and [under what circumstances people would still use the black market](

&amp;#x200B;

* Competition on the legal market

Cannabis is not subject to a patent. Other producers can serve the market just like Tilray, that can be especially Cannopy Growth, which is positioned not far behind Tilray in the market.

However, if the bet on regulators works out, the market will be so enlarged that even if four big players were to serve the market, it would still far exceed the current market cap of all cannabis companies.

&amp;#x200B;

* The Cannabis Market is New

The cannabis market has only really started to pick up steam since 2016, and can develop quickly accordingly. This can be a risk factor for Tilray's business plan if it cannot be flexibly adjusted. But again, it should be noted that Tilray is theoretically best positioned as the largest player in the market and even if the cannabis market can evolve, the product is relatively consistent.

The only problem is the price pressure in the new market. If the market grows, it is clear that prices will drop. That will have an impact on sales and profitability. In my opinion, this is the only negative argument that is really valid. Here we can only hope that similar profitability will result as with alcohol or other consumer goods stocks, and that ultimately Tilray will come out on top here due to sheer size. Tilray is thus more likely to dominate the market, as their capacity means that they in fact also have lower losses than smaller companies.

**4. Conclusion**

Should the cannabis market open up a larger portion or possibly its full potential after loosened regulations, Tilray will be right up front. While there are a few risk factors to consider. Ultimately, though, it comes down to two things. For the short-term investors: can Tilray continue to deliver such strong numbers over the next few quarters. For the long-term investors: How will it fare with regulations around cannabis? If these are loosened, Tilray is certainly the right address to participate in the then emerging market.

**Virtu Financial DD:** 

Virtu Financial **(VIRT)** is a publicly traded Market-Making (MM) firm. Yes, I know owning a market making firm seems like a risky idea; however, I am about to lay out the **Bull Case** for owning this company. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Bull Case:**

**LongTerm Thesis:**

In order to start the Bull case I want to discuss a well known company that recently IPO’d… You may have guess it, this company is Robinhood **(HOOD)**. Robinhood is a brokerage that makes its money buy selling its customers orderflow. Who is buying this order flow? You guessed it, MM firms! In the last quarter we can see that Virtu Financial made $575M from their Market Making business, that is after the payment for order flow! 

  

[MM Net Income](

To see the breakdown we can look at the next table. 

&amp;#x200B;

[MM Income Breakdown](

Virtu generated $801M in MM revenue and paid only $223M for the order-flow to the brokerages, ex. Robinhood. This is a **gross margin** of **72.2%** on the MM business. That means for every $1 VIRT pays to a brokerage, they are able to make $3.59, or $2.59 in profits! Not to mention this profitability scales as Robinhood and other brokerages grow meanwhile, VIRT doesn’t have to pay a penny for the customer acquisition costs! 

This is one reason why Virtu had a revenue of $1,073M last quarter, HOOD only had a revenue of $522M. While Virtu has 2x HOOD’s revenue, has a more profitable business, and has less expense to grow revenue/customer base, HOOD’s MC is \~$38B to VIRT’s \~$5B. 

Virtu’s P/E is always fluctuating as market volume is the key indicator to VIRT’s revenue but I believe we have entered a new market trend where active management is here to stay. New traders and investors are obsessed with the markets and love to buy and sell positions with a much shorter holding period than historically. This may be due to the gamification of trading apps, or a plethora of other reasons but all that matters is the trend of average volume increasing across the broader market. 

Jumping back, you may have noticed the spotty revenue figures seen in Q3 and Q4 2020, why is this? Well Q1 and Q2 of 2020 had very high volumes due to the Covid-19 crash and following rebound. This is another great reason to own the stock, let me explain. VIRT literally makes way more money when the market crashes because volumes spike during the panic. That means VIRT is not correlated to the overall market and actually has a %-year Beta of -0.29.

&amp;#x200B;

[5-year Beta](

When the market crashes, VIRT benefits therefore the shares can be sold, and used to buy other companies at very cheap valuations! 

**Short Term Thesis:**

During Q1 2021 meme-stocks were all over the news. Gamestop made incels and plebs into multi-millionaires which drew in mass amounts of volume into the markets chasing similar returns. Due to this unexpected volume VIRT EPS beat by 63% (Actual: $2.04 vs Expected: $1.25). This meme-stock craze has continued in Q2 2020 with AMC, CLOV, BB, SPCE, just to name a few. (Just pull up the charts and look at June volumes, too many charts to attach) 

Personally, I expect EPS to be below Q1 as total market volumes decreased by approx 25%  Q2 2021 than Q1 2021, as seen below. 

&amp;#x200B;

[2021 Q2 Market Volume](

&amp;#x200B;

However, I still believe VIRT will easily beat the expected EPS of $0.81. 

**Q2 2021 earnings call is Before Market Open tomorrow Aug 4th, 2021.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Share Repurchases:**

Virtu Financial has been aggressively buying back shares as they are currently trading at a ttm P/E of 4.91. (Not using Forward P/E cause earnings estimates have been proven to be inaccurate) Virtu started repurchasing shares in Q4 2020 purchasing 1.4M shares (0.7% of float), 2.3M shares in Q1 2021 (1.2% of float), and 1.6M shares in first 2-months of Q2 2021 (0.8% of float). 

Since the last earnings on May 4th, 2021 the share price traded from \~$28/share upto $32/share and has recently fallen to $25/share allowing for buyback to continue at these low levels.

&amp;#x200B;

**Technicals:**

1. Daily RSI is currently at 37.
2. MACD has reversed and is forming a bullish pattern.
3. Share price is pushing up against the 20-day SMA.
4. August 20th (and others) options are merely 40% IV pricing in a very low expected move.

&amp;#x200B;

**Concerns:**

* SEC is investigating payment-for-order-flow, which is key to this business.

Counter: CEO of Virtu has been on many media calls where he explains that as an MM they are actually creating price improvement on market-orders which would actually be executed at higher prices if they didn’t exist as an MM. 

[ (start at 3:00 for price improvement discussion)

&amp;#x200B;

* As re-opening continues, new traders will have less time to focus on active management.

Counter: Human nature makes habits very difficult to break. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Market-making is so profitable currently that competition will eat away profitability.

Counter: Existing relationships with brokerages. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Positions:**

[Positions](

**TLDR:** Meme stocks have continued into Q2 2021 with high volumes. Virtu Financial **(VIRT)** is an MM-firm which benefits from high-volumes, and growth of active investing without customer acquisition costs. VIRT has recently fallen due to a SEC investigation which lacks any evidence of wrong-doing to retail investors. Share repurchases are accelerating.

**The Market Opportunity**

Contrary to what many boomers say, electric vehicles are not a “trend” or a “fad”. It’s very reasonable to expect electric vehicles to account for an overwhelming majority of automotive sales by 2050, because of the Paris Agreement. Nearly every single nation in the world is a member of the Paris Agreement. The goal of it is to limit temperature increase to 1.5˚ C, and encourages countries to attempt to go carbon neutral by the year 2050.



Obviously one of the most significant contributors to carbon emissions are current gas powered cars. This is where electric vehicles come in.

The largest EV markets as of now are:



Just note that Europe as a whole, sells more EV’s than China.

In the short term, the best market will be Europe let me explain why.

**Europe’s Market Opportunity**

Europe is one of the most progressive places in the entire world, and they are taking climate change and the Paris agreement incredibly seriously. For example the UK, Sweden, Denmark, Ireland, and the Netherlands are planning to ban **ALL** ICE(Internal Combustion Engine) vehicles by 2030, and Norway is going to ban them by 2025. Germany as of now, is granting 11k to people who plan on purchasing EV’s, and many other countries in Europe offer significant financial incentives. For example, France just announced an 8.8 billion dollar package, which offers 12k euros(13.5k dollars) to people purchasing EV’s.

Europe has also passed new emissions standards which states that, “no more than 95g of carbon dioxide/km for passenger cars by 2021.”

In 2019, overall sales increased by **137% IN EUROPE**. **IN MARCH 2021, EV SALES INCREASED BY 169%**. Also in Norway, currently **18.1%** of vehicles **IN USE are PEV’s(Plug in Electric Vehicles).** Iceland is 5.5% and Sweden is 3.7% in 2020. Which is amazing. Many estimates by analysts say that by 2030 around 30% of all automotive sales will be Electric Vehicles. Personally I think this is incredibly conservative, seeing how serious many European Countries are, I will not be surprised if it reaches %40. The two most important countries will likely be France and Germany. Both countries have already passed multi billion dollar packages as incentives to purchase EV’s, and I think these trends will continue.

**INSANE STATISTIC**

**3 OUT OF 4 SALES IN NORWAY IS AN EV. AND HALF OF ALL SALES IN ICELAND. AND 1 OUT OF 3 SALES IN SWEDEN. IN MANY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES 1 OUT OF 10 SALES ARE ELECTRIC VEHICLES.**



Yearly EV growth rate in Europe:

Bull estimate: 100% growth in EV sales

INCREDIBLY Very Bull Estimate: 150% growth in EV sales

My estimate: 100% growth in EV sales

Bear estimate 40% growth in EV sales

Note: even the bear estimate is incredibly large

**China’s Market Opportunity**

As of writing, out of any individual nation, China has the largest electric vehicle market in the world. Though China isn’t as progressive as Europe, their EV market will also have huge growth. Call it good or bad, China’s government has complete authority of the economy. We’ve already seen it before, but with the snap of a finger China can put any law they want into existence. Thankfully for the EV market, China has made many laws pushing the use of EV’s.

For example, many cities have mandated that many ride hailing cars must be electric vehicles, and the government specifies a certain amount of new license plates go to EV’s.

Estimates show that by 2030, the EV sales will increase by 25% **EACH YEAR.** Bear estimate will be around 20%. China has been incredibly consistent with its growth. Very bull estimate will be 30%. I predict 25% growth in China.

**US Market Opportunity**

Arguably by far the least impressive. The government has done little to promote EV’s especially compared to other countries like Europe and China. The current president Joe Biden is very interested in EV’s and is attempting to pass many bills promoting their use. But I wouldn’t count on anything particular being passed. US EV growth was 17%, but over the past few years growth has slowed a lot.

**FINAL ESTIMATE FOR EV SALES END OF 2021 and 2022**

Using current sales figures and estimates for each individual country and the rest of the world here are my figures for yearly growth in total

My estimate 2021 growth and total: 40%

My estimate 2022 growth and total: 60%

Point is massive opportunity

**Overview of business:**

At its core, Poshmark is a platform that connects sellers of clothing with buyers. The founder, Manish Chandra often touts the ""social commerce"" element and continues to talk about social commerce as this is where he believes the moat of the business is. I wish he would stop, Poshmark isn't about social commerce, the true moat is empowerment.

**My experience with Poshmark:**

During the Pandemic, I grew interested in vintage clothing and began buying stuff on resale platforms and reselling it to an audience I've built on Instagram. I sell on instagram because most of the things I sell are $200+ and I find my margins to be around 40% so if I were to make $100 gross profit on a $200 sale and net $80 after shipping and other expenses, selling on a platform like Poshmark wouldn't makes sense as the fee to do so would be 20% of sale price: $40 on a $200 sale, AKA half my net profit. My resale activity is extremely niche and not a scaleable business. What I have found in doing it is that I need to source my inventory and I have bought items on Poshmark, Depop, Mercari, Ebay, Etsy, Grailed, and Facebook Marketplace. Ebay takes the cake, I find the most stuff on there and whenever I have tried to sell I move stuff quickest on Ebay. Poshmark is a close second. Over the winter I found the supply of stuff I could buy cheap on Poshmark and flip on Instagram outstanding. For the longest time, I couldn't understand why all these people would sell things on Poshmark as the percentage of each sale they take is the highest compared to their online marketplace competitors. Poshmark takes 20% of every sale above $15 and a flat $2.95 for sales below $15. Ebay takes around 10-15% (they have recently cut PayPal out of the payment processing and are now charging more and I know a lot of sellers are not happy). Etsy also has a long and complicated breakdown of what they charge, but its less than 20%, Grailed &amp; Depop take 10%, and Facebook marketplace takes 5%.

So why would anyone in their right mind sell something on Poshmark and pay a 20% fee when they could sell it on Facebook Marketplace and pay a 5% fee?

Isn't this whole industry about to compete in a race to the bottom where one platform with resources (like Facebook) can undercut the others and then another platform does the same until there is no profit left in the industry?

When I heard Poshmark was going to IPO I was thinking about buying puts or avoiding the stock altogether as my answer to these questions was people will move from where the fees are highest to where they are lowest. Because of this straightforward incentive, platforms will undercut each other until there is no profit and eventually there will be consolidation. When conducting some light DD on this thesis I spoke to a number of Poshmark sellers and did some digging, I changed my mind and went long shares at $75, then again at $68, then again at $62, then again at $57, then again at $56, then again at $47. Now, I am holding a massive bag of shit. When the stock crashed after Q1 earnings I was feeling very discouraged and although I was not considering selling, the 40% loss on my position stung. But, after seeing the stock crater another 8% yesterday on news they are planning to expand into India, I felt that maybe I should take a look at call prices. Before we get into options plays, I want to try and articulate what caused me to feel bullish about the stock.

**Poshmark's Competitive Advantage**

Poshmark's CEO, Manish Chandra, touts social commerce and ""posh parties"" similar to Tupperware parties as one of their key differentiators. I get a notification on my phone everyday that one of these parties is going on but I haven't been able to figure out what its about.

I see Poshmark's competitive advantages differently. Three come to mind.

The first is how easy it is to list an item on Poshmark. Take a photo, check a few boxes, name a price, and post. Compared to Ebay which is incredibly labor intensive and involves so many categories and sub-categories, Poshmark streamlines the process through having an efficient and easy to use UI.

The second competitive advantage is how easy it is for Poshmark sellers to ship items. Buyers pay for shipping and it is a flat rate of $7.45. When an item is sold on poshmark the buyer has to pay instantly (ebay does not have this feature and as a result sellers say 10%+ of items sold have buyers that do not pay and they have to go through the process of canceling and re-listing). When the item is sold Poshmark E-mails a shipping label to you, all you have to do is print it out and tape it on ANY box or packaging and either drop it at USPS or have them pick it up. It is incredibly easy.

Both of these attributes remove the barriers to entry that new sellers face. When you get started you want it to be easy and straightforward. Incredibly, Ebay and other platforms have fee structures that are difficult to understand, platforms that are difficult to use, and most require a PayPal to be set up as well.

The third competitive advantage is by far the most important and hardest to create and sustain. Poshmark has a fiercely loyal and passionate user base of sellers who swear by the platform. Some become ""[Poshmark ambassadors]( and receive next to nothing for being ambassadors. They do it because they love the platform. I have tried in vain to convince sellers to go around the platform. Consider a $200 item, if they sell it on Poshmark, they will net $160. If I am willing to pay $175 through PayPal and try and convince them it's a win win as I save $25 and they'll make $15 more, I should stand ready to take the wrath of the Poshmark ambassador who will report me to Poshmark and decline my offer.

Let's take a closer look at this third competitive advantage and see if it can help answer my question about why sellers would choose to sell on a platform that charges them a higher percentage of each sale. Why would they also loyally defend and promote this platform for few tangible benefits?

The answer is has to do more with psychology than with financial logic. The reason Poshmark was able to grow and compete is due to the first two competitive advantages I listed: it's easy to list, it's easy to ship, (and easy to get paid). Because it's easy to use sellers tell other sellers and buyers become sellers. We live in a market economy and with the rise of social media, large internet companies, and superstar founder entrepreneurs, the lives of entrepreneurs and the value they bring to society has been glorified. I think most people want to participate in the market economy, they want to be an entrepreneur, be their own boss, or have a ""side hustle"". Unfortunately, it's not easy and the few that succeed stand on a pile of failed ventures and crushed dreams. Poshmark makes it easy. Poshmark enables people who have been excluded from the wealth generating aspects of the online internet economy into successful participants. Broadly, those who haven't benefited from this new globalized economy have been: Women, racial minorities, geographic minorities (south, midwest). The demographics of Poshmark sellers and users closely align with those who have been excluded. The vast majority of Poshmark sellers are women, I was unable to find an exact number but in Poshmark's [2020 social commerce report]( a survey conducted by Zogby Analytics had a user response rate that was 97% female. In this same report, Poshmark states that ""the south dominates"" and that 35% of sellers live in the south and 37% of buyers live in the south. [Poshmark's real product is empowerment.]( Their platform empowers women and minorities (racial and geographic) by making it easy for them to feel successful and have a side hustle. Empowerment is an incredible feeling for those who haven't felt it before and Poshmark makes it possible for millions to feel this way.

**Why Wall Street Misunderstands Poshmark**

In order to find an investment that can provide outsized returns, it's important to have an information advantage over the consensus view. Wall Street does not understand this stock because broadly speaking Wall Street is an information laggard when it comes to valuing companies that provide products and services primarily to women. I've made similar investments in Lululemon and Revolve that have preformed extremely well as the consensus changed. As investors have seen this pattern play out over and over Wall Street investors have started to ""ask their wife"" or ""pay attention to their daughter"" in looking for innovative companies. The problem with Poshmark's stock is that the types of people who work on Wall Street analyzing stocks and their wives don't use poshmark, and neither do their daughters.

When I was looking into the management at Poshmark I noticed Serena Williams is a board member. I am an avid tennis fan and as such I have a favorite player: Roger Federer. Everyone loves Federer, he is a class act and attracts sponsorships from the likes of Rolex, Mercedes, Netjets, Rimowa, Swiss coffee machine makers, and has an ownership stake in On Running. These are brands Wall Streeters love! Serena Williams has a different public perception. On court she in an incredible competitor with a lot of passion which sometimes translates into dramatic meltdowns and aggressive behavior towards [umpires]( and [linesmen]( She has sponsorships from Nike, Gatorade, PUMA, Wilson, Pepsi etc. The respective brand deals the players have represent their public image and who they will be most effective in marketing towards. Serena Williams’s image is used to target a demographic of consumers that is antithetical to the types of people Roger Federer’s image is used for. Think about who evaluates and writes research on stocks. Its Federer fans, it's Rolex wearing, Swiss latte sipping 25-50 year olds who love the class and sophistication of Federer. Now think about the users of Poshmark, its young women, women of color, and women living in geographic areas that have taken a lot of the brunt of globalization. Serena Williams is the perfect match for Poshmark as she represents their user demographics much better than Federer ever could. But, Wall Street loves Federer and therefore has overlooked this stock.

**Financials and Valuation**

Etsy recently bought Depop for 1.6B when Depop had 70M in revenue in the previous year. This equates to a Price to Sales ratio of 22.85. Poshmark's market cap at its current share price of $36.25 is 2.72 Billion. Last year they did 262M in revenue For a P/S ratio of 10.3. Remember, Depop is an inferior platform for sellers and barely has a useable website. Why did it sell for double to P/S ratio Poshmark is selling for now?

**Potential Catalysts / The Set Up**

Poshmark is expanding across the globe entering multiple new markets each year. Yesterday, 8/2, [Poshmark announced they will be expanding into India]( and the stock tanked 7.5%.

A few months ago Poshmark announced a [partnership with Snapchat]( I am very excited about this partnership as I am bullish on Facebook and Snapchat and see commerce as an important new opportunity for both of these platforms.

Poshmark is also expanding horizontally into different categories such as pets and home and because of their asset light model they can throw shit at the wall and see what sticks.

Set up wise, this is more of a reopening play than a covid play but it is being looked at and valued as if it should've benefited from the lockdowns. Because Poshmark is an E-commerce company, Wall Street has been harsh on them for not growing as fast as some of their ""peers"". Except their ""peers"" aren't true peers as sites like Etsy are more diversified in the products sold on their platform with a heavier weight on arts and crafts and other activities that thrive when people have more time at home. Clothing is not something people look to buy when stuck at home. As the economy continues to reopen and people start working and going out again sales will pick up. This very well may be reflected in Q2 earnings.

Short interest is 30% (4.75M/15M outstanding as of 7/15). I am not looking at this trade as a short squeeze but if shorts do decide to cover the stock could begin to run and run fast.

**The Trade**

Shares are the safest play. There are limited options available on Poshmark with spreads I could drive a truck through. The furthest out are Feb 18, 2022. $65 is the highest strike available. Because of the spreads, uncertainty of when an upside move will occur, and lack of long dated options, I only own shares. Second Quarter earnings are coming up on 8/10 with guidance of $79.0 million - $81.0 million in Revenue and $1.5 million - $2.5 million in Adjusted EBITDA. I am fairly confidant they will beat the guidance they set for themselves but unsure if this will result in a massive move to the upside. I think it could take more time.

I have a fairly high conviction in this trade and am posting to get feedback and thoughts from others, that said Poshmark is only 10%+ of my portfolio and I want to crowdsource my ideas a bit more before I buy options or decide to sell other investments to buy more.

**TLDR**

Poshmark empowers women. This is their competitive advantage. Wall Street doesn't get this.O","Poshmark BULL DD: Its not Roger Federer, but who says you can't make some money on Serena Williams",21,11

People who drink this stuff are absolutely addicted. Healthy company financially, relatively undervalued compared to peers and potential short term catalysts via expansion into seltzers or acquisition due to an aging CEO and majority owner.

# FIZZ IN MY PANTS

This is a ticker that has been stalling out on supremely low volume lately, but one that has a load of potential catalysts &amp; volatility currently unaccounted for in the share or derivative prices.

I present to you: **National Beverage Corp**. aka **$FIZZ** aka your girlfriend's/wife's/girl you stalk's favorite beverage company that she doesn't know about aka owners of La Croix.

This is a **weird** fucking company. The CEO owns something like 80% of the total shares. He is very old, and I'm not sure if anyone knows what his plans are for the company in the near term as he considers riding off into the sunset. Here is why I think they are worth a lil play:

# Market/Opportunity/Continuation of shift in consumer preferences

So Ronaldo moves a Coke bottle and says ""agua"" and the world loses its fucking mind - wipes out 4b in Coke's market cap. Overreaction right? Maybe not. GenZ goes nuts for this stuff, **81% of La Croix consumers drink at least one per day** \- that is crack. 

There has been a not-so-secret shift towards healthier beverages over the past several years. All of these social media influencers and athletes are pushing (generally via sponsorship but sometimes candidly as was the case with Ronaldo) healthy beverages and lifestyles. Kids these days want to look and feel like these influencers and are shunning the sugary high cal drinks and going after 0 cal, 0 sugar replacements or ""fat burning"" energy drinks. La Croix is leading the way in this sparkling zero calorie water category - it is pretty much agua. They hardly advertise, and the likes of Coke and Pepsi can't even fucking catch up; it's remarkable.



If you do drink La Croix, you'll have noticed that they are now putting out new flavors all the time - addressing my main beef with them in the last couple years of having a generally weak and limited flavor rotation. Also, (**potential** **catalyst alert**) **if and when FIZZ makes the leap into alcoholic beverages** and produces a La Croix seltzer??? Prepare for liftoff.

# Financials

FIZZ has strong financials, excellent margins, an optimistic growth outlook, and very low levels of debt to boot. Here are some key stats:

**Forward P/E**: 23 (compare to Monster Energy @ 35 and Coke @ 25)

**PEG (higher means more overvalued)**: 2.85 (MNST @ 3.66 KO @ 2.85)

**ROE - return on equity** (I like this one because it shows how effective management is generating profits based on total shareholder equity): 43% (MNST @ 31% and KO @ 37%) - worth noting all of these are fantastic given that the S&amp;P averages somewhere around 15%

Generally speaking, FIZZ is undervalued relative to some of the other major players in the beverage market. The most surprising part is the level of short interest based on these fundamentals alone. And no, i'm not saying this is a short squeeze opportunity, however that doesn't mean that is not a potential catalyst.

# Acquisition?

(**Potential catalyst alert)** I don't know if there is a ton of precedent as to what happens when someone (an 85 year old at that) owns the vast majority of a publicly traded company. All I am saying is that the big players have been chasing this sparkling water juggernaut for years. Coke seems to have chosen their horse with Topo Chico, but would not be surprised to see another player enter the ring in a bid to take over this company with huge upside potential. **This one just screams acquisition or LBO to me**. Buyouts = premium.

# Technical Analysis

I do think there is some value in looking at the charts from a purely technical standpoint. Given that most trading is done by algorithms now, we have seen a deep downwards channel that has been in place since the January FIZZ squeeze. **This is despite the fact that FIZZ continues to beat earnings and operate with healthy metrics and growth prospects.**

So, this strikes me as an **either/or** scenario (without any other catalyst) - they will continue to track this downwards channel through the $43 relative bottom (abandon ship if this occurs), or they will reverse the trend and break back up to 50. MACD looks good for the first time in a couple months. FIZZ is in desperate need of some news that attracts attention and volume. Here is a chart with lines - bitches love lines:

&amp;#x200B;

[ignore the Jan squeeze, this thing needs to rebound soon](

# RISKS

Mainly competitive, supply chain, and the fact that the dude owns the whole damn company. Also, a pretty ugly chart this year but maybe the worst is over.

Its RSI is approaching 90. Moderna went from $235 to $365.

I understand they delivered wonders for humanity with effective COVID vaccines, but the magnitude of the surge is highly unusual. 

1) Delta - The variant is not exactly news at this point. The world has already gone through 3 major waves. This wave isn’t expected to be as bad as last winter’s, when BioN stock actually fell from $130 to $85 between early Dec 2020 &amp; early Jan 2021.

2) Earnings - Since Pfizer reported earnings last week, BioN has run up another 25% since then. (They split vaccine revenues 50-50.) A large earnings beat should be more than priced in already.

3) Total Addressable Market

3a) Government deals - BioN &amp; Moderna raised their vaccine prices in the latest EU contract. But this has been known for some time. The US government might push back against similar price increases.

3b) Booster shots - CDC has said booster shots are likely NOT needed for fully-vaccinated, otherwise healthy adults. Without recurring revenue, they would appear to be priced too richly (Moderna &gt;20 forward P/E) for a largely one-time, even if multi-year, windfall.

There will also be political pushback against hoarding boosters for wealthy countries if most of the developing world hasn’t yet received their initial doses.

3c) Future products - No doubt both companies gained brand value from their covid vaccine, but future products are still years down the road.

4) Short interest - neither stock has unusually high short interest (&lt;1% BioN, &lt;4% Moderna) so it doesn’t appear to be a squeeze.

I don’t doubt both stocks can be worth $1,000+ by the end of this decade if they deliver other successful drugs. But a near-doubling in a month is crazy ... does anyone have some insights?",Why are BioNTech &amp; Moderna up 5% every day on no news? (Fundamental analysis),53,7

Space is a fairly new industry in terms of traditional stock market exposure/risk, but in most situations it’s often the newer fields and technologies that have the best asymmetrical upside for investors.

Now I’ve always been a fan of space and the development of aerospace technologies for my entire life, but I’ve also been an investor (aka degenerate gambler). 

Astra and Rocket Lab are both companies that produce rockets that are/have gone public via SPAC this year. Rocket Lab will complete its merger on August 20th after an investor vote but when it does it’s likely to behave the same way astra did. When Astra merged with its SPAC the price pumped hard from $10-$11 up over $15 before crashing down to $8 currently.

This is basically pure hype and the fact that investors want good exposure to the space industry. Rocket Lab is a massively undervalued company that is known as the best small satellite launch provider in the world. It uses high strength carbon fiber to build reusable rockets which can fire into very direct and specific orbits better then traditional larger providers like SpaceX. But it’s biggest value comes in the fact that they are using their position as the current best and most used small sat launcher to develop medium lift rockets capable of competing directly with the SpaceX Falcon 9. They also have developed the first modular and modifiable commercial spacecraft. 

Within the next two years Rocket Lab will be sending a private scientific mission to Venus to show off the capability of the worlds first commercially available and modifiable Photon spacecraft (essentially a bulky satellite for interplanetary travel) that it expects to sell to governments and universities etc around the world. Think also about the companies interested in asteroid mining which could use these too. 

Astra on the other hand has a specific but great niche. They are run by former NASA people and are dedicated to the idea of simplification and scaling. They are very far along with their development of a rocket small enough to fit into a shipping container but simple enough to be mass produced. They want to be the Cessna to spaceX’s 737. It’s a good idea. There are plans to have an American lunar base within a decade and the Russians and Chinese have the same goal and timeline. There is a lot of support and commercial opportunities that can come from the establishment of bases like these.

See, we are at the beginning of a space race, China sent a rover with the specific design and intention of finding the best place to put a manned Martian base, as well as their deployment of a Chinese space station. This stuff is getting real spicy and the market has not factored in the tremendous growth that comes with the sheer number of people who can benefit from accessing space whether it’s for colonization, mining, exploration, scientific endeavors/experimentation, or most importantly manufacturing. (When you don’t worry about gravity gravity doesn’t squash the thing you’re 3D printing before you print the rest of the support structure). 

The upside is insane and it’s being overlooked because space is seen as risky and crowded and people are wary of SPACs. These two specific companies, especially Rocket Lab, fill a fantastic niche not filled by anyone else. The drive and scientific intent of their founders/CEOs are the type of exploration oriented drive that will actually propel innovation instead of just sitting and doing the bare minimum like Blue Origin, ULA, or some of the other larger standard launch providers do. Those companies are about to be disrupted on a massive scale. 

Rocket Lab is trading at about $10 as Vector Acquisition but post merger we could expect a massive spike in valuation as the more wary investors pile in after the SPAC risk is over. The options are cheap as hell on both companies too. Because Astra is basically the only other new small launch provider that’s public it makes sense that an increased valuation and bullish run on the price of Rocket Lab will correspond with the same investors diversifying risk into Astra as well (which is seen by investors as an equivalent small sat launcher), causing a pump. 

Considering the merger vote meeting is planned for the 20th of this month, I’m surprised that IV isn’t higher for Rocket Lab or Astra, but it’s beginning to trend upwards as more investors decide to sink some change into the company. It’s surprising to me how little coverage this stock has gotten. It’s going to be a massive story when it blows up this month, but for now everyone seems to be silent. They have the technical understanding, the track record, multiple government contracts already, and the prospect of a space race all going for them, that’s some deep value if I’ve ever seen it. I realized this opportunity not from researching the stock but from the company itself, I love space and I am a fan of following the rapid development of the industry. A whole lot of people are starting to plan businesses around space and investing big bucks, and they all need a rocket to get them there. The fact that Rocket Lab is setting itself up with the Neutron medium lift rocket to directly compete with SpaceX is alone a massive indicator of future value. SpaceX is valued over $70 billion and the current valuation of Rocket Lab is just $4 billion. That’s a lot of room for growth.

$SPCE is a good play but it is a space tourism company and they still value it at $10 billion, these companies have such a broader and consistent consumer base as compared to something as risky and unfounded as space tourism, which indicates the massive undervaluation situation we have in RKLB and ASTR.

Disclaimer: I own a bunch of options that expire on 9/17 in both companies as well as more then 50 shares of each in underlying stock. 


TL:DR; because of global politics and reduced costs of rockets, Rocket Lab ($RKLB) and Astra ($ASTR) are set up to become massive mid to large cap businesses tho they trade at absurdly low valuations today.",Deep Value plays in the space industry: $RKLB and $ASTR (undervalued options opportunity),279,13

# BACKGROUND INFO

23andMe has been trading on the NASDAQ for just over a month.

Prior to being listed as $ME - it was being traded as a SPAC  - A shell company created by Sir FUCKING Richard Branson a.k.a. the biggest virgin on the planet. (Owner of Virgin Atlantic Airways and Virgin Mobile and a bunch of other companies).

If you don't know, 23andMe is a saliva based testing kit which can be sent to your home. It's completely retard-friendly. All you have to do is send them a sample of your already overflowing drool. With this sample, they can complete genetic testing and analyze changes in DNA structure and sequence.

According to the 23andMe kit I am 69% Neanderthal. This explains my sloped forehead and why I dream in IMAX.

When it was announced that Richard Branson's SPAC would acquire 23andMe - it shot up to a high of $18.16 from an average of $10. (This was prior to 23andMe even being listed.) After the initial rise and fall, the price settled back to $10 and was kept there until the shareholders could vote on the acquisition of 23andMe.

23andMe is backed not only by Richard Branson but is headed by CEO and co-founder of $ME - Anne Wojcicki. She is sister to Susan Wojcicki (Current CEO of Youtube). Anne was also married for a while to Sergey Brin (co-founded of Google).

She developed 23andMe after working as a health care investment analyst for a San Francisco investment fund . She was displeased with the way investment firms viewed biotech's and set out to create her own world-changing company.

# POTENTIAL

Originally, 23andMe offered tests which would map out your genetic make-up i.e. your ancestry. God knows your ancestors who migrated from Africa hundreds of thousand of years ago are looking down on you with immense shame.

In 2015 the FDA gave 23andMe approval for tests which could include various types of cancers, Alzheimer's, cystic fibrosis, Parkinson's, sickle cell anemia, Gaucher's disease, early onset dystonia, and many more hereditary ailments.

Also in 2015 they announced a partnership with GlaxoSmithKlien to use the genetic mapping of over 5 million customers to design new drugs.

In 2020 GlaxoSmithKlien announced their first joint clinical trial regarding cancer treatment - working with client DNA they had gotten from 23andMe.

$ME has a potential DATA MINE of genetic information. Imagine knowing if a certain illness runs in your family and your own propensity for it - with information like this ahead of time, one can be more easily prepared and can catch it even before symptoms start.

Easy to use and streamlined tests like this are the future. The technology will only get better and medications will only improve with the amount of people opting to have their DNA analyzed further by 23andMe &amp; their partners.

# METRICS / DATES

23andMe TEST KITS WERE ONE OF THE TOP 5 SELLERS THIS YEAR ON AMAZON'S PRIME DAY.

AUGUST 13th, 2021 - 11:00AM EDT is 23andMe's 2nd Quarter Earnings Call!

As I said before - the price went from $10 to a high of $18.16 even before the merger. Yesterday $ME closed at $8.23 (Ending in the aftermarket at $8.35). This is LOWER than pre-merger prices and we're still in the EARLY DAYS of the company.

Put in a stop loss and see where this thing goes. The long-term upside is enormous and the downside is scarce. You'd currently be paying LESS than what early investors paid.

**52 week HIGH - 18.16**

**52 week LOW - 7.72**

**$3.19B MARKET CAP**

Get in low while you can. Now would be a great time to buy ahead of earnings.

My positions: 



Maybe if we all come together, we can have the 23 chromosomes required to be labeled as a 'normal functioning human being.'

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR &amp; ELI5:** 23andMe ($ME) has huge names behind it. Potential is high. Earnings are on the 13th. Prices are a steal. I hope you enjoyed my Ted-Talk.

Long story short, these are the plans for 2030:

- US is dedicating $52 Billion into increased chip capacity

- EU is dedicating $160 Billion into increased chip capacity

- South Korea is dedicating $450 Billion into increased chip capacity

&gt; In June, analysts at consultancy Bain &amp; Company said building capacity would “hurt the economics” of suppliers, since each will likely run production lines below capacity once demand abates.

It’s generally accepted that chip manufacturing facilities take years to bring operations up to rate, and the concern is that these particularly long break even periods will be extended even further if global capacity increases simultaneously.

Obviously this bodes well for companies where chips represent a substantial portion of finished product costs (such as AMD), but I am too uncaffeinated to make an educated guess as to what else will happen. Will chip manufacturers have to sell off assets when supply exceeds demand? Will there be piles of semiconductors stuffed in every kitchen drawer in the world? Will Dad ever acknowledge me? The world may never know.

What we do know is that chip shortages are going to be happening for a while, till they aren’t. Plan accordingly.

Do not read this post. 

""But Rhodes and other analysts were quick to note that BlackBerry QNX is hardly a one-trick pony when it comes to automotive software"".  

From: [

""An anchor of Kanata’s autonomous vehicles sector is still in the driver’s seat when it comes to developing emerging AV technology despite Ford’s decision to drop the company’s infotainment platform from its vehicles, industry analysts told OBJ Thursday. 

The world’s No. 3 automaker made headlines (...) when it announced it was ditching BlackBerry QNX’s system that controlled tasks such as syncing mobile phones for hands-free calling and powering interactive maps in favour of an Android-based platform from Google.

That means that starting in 2023, apps such as Google Maps will now be available in millions of Ford and Lincoln vehicles without requiring an Android smartphone.

Ford joins a growing number of other car manufacturers, including Volvo, General Motors and the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, that have turned to Google to power their infotainment systems in recent years. 

As a result, BlackBerry QNX ​– which employs about 400 people at its flagship Kanata R&amp;D facility ​– has seen its share of the infotainment software market fall from nearly 50 per cent in 2017 to 28 per cent last year, according to market research firm IHS Markit. Ford’s move will only hasten that decline.

## Not a one-trick pony

“Ford was a significant piece of business for QNX – there’s no doubt about it,” says Brian Rhodes, IHS Markit’s Michigan-based research manager for connected cars, noting that the manufacturer accounted for more than a fifth of QNX’s infotainment software business in 2020. “There’s a gap there.”

But Rhodes and other analysts were quick to note that BlackBerry QNX is hardly a one-trick pony when it comes to automotive software. 

The company designs a variety of software systems used in cars made by Ford and other manufacturers, including telematics that underpins technology such as GPS navigation systems as well as assisted and autonomous driving platforms. Infotainment is just one of these systems, and experts say its relative importance to BlackBerry QNX’s business is waning.

 Rhodes notes that the Waterloo-based company has been funnelling many of its resources into enhancing the safety and security of its real-time operating systems. He says BlackBerry QNX is “incredibly strong and getting stronger” at developing secure, connected platforms that control everything from airbags to autonomous parking systems. 

As an example, he points to BlackBerry’s recent decision to expand its business partnership with Chinese search engine giant Baidu. 

Under the deal, Baidu’s high-definition maps will be integrated into BlackBerry’s QNX Neutrino real-time operating system in millions of electric cars manufactured by GAC Group, one of China’s top three automakers. 

“I think that’s exactly how they’re trying to position their business going forward,” Rhodes explains. “It’s really just phasing into a different part of their business.”

Ottawa-based automotive industry expert Barrie Kirk agrees. 

 While calling Ford’s decision unfortunate, Kirk says it wasn’t all that surprising considering the widespread industry shift toward Android-based infotainment systems.

He notes that BlackBerry QNX has spent years building a strong reputation for developing secure software focused on other aspects of automotive technology such as autonomous driving systems, adding the company caters to a wide variety of other industries, including the medical sector. 

## 'A solid company'

“This is disappointing, but let’s keep it in perspective,” says Kirk, the executive director of the Canadian Automated Vehicles Centre of Excellence. “It’s a solid company with a broad market and a well-respected product line.”

Rhodes adds that while Silicon Valley giants such as Google and others might find it relatively easy to make hay in the realm of infotainment software, building robust operating systems that can stand up to cyber attacks and other security threats is a much tougher nut to crack. And that’s where BlackBerry QNX excels.

“The infotainment space has always been ripe for disruption,” Rhodes explains. “The barrier to entry certainly needs scale, but there are a lot of tech companies with a lot of scale out there.

“The safety-critical space, you can’t buy 50 years of automotive experience, except (through) acquisition. It’s a more secure position to have that niche in – no pun intended.”

Kirk says he hopes that Ford will continue to collaborate with BlackBerry QNX on other ventures at the automaker’s $340-million Ottawa Research and Engineering Centre on Palladium Drive, which employs hundreds of ex-BlackBerry workers.

But no matter what happens, he sees a bright future ahead for a firm that’s shown a knack for weathering storms. 

“This is the same BlackBerry that really adjusted very well as its smartphone business diminished,” he says. “They reinvented themselves in a big way and did a very successful job of that. I’m very confident that they’ll do well, and they'll adjust and keep growing.”

TLDR: This is just one example of what is really going on behind the bearish bullshit articles flooding the space.
Bb lost the infotainment contract with F but that does not encompass the totality of their working relationship. Articles have been and probably will continue to be framed in a bearish lean for the foreseeable future. Do your own dd

* **Revenue**  was RMB205,740 million (US$31,865 million), an increase of 34%  year-over-year. Excluding the consolidation of Sun Art, our revenue  would have grown 22% year-over-year to RMB187,306 million (US$29,010  million).
* **Annual active consumers**  of the Alibaba Ecosystem across the world reached approximately 1.18  billion for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, an increase of 45  million from the twelve months ended March 31, 2021.

The year-over-year decreases were primarily  due to our investments in strategic areas to capture incremental  opportunities, such as Community Marketplaces, Taobao Deals, Local  Consumer Services and Lazada, as well as our increased spending on  growth initiatives within China retail marketplaces, such as Idle Fish  and Taobao Live, and our support to merchants.
* **Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders** was RMB45,141 million (US$6,991 million), and **net income** was RMB42,835 million (US$6,634 million). **Non-GAAP net income**  was RMB43,441 million (US$6,728 million), an increase of 10%  year-over-year, mainly due to an increase in share of profit of equity  method investees.
* **Diluted earnings per ADS** was RMB16.38 (US$2.54) and **diluted earnings per share** was RMB2.05 (US$0.32 or HK$2.46). **Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS** was RMB16.60 (US$2.57), an increase of 12% year-over-year and **non-GAAP diluted earnings per share** was RMB2.08 (US$0.32 or HK$2.50), an increase of 12% year-over-year.

Background:  The eviction moratorium began as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) signed into law in March 2020 as a 120-day eviction moratorium for rental properties that are part of **federal assistance programs** or are subject to federally backed loans. Some, but not all, states adopted their own temporary eviction moratorium as well. The CARES Act eviction moratorium expired in July 2020. The CDC then imposed its own eviction moratorium halting residential evictions. Congress temporarily extended the CDC order once, and then the CDC extended it several more times to 30 June 2021.

So, you are probably thinking that what happens next is an enlightening conversation on government intervention and clear overstepping of authority by the centers for disease and control.  You, like everyone else, is wondering if the power is going to go out while your tendies are still cooking in the microwave by the great depression 2.  Do you sense a disturbance in the force?  Millions of voices crying out as the door hits their ass on the way out?  Well my fellow retard, you just clicked on a Slut\_Spoiler shitpost discussion, and it's too late now.  The synthesizer is riffing and you have to wait at least until Rick Astley starts singing.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been searching for a while online how I can live that ""not much but honest life"" of a dairy farmer that milks the government.  I was raised to be a contributing member of society and still trying to break the habit.  You probably noticed I bolded text in the first paragraph.  It's important to note that this moratorium only affects those with less than 99k in gross income or twice that for a family.  Further, to be eligble for that, you have to show you have been actively seeking employment.  Wow, 99k gross income!  That's a lotta fucking people! and everyone with a friend named Reggie can verify, committing fraud by showing that you are actively looking for employment is easy to do.  Almost as easy as making an ineligible resume on a napkin. This is the classic unemployment benefits hustle.

One time I got a resume from a guy.  It was an e-mail.  Said  ""I am electrician"".  That was it.  That was this guys Resume, Cover Letter, and Curriculum Vitae, but his Modus Operandi was being able to show the unemployment office that he had contacted us and put his best foot forward to get a job.  Well, that's another month of making more money than you would get working (California).  According to the GOV, he has made an effort to get employment.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, there are a few more bylaws in there to protect you.  The wording is very lose.  ""If you **may** become homeless or be forced to live in a more crowded space"" you are eligible for the federal program.  Not sure how they plan on enforcing that, but it's beside the point.  As long as you aren't being violent or destructive you can't be kicked out.

&amp;#x200B;

This word ""may"" is a problem for me.  As in:  ""You **may** have an enormous back rent bill when the moratorium terminates.  If so, you **may** want to consider using the federal aid to help"".  Even after not paying rent for months and getting unemployment, the federal government still has programs to help those in need.  There isn't going to be a crisis. there isn't going to be global crash in the housing market.  There is going to be a bunch of people on vacation getting called back to reality.

&amp;#x200B;

So let's throw out some scenarios.  Scenario Alpha: What we have is tennant A who hasn't paid his rent for a year and 4 months, and we have tennant B across the street who has done the same thing.  How much money have they saved? to just put a rent number out there (I'll use $1,000) and multiplying it by 16 months is going to give you an impressive cushion: $16,000.  These guys making 99k and under, with $16,000 savings aren't worried about being kicked out, because they are just going to move across the street.  Tennant A and Tennant B will do an apartment swap, the landlords gets fucked over and the crisis is averted.  The landlords of these tennants just want someone to come in who will pay, and guess who's been building up a nice nest egg?  Obviously, these tennants have to leave.  The bridge is burned.  Would you let some guy who's been pennyfarthing about with your money stay?  At a certain point, this shit gets personal.

&amp;#x200B;

Scenario Omega: Landlord finally is able to remove his tennant.  He jumps for joy that he can start collecting rent again from an actively employed tennant.  The last guy leaves, looks for a house, and puts down a down payment.  Thanks to his savings.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing to think about is that this is giving people OPPURTUNITY.  They are out of work, everywhere is hiring.  Always wanted to live in New York? the Governor is begging for people to come and get mugged.  Want to go to anywhere in the US and start your life over?  It's totally possible when there aren't any strings attached to you like job and rent, and you can afford the cost of starting over.

Finally, I think that the real DD will be in the comments, which is a common theme with you animals.  As for me, I've paid rent this whole time LIKE AN IDIOT.  However, being honest is kind of the only thing that helps me sleep at night.  That and not jeopardizing the roof over my head.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr invest in $UHAL.  I'm sure business will be booming even more than it already has.

Large increases in monthly selling like this by top executives have been some of best 1-3 month shorts with 100-400% in gains.

Seriously tho, who buys anything they see on SNAP?? Sure the app is fun and a few good dick pic sends were had, but as a business, I'd much rather advertise on FB/TWTR/instagram/GOOGL/AMZN. SNAP is now 10x the bottom of march 2020 crash just 1.5 years ago, pretty extreme for 112% sales growth TTM (that they are spending billions on in software development to achieve).

I think a gap fill to $64 is likely here in the next few months. Lack of buyers post-earnings and the fresh low of $73.50 today looking very bearish. Great way to hedge to the downside if market pulls back again.

# Real Estate Play?

Wait... they just take pictures of houses and shet. idgaf. Housing market gonna crash and we're all gonna kiss Burry's ass again. Trash play.

Well... sort of, let's do an analogy.

If stonks go up, who makes money?

1. Bulls
2. The brokers earning commission from you apes

If stonks go down, who makes money?

1. 🌈 🐻
2. The brokers earning commission from you apes

Matterport is the tool that brokers use. They have contracts with Redfin, apartments.com, vacasa, etc

Listing sites like Zillow and Airbnb also support user uploaded Matterport imaging.

Buy, sell, rent, hotel, BnB, market up, market down, ERRYTHANG!

In other words, they're gonna make money regardless of real estate market.

# Stats:

bigger numbers lead to bigger tendies

total revenue: $26.9mill (+108% YoY)

Subscribers: 331,000 (+500+% YoY)

\# of Spaces under Matterport Management: 5 mill +

Annual Recurring Revenue: $55+ million

150+ countries and counting

# Covid/Recovery Play:

Is it too late to play covid? maybe, but Florida thinks otherwise.

Online shopping/home improvement: Rather than annoying the living shet outta amazon by returning the 9/10 items you just bought, you can virtually place the item in your home and see how it fits or looks.

When you're stuck at home gong crazy staring at the wall, you might plan your next trip. Resorts, hotels, parks, vacation sites. While everyone is stuck at home, these places'll use Matterport to instill as much FOMO as they can to get customers to line up once the pandemic is over.

# Other Streams of Revenue/Applications:

Retail: You ever buy something at Ikea, bring it home, assemble it, and find out it doesn't fit correctly or it doesn't match the fungshui of your living room? Neither have I, but I'm sure someone has. And Matterport can help you see whether your curtains will match that bean bag you always wanted. Aside from this, retailers have instructions from corporate on their store layout and shelving. Matterport will play a big role in facilitating this so that these managers don't have to drive/fly to every city in their jurisdiction.

VR/AR: They have a deal with Face mother f-ing Book. That deal was just for research and AI. You know what else FB owns? Oculus. MTTR can easily enter VR/AR space with their technology to enter the gaming and 'adult' industries.

# Short Interest:

IDGAF about the short interest. They're gonna make bank and that'll lead to me to making bank. I like the stock. and tbh, I'm such an ape, I don't even know how to reliably check short interest. I just like the stock.

# PR:

If you create the world's best invention; you'll still be dirt poor if no one knows about it. The same goes with stocks. Matterport just hired 2 new PR specialists in the past 2 months - a VP of Investor relations Soohwan Kim, and VP International marketing, Vivian Weiying Pan. If you didn't know about Matterport before, you'll know about it now. More people = more investors = stonks going up

So first off, I've been in this trade since Friday, and my fault for not at least posting before this morning, I meant to finish writing this last night. But it's a longer term strategy and one day should not derail the overall goal. 

So here's the deal. I've been waiting on this trade almost all of this year.  I rarely trade TSLA or popular meme stocks in general. But there's a trade setting up that is similar to the rolling QQQ trade from 2020. First I want to say this trade only sees it's true potential when there's a prolonged move for an asset in either direction at almost a straight line, which is very rare in equities. 

Taking a step back, another requirement for this trade to come to fruition is that the general bull market in equities continues higher from this point. Length and magnitude don't have to be too large, but another couple months, and another 250 S&amp;P points or so is required.  

With the backdrop of a continuing bull market, by which the case can be made for many reasons I won't go into here, and what I'm about to lay out, now is the time to enter an 8-10 week trade, using a **specific rolling weekly strategy on TSLA,** beginning this morning.

In parabolic bull markets, and specifically in individual names and leaders of those bull markets, proportional growth ratios become a big part of the price action leading into the acceleration phases. One can argue that TSLA itself is the clear leader of this particular bull market, the original meme stock flag-bearer, arguably sharing the title with the likes of AMD.

Taking an outside look at the growth patterns of TSLA's stock during this historic bull run, TSLA shows the most defined fractal pattern, indicating constant proportional growth near the ratio of the golden mean.. than any other leaders. And that makes sense given that it represents this bull market as a whole. Attached are some representations of this growth rate and it's respective pattern. It doesn't need to be complicated.















 (backdrop of M0 fueling bull run)





Given this rare setup, I think the rally to 900 will be almost linear and weekly call options beginning with 8/6 will return over 1000%. At which point **1/3 of total proceeds will be rolled into 8/13 before close Friday.**  This strategy will allow for the errant negative week to occur, or even two in a row.  The expected return on this trade by October end is in the order of 200x original trade size.  It sounds crazy.  I'll explain it more in a bit.



Given the set up has reached maturity, and with the assumption that the S&amp;P continues it's bull run over the next 8-10 weeks, and given whom I consider it's sister company leading this bull market, AMD, already made it's own linear run through all time highs.. as well as others like SQ approaching new highs today on acquisition news or NVDA's recent run to substantial new highs. I'm making the assumption that TSLA will continue it's bull run after a 6 month consolidation, and make new highs which by definition are above 900. 

I think the new rally will peak at about $1350. These are all signs &amp; indications of a blow-off top phase of a general bull market that could last any range of timeframes, but as we've seen some of the most amazing moves in equities can happen during these times, and this trade hones in on one specific move that will be looked at in the context of a bigger picture when it's all said and done. The time and opportunity to make a trade like this is now.  More perfect would have been this morning. But if the thesis is right, the move will be nearly linear and there won't be many opportunities for a pullback.

**Enter for 8/6 to start the roll.   740c**

**Looking for TSLA to close the week out about $805**

It has been doing it for weeks. Anytime we have seen a sell and gap down, it has bounced off of VWAP.

As we look at Gamma Exposure, there is a large call wall at 441 which has given resistance today. Also, there was LOTS of puts that were purchased last week that expire today which is keeping S&amp;P currently. 

440 is current Gamma flip point with some support at 435. VWAP and Gamma confluence. But I also think a close below 435 could bring more weakness.

What I'll be looking for towards the end of cash open, is whether we see a pump or dump. 

A sell and close around 436, I'll take a shot at swinging some longs.

I wanted to present another stock that's climbing through the ranks on Psy's Buys. I know the Apes of WSB are always looking for stupid and risky plays! So, let me show you one that I think you're going to love: AMKR

First, starting with the weeklies!

&amp;#x200B;

[AMKR Weeklies!](

First, the last 2 weeks have been bullish! Yeah buddy! But, let's take a look at the MACD. First, the Histogram has been on an upwards slope, meaning that the bulls are gaining strength or the bears are losing it. Doesn't matter, treats for a ferret! The MACD line itself made an upwards climb at the end of last week as well, meaning the short term ema is climbing faster than the intermediate ema! Prices do be climbing! So we're bullish on the intermediate! Dook Dook! If you take a look at the histogram, it's near 0. If it goes above 0, we've got an **intermediate** term Bull Signal! I think that might happen within the next couple of weeks.

Now, let's get to everyone's favorite place: The Dailies

&amp;#x200B;

[AMKR Dailies](

Now, let's go into the dailies. Look at that histogram and MACD line SKYROCKET for the last few days! The volume is a bit low today and we're near a price resistance line, which makes me nervous, but considering the bullish nature for the last couple of weeks with no signs of slowing down, I think it's going to break on through! and then, who knows where we'll see the next resistance line!

Hope this impresses the apes. TL;DR: Weeklies: 🚀🚀🚀🚀 , Dailies:   🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Before commenting, they failed to disclose major conflicts of interest. Fuck you Rob Howard, Lon Schneider, and George Perry.***

**EDIT:** What did I tell you my fellow tards? ROB HOWARD had to go out of his way to [respond]( to this shitty DD. **This guy and his sources monitor WALLSTREETBETS for SAVA material.** Hey Rob, you fucking loser. Suck my cock. Your top tweets are about nature photography. Based on your like counts, nobody gives a rats ass about your shitty opinion. Address the CONFLICT OF INTEREST allegations.

This STAT news [article]( by Adam Feurerstein on Cassava Sciences has been discussed previously on r/wallstreetbets in this previous [post](

After reading this article, I started to wonder: ***How easy is it to publish misinformation? Who were these three different scientists doing Alzheimer’s Research?***

So i looked up all three on Google to see how much I could trust them. All had Twitter accounts, with Rob Howard and Lon Schneider being the most active [\[Rob\]]( [\[Lon\]]( [\[George\]](



# Rob Howard - University College London

&gt;*""overblown, inappropriate, and naive. It’s the sort of presentation that one might expect an undergraduate to make.""*

1. Taking a look at his twitter, I can say with confidence that **Rob Howard is an attention-whore**. He [tweets]( negatively and incessantly about potential Alzheimer's treatments. His [first tweet ever]( was bashing Biogen.
2. After years of Biogen bashing, Rob Howard tweeted [\[1\]]( [\[2\]]( [\[3\]]( that **he would be happy to be Chief Investigator on Aducanumab for Biogen** and work for them. After so much shit talking, he STILL had to shoot his shot.
3. Rob Howard is a [trustee]( of Alzheimer’s Research UK. Alzheimer’s Resarch UK [reports]( on its website that they are **working on a competitor to Cassava Science's Simufilam**. The organization plans to hand off “two projects in the final stages of the drug discovery process"" for ""further development by industrial partners."" Both of these experimental drugs work by clearing up a ""build-up of abnormally-folded proteins"" - a similar mechanism to Simufilam. **This is clear evidence of a conflict of interest.**

If this sounds too much of a stretch, Rob Howard himself [puts on a tinfoil hat]( by supporting Adam Feuerstein's allegation that the Alzheimer’s Association is in bed with Biogen.

# Lon Schneider - Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California

&gt;*""uninterpretable""*

1. Similarly to Rob, Lon has built his entire career on the failures of past industry research in Alzheimer's. At the 2017 Alzheimer's Association International Conference, he [presented]( ""A Plethora of Best Targets or Winners' Curses? Unturned Stones and Why Trials Fail."" Much like Rob, **Lon is a professional gay bear in the field of Alzheimer's.**
2. Lon is a subscriber and [fangirl]( of Adam Feurerstein. Both Rob and Lon got hard at the thought of being featured in a Stat news article. Rob and Lon go way back, having authored several shitty opinion papers together.
3. Rob and Lon enjoy working together. One example of their collaboration is [this]( useless opinion article (behind a paywall of course) titled ""The need to show minimum clinically important differences in Alzheimer's disease trials"" which piggybacks off [actual research]( (from industry) to say nothing that hasn't been said before.

# George Perry - University of Texas at San Antonio

&gt;*""These data are interesting, but nothing more at this point...""*

1. George Perry is an [Editor In Chief]( of the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease, **a shit-tier Alzheimer's journal**. They get [6.7 citations on average]( compared to average double digit citations of other journals (11 - 70).
2. George Perry is **personally invested** in [Investacure]( (a fucking investment platform for people who want to buy into potential Alzheimer's cures), [Neurotez]( (a company developing treatment for Alzheimer’s disease), and **Synaptogenix** (formerly [Neurotrope]( a publicly listed company developing treatment for Alzheimer's disease) and is on the advisory board of Nervgen Pharma. **Adam Feurerstein did not disclose this massive conflict of interest in the article.**
3. Perhaps most hilariously, George Perry **wrote his own wikipedia page** (typically frowned upon and a sign of a small pee pee). His [wikipedia page]( reads verbatim compared to the [about page]( linked on his [twitter](

All three have built their success by continuous critique of Alzheimer's research and on the fact that Alzheimer's is one of the hardest diseases to crack. They're getting left behind and they can feel it. If Cassava Sciences succeeds where others have failed, these three will be out of a job. So, they colluded with Stat News writer Adam Feurerstein to bash SAVA, like they have in the past with other Alzheimer's trials. Nothing new, Rob Howard and Lon Schneider have been working with Adam F to discredit industry Alzheimer's research since 2016: [\[1\]]( [\[2\]]( **Haters gonna hate.**

Disclosure: I am retarded and proud of it. I am massively long SAVA and incredibly biased. I believe their science is the best we've ever seen on Alzheimer's. No drug or placebo has ever shown a positive effect on cognition (ADAS-COG) over 9 months.

In August of 2011 during the debt ceiling crisis, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that the federal budget would show a deficit of close to $1.5 trillion, or 9.8 percent of GDP. 

8/1/2021 we are entering a new debt ceiling crisis with congress on a 6 week vacation, combined with an expired rent moratorium where 6.2 million renters face evictions, the homeowners of said tenant's houses will likely never receive back-pay for rent owed possibly causing record high bankruptcies akin to 2008 or worse, and without taking this into account, CBO projects a federal budget deficit of $3.0 trillion this year as the economic disruption caused by the 2020–2021 coronavirus pandemic, while the legislation enacted in response continue to boost the deficit (which was large by historical standards even before the pandemic).

At 13.4 % of gross domestic product (GDP), the deficit in 2021 would be the second largest since 1945, exceeded only by the 14.9 % shortfall recorded in 2020.

For the period of economic expansion from the second quarter of 2009 through the fourth quarter of 2019, real GDP increased at an annual rate of 2.3 %.

For the period of economic expansion from the second quarter of 2020 through the first quarter of 2021, real GDP increased at an annual rate of 14.1 %.

Which in my opinion and as shown below by these reports is due to the insanely high level of newly printed money and covid stimulus payments.



CBO estimates from 2011 would be heaven in comparison to the reality we're facing, which is a crippled economy, and stock market on the verge of collapse. Evident as follows;

In 2011 CBO projected the 3 month Treasury bill to be worth 4.4% in 2021.

The actual 3 month Treasury bill rate for July 2021 is worth between 0.01 and 0.06%.

In 2011 the projected 10 year Treasury note bill rate was projected to be 5.4% for 2021

The actual 10 year Treasury note bill rate is 1.24% In July 2021



Part 2 of 4

7/29/2021 Report Released by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Beureau of Economic Analysis, on the Gross Domestic Product, Second Quarter 2021

A report by the Beureau of Economic Analysis, BEA, shows that the 2nd quarter of 2021 has been a bloodbath in terms of loss of income, savings, and increased expenses for the average American.

Personal Income: ""Current-dollar personal income decreased $1.32 trillion in the second quarter, or 22.0 percent, in contrast to an increase of $2.33 trillion (revised), or 56.8 percent, in the first quarter of 2021."" -

This means that income literally was cut by nearly 22% on average in 2nd quarter of 2021.

Disposable personal income decreased $1.42 trillion, or 26.1 percent, in the second quarter, in contrast to an increase of $2.27 trillion, or 63.7 percent (revised), in the first quarter. - Again all fake gains thru the stimmy.

Real disposable personal income decreased 30.6 percent in Q2, in contrast to an increase of 57.6 percent in Q1. - and again Trump &amp; Biden Bucks.

This means that (money considered as non-essential, 🙄) decreased by over $890 billion for Americans in Q2 of 2021 alone.

AT THE SAME TIME, Personal outlays (expenses) increased $680.8 billion in Q2, after increasing $538.8 billion for Q1. - This means that expenses have increased by $150+ Billion in average from Q1 2021 to Q2 2021 for Americans! Can you say inflation?

Personal savings was $1.97 trillion in the second quarter, compared with $4.07 trillion (revised) in the first quarter of 2021

The personal saving rate—personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income—was DOWN 10.9 percent in the second quarter, which was already DOWN 20.8 percent in the first quarter.

This means Americans have lost $3 TRILLION in savings Q2 2021 ALONE.

Where does it go? Banks and lenders?

Inflation seems to be the only thing that's going up this quarter.

""The price index for gross domestic purchases increased 5.7 percent in the second quarter, compared with an increase of 3.9 percent (revised) in the first quarter...   The PCE price index increased 6.4 percent, compared with an increase of 3.8 percent in the 1st quarter.



5/1/2021 Report Released by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, on GDP and the Economy for Q1 2021

The acceleration in real GDP growth reflects artificial economic strength.

The GDP is primarily based in the continued economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic as government assistance payments were distributed to households and businesses. An acceleration in consumer spending and upturns in federal as well as state and local government spending more than accounted for the acceleration in real GDP.

These were partly offset by downturns in private inventory investment and exports and by decelerations in residential fixed investment and nonresidential fixed investment. Imports slowed.

The US Economy by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis says;

""The acceleration in consumer spending reflected an upturn in spending on goods and an acceleration in spending on services.

Within goods, all components of both durable and nondurable goods contributed to the upturn. The leading contributors were upturns in spending on motor vehicles and parts as well as on food and beverages purchased for off-premises consumption.

Within services, the leading contributors to the acceleration were upturns in spending on food services and accommodations and on transportation services.

An upturn in federal government spending was the second largest contributor to the acceleration in real GDP. The upturn primarily reflected an upturn in nondefense spending on intermediate goods and services purchased by government. In the first quarter, the processing and administration of Paycheck Protection Program loan applications by banks on behalf of the federal government added approximately $13.2 billion ($52.6 billion at an annual rate) to nondefense services. Federal government purchases of COVID-19 vaccines for distribution to the public contributed to the upturn in nondefense goods.

The upturn in state and local government spending reflected an upturn in consumption expenditures, led by compensation of employees, that was partly offset by a downturn in gross investment, led by a downturn in structures.

The downturn in private inventory investment was led by a larger decrease in retail trade and a downturn in manufacturing. Within retail trade, the largest contributor was a larger decrease in inventory investment by motor vehicle dealers. Within manufacturing, there were downturns in both durable and nondurable goods manufacturing inventory investment.

The downturn in exports reflected downturns in both goods (led by a deceleration in industrial supplies and a downturn in foods, feeds, and beverages) and services (led by a deceleration in transport and a downturn in royalties and license fees).

Residential fixed investment slowed, largely reflecting a slowdown in new residential structures, notably single-family units, and a downturn in brokers' commissions.

Nonresidential fixed investment slowed, reflecting a slowdown in investment in equipment that was partly offset by a smaller decrease in investment in structures. Investment in intellectual property products grew at about the same rate as in the fourth quarter.

The slowdown in equipment investment was more than accounted for by a slowdown in transportation equipment that was partly offset by an acceleration in information processing equipment.

The smaller decrease in structures was more than accounted for by a smaller decrease in investment in industrial structures.

Imports slowed. As a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, imports contributed to the acceleration in first-quarter GDP. The main contributor was a downturn in automotive vehicles, engines, and parts""

July 21, 2021 CBO released report:

""Additional Information About the Updated Budget and Economic Outlook: 2021 to 2031""

""As the pandemic eases and demand for consumer services surges, real (inflation-adjusted) GDP in CBO’s projections grows by 7.4 percent this year and surpasses its potential (maximum sustainable) level by the end of the year.""

A.K.A a market crash is insinuated by CBO and they directly state that the GDP of this nation surpassing maximum sustainability!



Meanwhile, CBO claims unemployment will decrease....

""Employment grows quickly in the second half of 2021 in CBO’s projections and surpasses its prepandemic level in mid-2022. Inflation rises in 2021 to its highest rate since 2008 as increases in the supply of goods and services lag behind increases in the demand for them. By 2022, supply adjusts more quickly, and inflation falls but remains above its prepandemic rate through 2025. As the economy continues to expand over the forecast period, the interest rate on 10-year Treasury notes rises, reaching 2.7 percent in 2025 and 3.5 percent in 2031—still low by historical standards.""

But unemployment hasn't decreased at all.

7/21/2021 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released report states, ""The national unemployment rate, 5.9 percent, was little changed over the month""

Part 3 of 4

The Debt Ceiling Dillema

""A two-year deal to suspend the debt ceiling lapsed at midnight (7/31/21) following inaction from Congress and President Biden to give the U.S. more borrowing authority. The Treasury Department will now begin taking what it refers to as ""extraordinary measures"" to prevent the U.S. from defaulting on its debt.""

""Republican leaders have told Democrats that there can be no bipartisan debt ceiling agreement without a slate of debt reduction measures targeting the roughly $28 trillion national debt. Several GOP lawmakers have floated a deal similar to the 2011 Budget Control Act, which ended a debt ceiling standoff shortly before the U.S. suffered its first ever credit downgrade.""

CBO says, ""the Treasury would probably run out of cash sometime in the first quarter of the next fiscal year (which begins on October 1, 2021, most likely in October or November, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. If that occurred, the government would be unable to pay its obligations fully, and it would delay making payments for its activities, default on its debt obligations, or both.

The timing and size of revenue collections and outlays over the coming months could differ noticeably from CBO's projections. Therefore, the extraordinary measures could be exhausted, and the Treasury could run out of cash, either earlier or later than CBO projects.

Yellen has also said uncertainty driven by the coronavirus pandemic and the federal government's fiscal response has made it harder to pin down exactly how long the U.S. to avoid a default.""

Yellen stated that the default could happen as soon as early September.

This means we could see the US Treasury's ability to pay almost all bills completely crippled well before or after Congress' return to duty as they just began a 6 week vacation on 7/31/21.





Our GDP is a complete farce that was being held up by stimulus payments, government covid spending, Repurchase/Reverse Repurchase Agreements of Treasury Bills to the tune of now over $1 Trillion per day, imports and exports are down huge while sea ports are more severely congested than ever before as are airline cargo carriers. Mortgage applications, sales, and broker commissions are down heavily, trucking rates are at all time highs with minimal availability especially for ocean and rail drayage, warehouse storage for said freight is at maximum capacity with available space at all time lows &amp; prices at all time highs due to supply and demand, retail trade and manufacturing are down significantly as well in Q2. Consumer spending is down as well as savings to lows not seen in many years as well.

Essentially the bubble from stimulus has already been popped. It's only a short matter of time before we see the effects on our country and it will be reflected on the stock market first and foremost as it is already being seen by the banks unwillingness to invest in long term stocks/bonds/treasuries using the record high $1 Trillion per day Repurchase / Reverse Program to prevent the dollar and market from collapsing together.



A 2015 report from the Government Accountability Office analyzing the 2013 debt ceiling standoff found that ""investors reported taking the unprecedented action of systematically avoiding certain Treasury securities,"" which are considered almost as safe as cash, causing widespread issues across credit markets.

""Industry groups emphasized that even a temporary delay in payment could undermine confidence in the full faith and credit of the United States and therefore cause significant damage to markets for Treasury securities and other assets,"" the report said.

The last 2 times the debt ceiling crisis occurred in 2011 and 2013, rating agencies to re-evaluate the rating of US government debt.

On October 15 2013, Fitch Ratings placed the United States under a ""Rating watch negative"" in response to the crisis.

On October 17 2013, Dagong Global Credit Rating downgraded the United States from A to A−, and maintained a negative outlook on the country's credit.

In 2013 while lawmakers and the Obama Administration came to an agreement on the debt ceiling, from September 19th to October 9th, the S&amp;P 500 moved below its 50 day moving average and the SPY lost 5.2%.

On 8/9/2011 during the Debt Ceiling Crisis The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 634.76 points as approximately $2.5 TRILLION was erased from global equities.

That's $2,500,000,000,000.00 in one day.

The S&amp;P 500 Index lost 6.7 percent to 1,119.46, its lowest level since September, as all 500 stocks fell for the first time since Bloomberg began tracking the data in 1996.

7/30/21 -Federal Reserve announced commercial bank asset and LIABILITY numbers release H8

The Liabilities have grown big time since last year.

Federal Reserve released COMMERCIAL BANK ASSET &amp; LIABILITIES numbers for July 2021 and year over year losses have increased tremendously in the tens of trillions of dollars, a large majority of this is based on derivatives, options calls/puts, mortgage back securities, swaps of all kinds, rehypothecated shares, naked shorts, synthetic shares up the ass... See screenshot for explanation of subsection 22 losses description.



All of the 11 Tables provided shows an increase of losses.

The only table pictured is TABLE 2 showing an increase of $1.54 Trillion in unrealized losses in the form of derivatives, securities, swaps, etc...

On Table 2 (of 11) alone, their RESIDUAL Assets (less liabilities) &lt;minus expenses&gt; increased only $40 Billion compared to the $1.54 Trillion increase in losses.

So even though they had huge increases in revenue (covid stimulus), the net gain was hugely diminished by the losses in these sectors.

6/28/2021

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency released report stated that 4 large banks held 89 percent of the total banking industry notional amount of derivatives, a total of 1,385 insured U.S. commercial banks and savings associations held derivatives at the end of first quarter 2021.

Additionally,

derivative contracts remained concentrated in interest rate products, which represented 72.7 percent of total derivative notional amounts.

the percentage of centrally cleared derivatives transactions increased quarter-over-quarter to 38.2 percent in first quarter 2021.



In 2011, gridlocked House Republicans and the Obama White House came within days of a drop-dead default over the debt ceiling. The S&amp;P 500 fell for five days in a row leading up to the weekend that lawmakers finally struck a deal. Over 4% of the entire stock market was lost in those 5 days.

But only 4% of the hog operations currently can comply. According to one farmer, to meet the new standard, he needs 3 million for the upgrade to raise just 250 hogs. Restaurants owners are worried because bacon is one of the most popular breakfast items and bacon helped their business survive the pandemic. ([  People love bacon from all backgrounds. ""You know, I work and live with a lot of Asian and Hispanic populations in the city and their diet consists of pork bacon. Pork bacon is huge,"" Kim said. ""It’s almost like bread and butter.""

Bacon love is ingrained into our soul and genetics and therefore an inelastic demand. A small change in bacon supply can lead to a drastic change in price, as explained by graph below.

[Inelastic Demand Price Action](

According to consulting firm Hitamiya Group, if half of the pork supply was lost, bacon price would jump 60% which means a $6 package could rise to $9.60 cents ([ If 90% - 95% of the supplies are gone, the fair price should be at least 2.5 times the current market value. And that means **1 package of bacon is $15 per package.**

You must wonder, how do I profit from this? A very ancient trade technique - BUY LOW SELL HIGH

I am not talking about buying 10 packs of bacon from Costco and resale them later. I am talking about doing it at scale. Go big or go home.

**Step 1 - Install Freezers in Your Garage**

Let’s figure out how many freezers you can potentially have. First park your cars on the street and empty the garage. The average garage size is 12 feet \* 22 feet \* 8 feet. So 12 \* 22 \* 8 = 2112 cubic feet.

The below fridge dimension is 37.25 x 20.75 x 33.25 inches and can storage up to 7 cubic feet items.

[ Ideal Fridge to Keep Bacon](

Let’s do more math to see how many fridges your garage can potentially store.

2112 (volume of garage) \* 1728 (1 cubic feet is 1728 cubic inch) / 37.25 \* 20.75 \* 33.25 (volume of fridge) = **142 fridges**

Obviously you can’t just stack all of those fridges in the garage. Let’s say we can achieve 80% of that. And that means you can have around **110 fridges.**

Remember to use Amazon FREE SHIPPING. Very important to save cost.

**Fridge Cost with Tax**: 110 \* 229 \* 1.1 (Uncle Sam wants the tax) = **$27709**

|**Item**|Cost|
|:-|:-|
|110 Fridges|$27709|

**Step 2 - Buy Bacon in Bulk and use FREE SHIPPING**

According to USDA ([ one package (1 pound) of bacon in  June 2021 is about $6.67. We can get this much lower by buying from Costco in BULK. As you can see below, **our one package cost is $4.53** AFTER tax including delivery. Again, very important to use free shipping to save cost.

[Bacon Price From Costco](

It's time to calculate how much to buy. The size of one package of bacon is about 10 inch \* 4 inch \* 1 inch so 40 cubic inch. And the volume of our fridge is 7 cubic feet which is 12096 cubic inch. So one fridge can store around 300 packages or pounds of bacon. With 110 fridges, we can store 33000 packages or pounds of bacon. Each pound of bacon is $4.53, so the total cost of bacon is $149,490

Total Cost So Far

|**Item**|Cost|
|:-|:-|
|110 Fridges|$27709|
|33000 packages or 2200 cases of bacon|$149,490|

**Step 3 - Factor In the Electricity Cost**

Running 110 freezers in the garage is apparently very energy consuming and electricity is expensive in California, at about 20 cents / kWh.

The freezer is 150 watts so running 110 freezers for let's say 6 months will cost $14256. You can check my math below:

150 watts \* 6 (month) \* 30 (days) \* 24 (hours) / 1000 = 648 kWh (one fridge running a year energy consumption)

648 kWh \* 0.2 cents / kWh \* 110 = $14256

Total Cost So Far

|**Item**|Cost|
|:-|:-|
|110 Fridges|$27709|
|33000 packages or 2200 cases of bacon|$149,490|
|Electricity|$14256|

Step 4 - Sell High And Take Profits

Don't diamond hand bacon, you are in 2022 and it's time to sell for a profit!

The cost of bacon per package factoring in everything so far is **$5.8.** And we unload each package for $15. So that means each package profit is $9.2.

# The total profit is $9.2 * 33000 = $303,600

If you too lazy to contact customers or answer phone calls yourself, just hire someone for like 20K a month to the work for you. I expect the inventory goes to zero in a month so at the end of the day, you pocket close to $280,000 profits.

And you can figure out the tax part and probably can resell those freezers for half the price.

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 1. The Great Woodening**

Cathie's Ark funds have been around for a while now. I know, I lost money on several of them back before she blew up. Keep this little tidbit in mind as you read on, as there are few things as effective at coloring one's views as the bitterness of missing the boat.

Over the past few years, Cathie blew up on the spot. So much so, that she gave birth to entire youtuber carriers. These guys just put on 'youtube face' for the thumbnail, add a title like 'What Cathie JUST bought!' (always important to all-cap the 'just'), and then they read out information you could've just gotten by signing up for her trade notifications yourself.

So how did this come to be? How did this random lady with a questionable investment fund portfolio get dubbed '**the money tree**' by the Koreans?

Answer: She's a fantastic salesperson with accesses to the **full** range of media in order to execute her pumping strategy. And... she bought Tesla. And then pumped the absolute shit out that motherfucker.

You see, her pumping strategy is ***several orders of magnitude*** better than anything you'll ever see here, because she backs her pumps up with next level YOLOs. In order for one of you ~~retards~~ *distinguished investors* to even approach her level, you need the best DD known to man ***and*** you need to follow that post up with a YOLO post were you bought ***tens of millions*** of dollars worth of the stock. And even then, you'd fall horribly short of what this lady can do.

Does this mean I think she's a scam artist? No. Is she running a game? Aren't we all? But I'll get to that more in Part 6. On to the Charts of Fury!

&amp;#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 2. A Wooden Albatross**

The greatest decision Cathie Wood ever made was to buy Tesla and pump it harder than any stock has been pumped in the history of pumping. I haven't investigated her past enough to know whether she was captain of the cheerleading squad, but good lord, she *should've been*.

The current state of TSLA:

[Elon's back on track](

A couple of important points about this chart. First, it's still over that green uptrend line, which is decidedly bullish. Second, it broke out of the orange downtrend line. Again, bullish. The only worry I have is that there is a sideways channel forming. However, this uncertainty should resolve itself by the end of this month (August) at the latest.

&amp;#x200B;

Before shitting all over TSLA, let's first compare it to ARKK:

[Should've just bought TSLA](

Here we can see that Cathie is under performing her own major holding. And TSLA is far and away her largest holding (some of the other big ones are down below). She holds TLSA as her number one holding in ARKK, ARKW **and** ARKQ (over 10% in all three). If you wanted to outperform Cathie Wood, all you had to do was just buy TSLA yourself. (The percent difference *down* from the top is nearly the same, however, TSLA is *up* 400% from the same point versus her 150%). Why pay her to do it for you? To be fair, she does have other stuff and it's not all bad. However, I named this section the Wooden Albatross because her position here is so large that **as Tesla goes, Cathie goes**.

Which brings me to the problem with Tesla: ***competition***. Tesla was a great investment. Elon got out front of everyone with EVs, proved the doubters wrong, and has reaped outsized rewards for it. But the competition is coming for him. It might not be this year, or even the next, but Tesla ***is going to bleed***. Mark my words, it is going to happen.

With excellent earnings, Tesla is bringing that stratospheric p/e of over 1,000 in 2020 down to something more '*reasonable*' of \~230 for this year, and by 2022 to \~130. That's great. **However**, in order to keep up, Elon is going to need to keep smashing out of the park again and again and again and again and.... You get the point. One miss and this puppy is going for a ride down blood bath mountain.

Still, the chart says up, and I'm by no means bold enough to call the top on Tesla. Tread carefully, friends.

&amp;#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 3. Back to the Future**

If Cathie is known for anything (other than buying Tesla) it's what I like to call 'Cathie Woodisms.' This is a whole universe of new age buzzwordology such as: innovator, disruptor, AI, machine learning, next-gen, etc. Now, I've pointed and laughed at this shit on a fair number of occasions here on the sub. But I also wrote [this post]( where I made the case that this shit will underpin what I've dubbed **M.A.Rs** **- the Mother of All Rallies**.

Now, what at first blush looks utterly inconsistent, after the application of contorted logic becomes totally consistent! These buzzwords are, ***for the most part***, bullshit and just slapped on any old thing in order to make the pump sound better. However, there are some cases where I think these appellations are more than just sound bites, but represent something truly new. So let's look at some of Cathie's investments that meet that criteria (at least in my eyes).

First, and probably the best, CRSP:

[Not a great chart, but I want that third arm](

The CRISPR gene editing tool is most next level shit that exists today. Sure, the present applications are limited and for the foreseeable future this will be constrained to dealing with genetic disorders (which should bring hope to you all). The potential of this, however, is truly mind bending. You could no longer be a manlet, for example. You could no longer have to suffer having a woman laugh at you when she sees how small your penis is and ask, ""Is that *really* it? I guess I get to sleep through this session..."" I get to have my 20-year-old hairline back. ***Possibilities***.

If this leads where I'm thinking it leads, then we are in for borderline miracles here, people. Now, just because *this* company has CRISPR in the name, does not mean it will end up being the Chosen One. But for now, let's just say it is. If you're looking for an entry, this is kinda, sorta settling into a channel and is at the bottom of that. If you're a ***believer***, TA doesn't matter; buy it at any price. I regret not picking it up at that dip under a $100.

&amp;#x200B;

Next up, the embodiment of evil, PLTR:

[The Eye of Darkness sees .... a 'maybe' uptrend](

Palantir is difficult to wrap your mind around, but basically they do AI shit, specifically data analytics. While this seems ho-hum, I'm told that it is in fact the precursor to ushering in Big Brother and giving **all the power** to our Totalitarian Corporate Globalist Overlords. Which both gives me a hard on and makes me want to buy the stock. I mean who wants to be on the team with the tiny little hobbits when you can be on the team with the hundred-story high flaming eyeball? Have you guys seen how the Globalist Overlords live? I have it on good authority its just like the rich asshole bad guys in every Gundam series. Man that looks awesome.

As for the chart, it's finding its way into a channel, but there's also support trend line underneath us right now. I think it's a buy at these prices, personally. Though I haven't actually bought it, so you know.... Like CRSP, I think Cathie is right on this one and it's a good ***long*** hold.

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's look at something Cathie was absolutely fucking ***wrong*** on, WKHS:

[Dead-ish Horse](

This is my third time talking shit about this ticker so I'll keep it brief: **I don't like it**. Nothing they do impresses me. The problem is that anything they do, someone else does better. Drones? Amazon. EVs? Tesla. They are so unimpressive that even Cathie bailed on them, as she no longer holds any shares of this amazing buyout opportunity of a company.

From the chart, again I'm seeing a potential channel forming, which is *amazing* news for the bagholders.

&amp;#x200B;

Next, and because I'm a whore for karma, HOOD:

[What TA!](

Okay, this is basically a joke chart. Doing TA on a ticker two days on the market is like deciding to marry that kinda chubby girl on your second date because she promised she was working real hard to slim down. And now you have special van to carry her around and can't own a house with more than one story. I'd say more about HOOD, but I don't want to incur the wrath of the **Titans of Wall Street**.

&amp;#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 4. Hardwood Flooring**

Under girding Cathie's ~~degenerate gambling~~ *wise, forward thinking investments* are some pretty solid companies. Indeed, there are too many to cover here, but to give you an idea: **she owns John Deere in her space fund ARKX**. (And her robotics fund, though it makes more sense there as Deere is likely moving toward self-driving tillage equipment). She also owns all kinds of other 'boomer' stuff (e.g., GOOG, AMZN, etc.), so I'm going to limit this part to the other three of her top holdings in ARKK after TSLA.

&amp;#x200B;

First, the second major holding, TDOC:

[That whole re-opening thing in chart form](

So this tele-medicine company has performed as expected after the lockdowns ended: *poorly*. In addition to ARKK (2nd largest position), she owns this in ARKW (#3), ARKG (#1, to be expected), and ARKF (#15). She sure likes this stock. I don't know all the much about it, but its recent under performance is certainly dragging her down given its position among her family of funds.

From the chart, we have a pretty clear downtrend channel. The sliver of hope would be the support line I drew, but it's way too early to call the bottom here. I'll not be buying this at these prices (or ever, if I'm being honest).

&amp;#x200B;

Next, something people around here actually know about, ROKU:

[Nice chart, 9\/10, would fuck](

I'm seething with regret that I passed on this ticker ***several times*** back in 2019. Cathie's not, though. This is one of her better performers, if not the best given it's #3 position in ARKK. I still don't like the company because I don't see how they're going to beat out Amazon, Netflix, etc. But given how horribly wrong I've been thus far, you should definitely not listen to me.

But if you wanted to listen to the chart, you'd wait for a retrace to the uptrend line. The ticker might not give you that, though. With that double top, however, I think more likely than not, *it will*.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, some fin-tech magic, SQ:

[The definition of showing up after the party's over](

I never even heard of this until it was way too fucking late to buy it, so again Captain Sour Grapes has little good to say about it. I do understand what they do, because my nephew works at a restaurant that uses their app for payments. There are others in this space, but the chart says people like Square's chances and I'm not going to argue with that.

On the other hand, we're clearly out of the channel and there is no hope of recovering **that** channel. In keeping with Cbass's top notch TA skills, I eyeballed a rough sideways channel, but just going straight the fuck up from here is just as likely. (Probably in a new parallel channel). Still, this has the shape and feel of a typical big-tech chart: run up, pause for hot sideways action, then resume the run up. I'll not be buying it, I think, but y'all have fun with it anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 5. Cathie &amp; the Chairman**

Cathie's been in the news lately for dumping her Chinese positions. She's certainly not alone in this and if you take the general pulse of investors vis-a-vis China it's.... let's just say ***not good***. I'm going to constrain myself to just her positions, rather than pile on this orgy of 'go fuck yourself.'

First off, she's fully out of Tencent (she dumped the last on Friday, but it's not yet reflected in the holding lists on her website). I won't show the chart because this ticker is on OTC, so I think that's a no-no 'round these parts. There's some other shit she's selling too, but ~~nobody's ever~~ *I've* *never* heard of it.

One of her larger positions that she's still unloading is JD:

[Maybe Xi destroys you, maybe he doesn't... it depends on how his breakfast was](

JD is an online sales company like Alibaba or Amazon. It's #2 in China, I believe. I haven't heard any bad news specific to this company, but the general crackdown has hit the whole sector, no exceptions. The chart gives you a maybe-channel to work with if you've got the testicular fortitude for this kind of gambling. It is $10/share back to the top of that channel.... Or a complete breakdown a couple weeks from now when news breaks that the entire board of directors got sent to a gulag.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't seen any news of her unloading the magic carpet, BABA:

[This looks FINE! \(Weekly candles\)](

But it sure is unloading on her, right in the face. Fuck me, this is a nasty chart. You can tinker around with that downward channel all you like and it's never gonna look like anything other than you losing more money.  The $180 mark is your beacon of hope, because after that I don't see all that much in the way of a slide all the way to $130.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's take a look at the daily chart, just for fun:

[Yep, still looks bad](

You see, by making this chart that doesn't show anything under $170, that means the price ***cannot go under $170***. This is because charts are magic spells that you cast on the ticker. Try it out next time you're losing all your money!

&amp;#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 6. Romancing the Wood**

Looking at her recent under performance, one must inevitably ask: Has Cathie Wood lost her touch? Or perhaps: Was it nothing but luck all along? There's no easy answer here.

Without a doubt a cult of personality has risen up around Cathie and that has helped her outperform, as hordes of retail investors decided to buy into whatever she was buying into. Indeed, ***this very processes*** appears to be part of her strategy: i.e., she buys a new, 'innovative' company, goes on CNBC to talk about, then all the youtubers make videos about it and the subs dedicated to her start talking about it, and boom, just like that she sent the ticker to the moon.

Despite this, I don't think she just some charlatan. Some of her choices are questionable, certainly, but others indicate to me that she is doing exactly what she claims: investing in the companies of tomorrow. It is simply that she, like any human being, can be wrong. And sometimes, *horribly wrong*.

I'm not going to make a snide comment about how she came to her idea for these types of investment funds. The younger version of Cbass wore that cloak of sneering superiority, and doffing it was one of the better character choices I've ever made. Perhaps the only good one. People like to snicker when someone describes their epiphany in religious terms, forgetting that every human until these most recent times did exactly that whenever an idea came to them.  I'll say no more.

As for whether her idea will work out for her, that has yet to be decided. As I've seen others here note, she appears to be trying to play catch-up, afraid that her recent slips will trigger a rush to the gates causing the collapse of her whole endeavor. This is a real danger for her, but doubling down like a degenerate gambler at 5:00 am in the casino is probably the wrong call. To that point, I'm actually happy to see her selling, even for a loss. For a while there, it looked like she was going to just keep buying into failing positions, hoping her very act of buying would be the thing that re-ignited the play.

Now, our old buddy Jim Cramer sure does like to talk about Mrs. Wood. Some have called him all sorts of names for his seeming obsession with her, but I rather think he saw what she was doing with her purchase-and-pump routine and it *irked* him. This is his game, too, but in Cramer's mind he only pumps 'responsible' plays, while Cathie is pumping crap.

Or maybe Jim was just trying to Romance the Wood:

Hope everyone has enjoyed their summer more than I have, working two jobs right now so I can buy more shares of $BB. Let's get down to business.

Daily chart (USD)



Currently about to reach a triple bottom in the $9.80 USD range. This line of support has long been used even before the reddit rally late January, going as far back as 2013. A triple bottom can act as a strong foundation to the upside.  
That being said, it is possible we see the $8.30 range. This is the current possible \~15-20% downside of the current price and in my eyes, the absolute bottom.

Why is it the bottom?



&amp;#x200B;

This is the positions cost distribution of $BB taken from WeBulls. Its not a perfect measure, but it allows us to see where the majority of people are positioned right now. If people are holding the bag at \~15.00, than at this point they may as well keep holding.

Triple bottom - Strong sign of support in the $9.80 area. Selling pressure has dropped. Getting close to breaking that downward channel. If $9.80 holds over the next few days that means that a longer bull trend has formed by producing ""higher-lows"".

&amp;#x200B;



This is a weekly chart, its looking like we are forming a wedge. RSI remains healthy on the weekly. Bollinger bands are also looking flat/even.

&amp;#x200B;



(Daily) Bollinger bands are starting to move horizontally on the bottom band, showing that we may finally be breaking out of this downward channel and may continue to stay in the $9.80 range.  
RSI looking low-ish but moderately healthy.

&amp;#x200B;



The 4-hour chart shows $BB bollinger bands are horizontal, meaning the price has stabilized. Another reason why I believe we may currently be at the bottom and ready for the next run up.

Saw a rejection of the uptrend on Wednesday, perfectly played into the channel. We should be seeing another test of breaking the channel this week.

Volume is drying up, although after Wednesday's pop a lot of purchasing in the $10 range is a good sign. Anything under $10 is a buy imo.

What I would like to see is on more test at $9.80 and bounce up possibly on Wednesday or Thursday, and continue to run flat for the rest of the week. This would show strength and is an absolute buy.

If $9.80 does not fall and we do not test the $8.30 range, this will be an overall bull-case for $BB and we are likely to never see $BB in the single digits ever again after the next run up.

If $9.80 does fall into the $8.30 range, well congratulations, you have a buy there too. Anything under $10 is a screaming buy for $BB with its current news dependent situation.

Where do I believe that we'll run up to?  
When BB breaks out in the next two weeks, it should be around a 50%+ pop over a course of a few days. As in my previous posts, $14.50 is the heaviest line of significance/line of resistance. It also coincides with where most of the bag holders are funny enough, so there will be strong selling pressure for some to get their money back.  
$14.50 is also roughly where my wedge lands over the next few weeks.  
If $14.50 is blown past then we are out of the trend and its up to the market to decide where it goes.

Overall, I believe that in the current prices that there is a maximum 20% downside, and at worst \~50% upside over the course of the next two to three weeks. A great play for traders or those of you that want to/need to average down.

DYODD. I'm not a financial investor.  
\~Currently own 2200 shares of $BB, and have been buying \~100 shares every week it hovers under/around $10.","$BB Stock Price - 15-20% downside, 50%+ upside potential in 2-4 weeks.",1052,6

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**]( Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&amp;nbsp;

- **Wednesday AH has a load favorable trades.** $ROKU, $FSLY, $ETSY, $LMND, $BNGO all have an average move of over 10%, and are all set to report on Wednesday. If you’re looking to gamble, I would personally roll the dice on one of these companies since they have the highest likelihood of providing us with a profitable moonshot which will greatly offset the IV crush we’ll experience. Since they’re reporting Wednesday after hours, the options for them will be *incredibly cheap* because they will only have one day left before they expire, and theta will have made them close to worthless. **Cheap options, huge potential moves.** What’s there not to love? The best part is, many of these options are priced inefficiently. At the time of writing, $ROKU has a projected move of 8% but often moves double that. The same goes for $FSLY. These ratios will only get better for us throughout the week as theta does its thing. I’ll likely throw on a couple of straddles right before close on Wednesday.

&amp;nbsp;

- **$LYFT and $UBER provide us with a collateral play opportunity.**  Pretty straightforward play this time around - if you’re bullish or bearish on either company, you should look to enter an $UBER position BEFORE $LYFT reports earnings on Tuesday. The $LFYT report will likely move both $LYFT and $UBER equally. If we play $LYFT, we run the risk of getting IV crushed, or having a move go against us. If we play $UBER, we’ll reap the rewards if we are right, while also avoiding IV crush. Furthermore, if the move goes against us, IV will inflate, offsetting any potential losses we may experience. **You could also look to do the same with $PENN and $DKNG.** This was just a crude summary, if you wish to learn more about this type of trade, check out my writeup on collateral plays [**here.**](

&amp;nbsp;

- **Avoid $BABA and $NKLA like the plague.** Both companies are getting hammered due to outside circumstances, meaning that earnings will have very little to no impact on their overall stock prices. $BABA is getting smacked around by the Chinese government, and $NKLA is facing round 8 or 9 of fraud charges. I have no stake in either company, nor do I ever plan to, but I know some idiots will inevitably try buying the dip thinking they’re Warren Buffet. Do not play $NKLA or $BABA this week.

&amp;nbsp;

All that being said, I haven’t had much time to review any extra trades given that I’ve been extremely busy this weekend. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.

#Summary and Conclusion

We’ve got a wild week ahead! Lots of large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap companies across many different sectors are set to report, meaning we’ve got some huge opportunities to generate some serious alpha. If you see any appealing plays I’ve missed, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet]( to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment!

# Introduction

The Federal Reserve has three primary tools to conduct Monetary Policy: reserve requirements, the discount rate, and open market operations (Quantitative Easing). Open market operations is how the Fed uses its balance sheet to provide liquidity to the market. More details can be found [here]( The Fed defines Open Market Operations as:

*Open market operations involve the buying and selling of government securities. The term “open market” means that the Fed doesn’t decide on its own which securities dealers it will do business with on a particular day. Rather, the choice emerges from an “open market” in which the various securities dealers that the Fed does business with – the primary dealers – compete on the basis of price. Open market operations are flexible, and thus, the most frequently used tool of monetary policy.*

This is a fancy way of saying the Fed prints money to buy up US debt, providing liquidity while also keeping interest rates low. Essentially, Quantitative Easing (QE) is debt monetization. This analysis explores the changes in the Fed balance sheet to better understand what the Fed is buying and when.

# Recent Trends

The latest balance sheet figures show the total at 8.22T, up 143B from the prior month end, but down in the past week by 19B. The chart below shows how the Fed Balance sheet has grown by instrument over the last 18 months. The major surge from COVID can be clearly seen as 2.5T was added within 2 months. The monthly changes since reflect QE on autopilot. Autopilot targets about 120B in monthly purchases split by 40B in MBS and 80B in US Treasuries. As the numbers show, this is not exact, but an approximation.

The “Other” category surged and fell last year due to Repurchase Agreements. This is the opposite of the Reverse Repos. In standard Repo Agreements, the Fed buys from a dealer with an agreement to return the security. This was designed to be temporary in nature rather than a permanent add to the balance sheet. These repurchase agreements put a floor under the treasury market by providing unlimited liquidity.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 1: Monthly Change by Instrument](

 

The table below shows the breakdown of holdings by instrument and the period over period change as indicated. The main takeaways:

* The balance sheet has grown by 1.27B over the last year, averaging about 100B a month rather than the target of 120B
   * More recent months are trending above this average and target
* The balance sheet grew by $4T over 3 years, the majority of which occurred since the start of Covid
* In the latest month, the focus has been on MBS(65B) and Shorter term treasuries of 1-5 years (39B)
* The Fed is not putting much emphasis on short term debt adding only 63B over 1 year
   * The market for short term treasuries is still very liquid and does not need Fed support
   * Almost 40% of the Treasury Balance sits in 1-5 year maturing debt with another 40% in 5+
* MBS has grown by 451B over the last year and Treasuries have grown almost 1T

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 2: Balance Sheet Breakdown](

 The chart below shows the percent distribution by product. While absolute values have increased quite significantly as shown in the table above, the distribution of holdings has changed some. MBS made up 40% of the balance sheet 3 years ago, but the number has fallen to under 30% as short term (&lt;1 year) and medium term (5-10 years) has increased from 9% to 12.6% and 7% to 11.7% respectively. 

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 3: Total Debt Outstanding ](

#  ZOOMING INTO WEEKLY

Another chart to look at is the weekly change in the balance sheet. Anyone who follows the balance sheet closely, will notice it dips once a month before jumping back up. The chart below shows how the fed balance sheet changes week over week. As seen, there are a few consistent trends:

* A series of MBS Mature about every four weeks  

   * This results in a slight decrease in the balance sheet for that week
* A bulk of MBS is also bought every 4 weeks that is larger then the maturing MBS  

   * This creates a surge in the balance sheet for that week
* Treasury securities mature and are purchased with less volatility

The latest week saw 37B in MBS mature with 20B in Treasuries purchased. It is likely that in 2 weeks there will be a large purchase of MBS.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 4: Fed Balance Sheet Weekly Changes](

 

The table below shows how the latest week compares to the weekly averages over 4, 24, 52, and 156 (3 years) weeks. The weekly averages are shown to gauge whether the current periods (1 and 4 weeks) are accelerating or decelerating. The averages are all divisible by 4 because that is about how many weeks a full cycle takes as shown in the plot above.

The Fed has averaged about 35B per week for 4 weeks totaling 140B, which is slightly above the 120B monthly target. The latest week saw a more than 50% increase in debt maturing in 1-5 years compared to the 4, 24, and 52 week averages. Perhaps this helped drive the 2-year rate from 25bps back to 20bps over the last two weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 5: Average Weekly Change in the Balance Sheet](

#  Historical Perspective

As mentioned, the Fed is monetizing US Debt. The chart below uses the data from the [debt analysis]( and matches it up with the Fed balance sheet holdings. While this is not a perfect one to one match due to the nature of reporting, the outcome can be seen below. This chart focuses specifically on Treasury securities: Bills (&lt;1 Year maturity), Notes (1-10 year), and Bonds (10+ years). This is the bulk of debt issuance and Fed purchases.

As can be seen below the Fed has monetized a large percentage of debt issued since Jan 2020. The focus is clearly seen in Notes and Bonds to keep a lid on long term rates. The first chart shows the debt added in each of the last 4 years by instrument. The bottom chart shows the percent of that debt the Fed has purchased. In 2020, the Fed monetized more than 100% of notes and 90% of bonds. In 2021 those numbers have fallen to 35% and 46% respectively. While not a complete monetization, this is still **massive** in terms of scope.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 6: Debt Issuance by Year and Instrument](

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 7: Fed Purchase &amp;#37; of Debt Issuance](

 

The final plot below takes a larger view of the balance sheet. It is clear to see how the usage of the balance sheet has changed since the Global Financial Crisis. The tapering from 2017-2019 can be seen in the slight dip before the massive surge due to Covid.

There is no way the Fed will come close to shrinking the balance sheet at this stage. With more Fiscal spending on the horizon and an economy addicted to low interest rates, it is probable that the growth of the balance sheet may accelerate rather than decelerate.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 8: Historical Fed Balance Sheet ](

# What it means for Gold and Silver

The Fed balance sheet is one of the drivers to the [expanding Money Supply]( The Fed monetary tools are used to keep rates low and cheap credit flowing. If the Fed keeps up the monetary stimulus, it will continue to drive inflation higher. If the Fed were to ever try and taper, allowing longer term rates to rise, it will put pressure on many areas of the economy, including the [Federal Deficit]( In either case, Gold and Silver should benefit from high inflation if the Fed keeps printing or a shrinking economy if the Fed tapers.","What is the Fed up to?!?

# EARNINGS ARE ACTUALLY 8/9

Earnings for Callaway are expected on 8/5. I've put every free dollar into 35C for 8/20.



Callaway is no longer just a golf company. They've expanded into multiple verticals:

1.	Golf equipment (Callaway, OGIO)
2.	Apparel (Jack Wolfskin, Travis Matthew)
3.	TopGolf

Why did I buy? Because golf is on a rebound. Last quarter, the golf equipment business and apparel alone pulled in an [EPS of 0.62]( this was during peak COVID. Equipment sales are up:

&gt;The surge in equipment sales that began last May is showing no signs of letting up. Through June, YTD combined golf club and ball wholesale dollar sales are up 77% over last year and 35% over 2019.

[source: National Golf Foundation](

This quarter, I expect the sales in the golf and apparel segments will be robust, along with additional revenue from [TopGolf](

TopGolf is a gamified driving range mixed with a restaurant. They print money. It's like $100 to rent a bay and the whole time you can order food and drinks. Imagine if you had to pay to rent a table at a restaurant. [Others have done DD showing how packed they always are]( People even beg on Twitter to have TopGolf come to their city. I personally love TopGolf.

They're opening new venues at a breakneck pace. [TopGolf just opened a new venue in NYC this weekend]( This year, they plan to open 8 new venues for a total of 69 while last year they had 61:

&gt;Globally, we have 66 company-owned venues in operation. For the full year, we are on track to open at least three more venues, for a total of at least eight venues this year. We also remain confident in our pipeline for future venues.

[source: Q1 2021 earnings call](

TopGolf originally was supposed to IPO on their own, valued at 4B, until the pandemic hit. TopGolf instead chose to sell the business to Callaway at a 2.5B valuation. **Currently, Callaway in total is valued at \~5.9B.** In a post-pandemic world, new golfers from the lockdown, new golfers from TopGolf, and a booming sportswear business [(which Nike proved is strong)]( I don't see how this valuation makes sense. Additionally, [TopTracer]( being sold to driving ranges across the world:

&gt;We successfully installed 1,533 bays in Q1, a new record despite the COVID challenges globally. We now have just over 10,000 bays globally, which is significantly more than our largest competitor. Demand remains strong for the product, and we are finding strong synergies between the Callaway sales team and the Toptracer team. We remain on track for 8,000 bays this year.

It seems every business segment will either meet or exceed expectations. Yet for some reason, analysts are stuck in the past- their thesis is that ""young people don't like golf."" What? My friends that don't play golf are always down to hit TopGolf, crush a few brews, and hang out. It's for hardcore/casual golfers alike.

This quarter, TopGolf will be fully included in earnings. [The average EPS estimate for this quarter is 0.01]( which I think completely ignores these facts. I also expect that the COVID shock from last year will have fully recovered. So now, Callaway has a bigger market from all the COVID golfers to sell golf shit, a sportswear business, and a money machine ala TopGolf. Callaway has been diversifying into a behemoth.

All in.",Callaway will smash earnings on 8/5. YOLO 35C 8/20,158,7

In full disclosure I lost over 300k on Chinese stocks in a combination of shares, warrants, and options. Yes, I am glad I sold because my losses would be even greater. 

1. Chinese entrepreneurs like to IPO in America because the entrepreneurs and VCs are given US dollars for their shares. For those that didn’t know it is almost impossible to move money out of China. This is true for American companies such as Apple and Starbucks, the money stays there. It is a closed capital account. IPOs in American markets means foreign investors (American investors) can get liquidity when investing in a Chinese company. 

2. The CCP was more than happy to allow American IPOs because they need US dollars. The world does not trust the Renminbi and it is only used in 1 percent of transactions compared to 60 percent for the US dollar. China must use US dollars to trade with the world. (If anyone is familiar with the Belt and Road you will know China uses dollars to fund such project). When Chinese investors and entrepreneurs are allowed to sell their shares in American markets they bring in US dollars. 

3. China has global ambitions of being a super power. After watching a certain guy (not trying to get political) get banned from social media and made irrelevant, Xi and the CCP woke up to the reality it could be next. The party then decided to crack down even further on its entrepreneurs, who the CCP believes may one day oppose it. The crack down on the Ant IPO was just the start. (For those who don’t know, China does not take criticism well. If Apple/Tesla was to criticize the CCP both businesses would fail to operate in China (this happened to Hilton for naming Taiwan as a country, but only for a week).This is why you see NO American CEOs or entrepreneurs criticize China. 

4. The SEC is finally acting. News has broke the SEC will not allow anymore Chinese IPOs without disclosure of the CCP’s control. Every company in China is subject to control by the CCP. You either comply or you are sent to a camp. You also have the threat of delisting because of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. 

At this point China has pissed off pretty much the entire US. From crashing internet money, to stocks, and don’t forget about their lies about COVID. I can’t imagine investors will bid up the price of these stocks again. Cut your loses and consider this market dead. Xi is a 1940s German leader reincarnated.",China Doesn’t Care About US Investor’s Money,9143,7
755,post,ovruu7,2th52,wallstreetbets,False,2021-08-01 06:11:22,https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ovruu7/whats_really_going_on_with_inflation/,self.wallstreetbets,,"In June 2021 inflation increased **5.4%** compared to June 2020 ([official release](

&amp;#x200B;

If we look at who were the main contributors of inflation, we see that *Used Cars &amp; Trucks* increased **10%** from March to April, **7.3%** from April to May and **10.5%** from May to June. The weight of *Used Cars &amp; Trucks* in the CPI is 3.166% (see Relative Importance column [here]( which means that in the last three months, **0.96%** of the CPI increase was due to an increase in prices of *Used Cars &amp; Trucks*.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue seems to be the global semiconductor shortage, that is slowing the production of Cars in the US and worldwide (for example: [here]( I'm however wondering if this is true (or fully true). If we look at the price increase for new cars, we can see that the price increase is ""just"" 5.3% compared to last year. Why would used cars prices increase 45% in one year while the new cars prices increased just by 5.3%? If there is a global shortage, shouldn't the prices of new cars also skyrocket?

[\(The first column is the weight in CPI, the second column is the YoY price change\)](

I also checked the how prices of electronic devices (such as smartphones, PCs, etc.) changed in the last year. In the image below you can see their prices deceased by 17.8%. So if there is a global shortage of chips that slowed down the production of cars and therefore increased the price of used cars, why price of electronic devices didn't increase accordingly?

[\(The first column is the weight in CPI, the second column is the YoY price change\)](

Finally, if we look at how the cost of renting cars and trucks increased over the last year, we see it increased by a whopping 87.7%, of which 45% just in the last 3 months.

[\(The first column is the weight in CPI, the second column is the YoY price change\)](

So my theory is that partially the increase is due to the semiconductor shortage, but most of the recent increase in used and cars prices, is the fact that due to re-opening economy people are traveling more and therefore renting more cars. As [this article]( mentions:

&amp;#x200B;

*""Essentially, car hire companies tend to order their fleets about two or three months in advance, at the start of the year -- and, having been stung with the low demand last year, they hedged their bets this year.*

*In fact, Sixt confirmed to CNN that its latest figures show that for Q1 of 2021, it had 93,200 cars across its global network. That compares to 130,900 in Q1 of 2020, and 129,200 for the same period in 2019. That's a 29% decrease in vehicles, year on year.""*

&amp;#x200B;

If you look at how the increases in car prices happened, the increase is mostly happened in the last 3 months, with the coming of summer, while before the increases were minimal, while the global semiconductor shortage was well known already in Q4-2020. So should we expect this increase in Used Cars &amp; Trucks to vanish by the end of the summer?

It is definitely trying hard to create a more conservative financial system while contributing to a more equal distribution of wealth. Say what you want, but that ain't bad news at all if you're a long term investor.

China wants to rely less on foreign fund flows because they see high speculation and bubble activity in Western countries and they don't want their domestic companies to be exposed to that euphoria and collapse risk. It's easy for a company to act recklessly in such an environment, and these reckless acts might ruin the Government's efforts towards a stable and healthy growing market.

Remember, China is a country lead by a collectivist mindset where the good of the mass is more important than the good of a single company or individual (which will frequently lead to abuse of the few for the many, in direct opposition to the policy of the US government which easily sacrifices the many for the few on top (not so much Western Europe). In the end the collective good turns out to be the company's best interest too.

They are not oblivious to the effects these measures have on the markets, even going as far as to post ads on the front page of every newspaper claiming that they are not in any way trying to harm tech companies, but actually helping them become more sustainable and resilient.

&amp;#x200B;

Was the crackdown on education stocks really a surprise?

In April the government released a document analyzing the education system of the country and already pointing out the problems they saw and possible corrective measures.

If somebody read those (and they should have if they owned the companies) they could have anticipated the sector to be caught in the regulation crossfire. But people don't do their due diligence and always act surprised when things go south. China is always clear about its intentions, we're just unable to understand them because we keep thinking in Western terms and taking our society and the companies we know as the ""default"" condition, which is fundamentally wrong.

Was the crackdown on Didi a surprise too?

Absolutely not. The government had explicitly recommended Didi delayed their IPO until certain data issues had been dealt with. Their main concern was making sure data breaches were avoided since, well, the US is literally their main competitor.

Didi ignored all this and went ahead. What followed was more than expected.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not pretending their totalitarian government that seeks to have absolute control over everything and every piece of information and conducts ethnic cleansing is in any way the most advanced form of human governance.

I'm simply pointing out that it is doing what it is doing because it wants to secure a strong and steady growth for its companies, and it knows that can only be achieved if it does not come at the expense of impoverishing its population and compromising healthy competition and fair-play in all sectors.

Only the western investor deeply embroiled in never-ending ATH's and euphoria can view the sustainable long-term measures as unsustainable and the unsustainable short-term bandaids as sustainable.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Now this is what I call a controversial fucking post. I guess time will tell.

The casino doesn't care about your stupid borders and your Murica koolaid, and neither do I.

 **John Saager**

The remainder of these questions are from the Say app. Sales of stock by key team members are being perceived by some as extreme with one shareholder claiming that our CTO, Tim Holme, sold 50% of his holdings. Noting that our Chief Legal Officer sold shares and our Chief Development Officer sold two-third of his shares. So the question becomes, is there anything to read into those share sales? And can you comment on the size of the share sale?

**Kevin Hettrich**

John, first, the percent of sale references in the questions are not accurate to correct the record here. As of the end of the quarter, Tim, our Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer, holds 96% of its prior holdings; as of June 30, 2021, Mohit Singh, our Chief Development Officer, holds 86%; and Mike McCarthy, our Chief Legal Officer holds 83%.

a quick look at their fins says it all. before merger

aphria sold 41m usd in weed last quarter
tlry sold 31 million

after merger, they recently reported 52m in weed sales which accounted for 100% apha and 4wks worth of tlry. which meant they were flat in sales qoq. these are like tier 3 mso numbers. 

on top of which, they're carrying about 3b in good will (most of it came from tlry) and 250m of weed inventory.  at their sales rate, it would take them over 2yrs to sell that. more than likely they would need to write down a signifcant portion of that inventory at some point. 

and they're valued at 7b. 

now they're looking to dilute further for some red herring that looks like mso acquisition but still smells like herring. truth is 1) they need to continue to acquire to grow rev to (hopefully, but doubtful)  justify their valuation since they can't sell weed (remember flat qoq growth and ballooning inventory) 2) they can't afford a tier 1 or 2 mso. 

institutional investors only hold about 10% of their float which is among the lowest of their peers. hell even aurora is 18% (which, in itself, is lunacy). canopy is about 25%. village farms near 40%. 10% are mso numbers and msos trade on the OTC where most funds can't invest!

skip the company pr, look at the official fins, check out their valuation, compare their numbers to any mso, and you'll come to the same conclusions. 

oh, and the current ceo makes outlandish money   note that the old tlry ceo Brendan Kennedy continues to dump his shares faster than you can say weedstocks. the guy is no dummy 

the only upside is that they're heavily shorted so can run up wildly like we saw with their recent er. but once people digested their fins (which were released after hours when their headline numbers were released premarket lol), looks like reality is setting in.

Covid is far from over and we probably will go through another circle of rotating into tech and then rotating into “recovery” plays. 

As long as the covid is not over, JPOW is unlikely to taper. And the longer this pandemic stretches, the more the world will adopt technologies. And more will move from offline to online. Calls on AAPL for all kinds of electrical devices. 

After more people adopt technologies, more companies will upgrade their tech stacks to meet the new service traffic and reliability demand. Calls on tech cloud and infrastructure companies like AMZN. 

And once the world adopts technologies, it won’t be able to leave and tech just have that sticky magic.

I've never done much with ITM options outside of buying them for leverage using LEAPS.

Here's my thesis:

I want to make an outsized bet that there will be some black swan event soon that could send the market toppling, or that inflation will start to get out of control fast and JPOW will do a 180 and go Paul Vlocker on this party and brutally murder the bull.

In the event of raising interest rates or a sudden and severe downturn, I suspect zombie companies will start to blow up left and right. The HYG ETF is comprised of junk bonds, many of which are companies I would consider teetering, especially if we have a rapid onset recession or rapid interest rate increases.

I was looking into selling ITM call credit spreads as a way to short the fund, with limited loss potential and without having to payout the dividend, pay borrow fees, or margin interest like I would if I was directly short.

Looking at specifically selling the $70c and buying the $88c for as close to $18 a spread as I can get. Experation can be variable but I'm looking for in the next 6 months.

Let's say I'm able to sell this spread for $17.95 and I sell 1000 of them. That's $1,795,000 in premium collected. If HYG collapses below $70c before expiration most of the intrinsic value will evaporate and I can close anywhere between break even and a $ million + payday. If I'm wrong I lose $0.05 ($5 per contract) per spread plus commission costs. ($5000 + $1300). So for a max loss of $6300 I could potentially make up to $1.7 million by shorting junk bonds when everyone is uncertain of the future.

The only risk I see is if I get assigned early, I'll have to exercise my long leg early to cover the short created on my assigned short call. Even in this case I only lose $5 per contract that gets assigned early on me.

The other ""risk"" I see is there's no way I can get filled that close to the risk free rate. ($18 a spread between $70c and $88c) maybe I'll have to adjust to $17.90 in which case max loss is $11,300. Or $17.85 where max loss is $16300.

So long as I can get reasonably close it seems like an absolute insane payout for just taking on early assignment risk.

What am I missing?

Am I really that likely to get assigned early on my short $70c leg?

Maybe we can offset the high price of gas we pay at the pump with some oil tendies. I found a trend in the chart with GUSH that would put the stock at 110 a share around SEPT 15th. The chart has been in a upward trend this past year and I see it to continue. With  oil prices on the rise oil companies are seeking oil rich areas in the Eagleford shale, Permian basin and Delaware basin.

Analysts are predicting oil production to rise into 2022

Looking ahead, Goldman Sachs sees Brent prices averaging above $80 in the third quarter, with potential spikes “well above” that level as demand comes roaring back. JPMorgan, meanwhile, expects crude oil prices to “decisively” break into the $80s during the final three months of the year.  Analysts at Bank of America are even more bullish. They argue Brent prices could see $100 in the summer of next year. That would mark a return to triple digits for the first time since 2014.  It comes as all three of the world’s main forecasting agencies — OPEC, the International Energy Agency and the U.S. Energy Information Administration — expect a demand-led recovery to pick up speed in the second half of 2021.March 2021, which is 1.4 million b/d more than February. The EIA estimates U.S. crude oil production rose to 10.9 million b/d in March and almost 11.0 million b/d in April..It's estimated that U.S. crude oil production will average 11.9 million b/d in 2022.

I drew some trend lines here on my webull chart where I'm predicting the price to be around sept 15. I noticed at around feb 1 that the stonk was roughly $50 a share. It rose $40 higher to top out roughly $90 a share and then fell $30 to bottom around 60 a share. . The stock continued this pattern to top out $10 higher a share each time and, to fall and stop $10 higher than the last bottom. All dips at lows around two and a half months apart.

Obviously, every single one of them has been wrong so far.

Here's the reality of it. If you are trying to predict the next market crash - you are either dumb, overconfident or both. I've been TAing all of the indexes on a daily basis for a long time - and the charts have been **objectively bullish** ever since last April. In fact, they have been like that for a while. SPY just bull flags perpetually aside from a few **outliers** like last March, December 2018, etc. Obviously we don't always go up this fast - but there is a good reason I don't swing puts much.

Pretty much every time SPY (or any other index) get's close to breaking an important trendline or level - it bounces. There is some stick save at the end of the day or the end of the week - every time.  The only reason people think their charts are saying death is because they are deluded by their own biases - or don't understand how to use technical analysis.

Now - there are ways to tell when you can gain an edge in predicting a SPY correction. For one, wait until we form a **bearish continuation pattern.** This means we've dropped a few percent - and then we've formed a bear flag, bear pennant, etc. This does not happen often. We usually get violent bounces, rather than sideways chop upwards. Bears fall for it every single time. Either way - these patterns do not indicate a major market crash, they simply mean we will make a routine move downwards - there is **no pattern that indicates a major market crash.** These are **outliers** and the whole point of technical analysis is gaining an edge in market movements by looking at patterns that have repeated **hundreds of thousands of times since the market was a thing.**

If anyone wants me to go into more details of why the charts have been bullish - let me know - but I know that will make the post too long for you retards to read.

Lastly - if you can read it on the news online - it's priced in. You aren't going to predict the next Black Swan with a Yahoo Finance Article. Honestly - just stop trying to predict anything. Way too many people here think they can predict a move in a stock or the market with 100% accuracy. You can't, no matter who you are. You can only gain an edge. What Burry did was not only a gamble, but an extremely rare scenario.

No one knows when the next major crash will be or when the party will stop. Just go with the flow and don't be the last one holding the bag. When the trend flips, we will know - but for the last 10 years we have pretty much gone straight up. No one cares about your bear fan fiction.
